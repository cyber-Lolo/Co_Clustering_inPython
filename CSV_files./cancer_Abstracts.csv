1,"Tobacco product use rates among Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NHPI), Asian 
American, and Filipino American young adults in Hawai'i have risen rapidly in 
recent years following the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems. 
Though some research has examined tobacco use correlates for these demographics 
of young adults, research examining protective factors, such as cultural 
connectedness, is lacking. Additionally, research that disaggregates Asian 
Americans from Pacific Islanders is scarce, despite the differing risk and 
protective factors that have been determined for each group. This study 
separately examined cultural connectedness among NHPIs, Asian Americans, and 
Filipino Americans to help fill the gaps in the current tobacco product 
literature. The findings indicated that Asian Americans and Filipino Americans 
who identify more with their own cultures are less likely to use e-cigarettes; 
however, this relationship was not supported for NHPIs. No significant evidence 
was found to indicate a relationship between cultural connectedness and 
combustible cigarette use among any of the sampled groups. The lack of 
relationship between cultural connectedness and e-cigarette use among Native 
Hawaiians may be explained by measurement limitations in the study, and suggest 
the need for more culturally competent scales (e.g., an enculturation scale) 
that account for Indigenous status."
2,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The development of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) 
immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of several cancers. Malignancies 
are one of the leading causes of death in solid organ transplant recipients 
(SOTRs). Although ICI treatment may be an effective option in treating 
malignancies in SOTRs, concerns about triggering allograft rejection have been 
raised in this population. Herein, we will review currently available data 
regarding patients, allograft and malignancy outcomes in SOTRs who received ICI 
therapy.
RECENT FINDINGS: Cancer incidence is three to five-fold higher among SOTRs, 
compared with the general population. Skin cancer is the most prevalent cancer 
after transplant, followed by kidney cancer, lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma. There 
are no large prospective studies evaluating ICI therapy's use for treating 
cancers in SOTRs. However, retrospective studies have shown that ICI treatment 
may be associated with improved malignancy outcomes and overall survival (OS). 
However, the risk of allograft rejection is high (around 40%) of whom about half 
lose their allograft. Maintaining higher levels of immunosuppression may be 
associated with a lower risk of allograft rejection, but potentially worse 
malignancy outcomes.
SUMMARY: Although ICI treatment may be associated with improved patient and 
malignancy outcomes, the risk of allograft rejection and loss are high. 
Prospective studies are needed to confirm the benefits of ICI therapy in SOTRs 
and to evaluate the optimal immunosuppression regimen modifications, if any, to 
improve patient, malignancy and allograft outcomes in transplant recipients."
3,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumor types 
occurring in the digestive system. The incidence of CRC has exhibits yearly 
increases and the mortality rate among patients with CRC is high. The 
Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway, which is associated with carcinogenesis, is 
abnormally activated in CRC. Most patients with CRC have adenomatous polyposis 
coli mutations, while half of the remaining patients have β‑catenin gene 
mutations. Therefore, targeting the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway for the 
treatment of CRC is of clinical value. In recent years, with in‑depth research 
on the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway, inhibitors have been developed that are 
able to suppress or hinder the development and progression of CRC. In the 
present review, the role of the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway in CRC is 
summarized, the research status on Wnt/β‑catenin pathway inhibitors is outlined 
and potential targets for inhibition of this pathway are presented."
4,"Genetic alterations drive tumor onset and progression. However, the cross‑talk 
between tumor cells and the benign components of the surrounding stroma can also 
promote the initiation, progression and metastasis of solid tumors. These 
cellular and non‑cellular stromal components form the tumor microenvironment 
(TME), which co‑evolves with tumor cells. Their dynamic and mutualistic 
interactions are currently considered to be among the distinctive hallmarks of 
cancer. Biochemical and physical cues from the TME serve an essential role in 
regulating tumor onset and progression. They are also associated with resistance 
to treatment and poor prognosis in patients with cancer. Therefore, a deep 
understanding of the TME is vital for developing potent anticancer therapeutics 
and improving patient outcomes. The present review aims to review the biology of 
both cellular and non‑cellular constituents of the TME and novel findings 
regarding their contribution to core as well as emerging cancer hallmarks. The 
present review also describes key TME markers that are either targeted in 
interventional clinical trials or serve as promising potential anticancer 
therapies. Understanding TME components and their intercellular interactions is 
key toward identifying the mechanisms of progression and treatment resistance. 
Such understanding is of utmost significance for personalized and effective 
cancer therapy strategies."
5,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) remains one of the best molecules 
for developing targeted therapy for multiple human malignancies, including head 
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Small molecule inhibitors or 
antibodies targeting EGFR have been extensively developed in recent decades. 
Immunotoxin (IT)‑based therapy, which combines cell surface binding ligands or 
antibodies with a peptide toxin, represents another cancer treatment option. A 
total of 3 diphtheria toxin (DT)‑based fusion toxins that target human 
EGFR‑monovalent EGFR IT (mono‑EGF‑IT), bivalent EGFR IT (bi‑EGF‑IT), and a 
bispecific IT targeting both EGFR and interleukin‑2 receptor (bis‑EGF/IL2‑IT) 
were recently generated by the authors. Improved efficacy and reduced toxicity 
of bi‑EGF‑IT compared with mono‑EGF‑IT in immunocompromised HNSCC mouse models 
was reported. In the present study, bis‑EGF/IL2‑IT were generated using a unique 
DT‑resistant yeast expression system and evaluated the in vitro and in vivo 
efficacy and toxicity of the 3 EGF‑ITs in immunocompetent mice. The results 
demonstrated that while the three EGF‑ITs had different efficacies in vitro and 
in vivo against HNSCC, bi‑EGF‑IT and bis‑EGF/IL2‑IT had significantly improved 
in vivo efficacy and remarkably less off‑target toxicity compared with 
mono‑EGF‑IT. In addition, bis‑EGF/IL2‑IT was superior to bi‑EGF‑IT in reducing 
tumor size and prolonging survival in the metastatic model. These data suggested 
that targeting either the tumor immune microenvironment or enhancing the binding 
affinity could improve the efficacy of IT‑based therapy. Bi‑EGF‑IT and 
bis‑EGF/IL2‑IT represent improved candidates for IT‑based therapy for future 
clinical development."
6,"Cancer liquid biopsy (CLB) aims for the detection of circulating tumor cells, 
cell‑free DNA or RNA, and specifically expressed proteins, lipids and 
metabolites present in the bio‑fluids of patients. Rapid advances in 
technologies for sampling such bio‑specimens and for genomic sequencing have 
fostered the development of authority‑approved CLB tests in clinical practice 
for the early screening and diagnosis of malignancies. However, perhaps some 
solid tumors could have been reliably detected using CLB, while they were still 
too small to be found in patients using currently available imaging 
technologies. This could impose troublesome clinical scenarios. In this 
communication article, the author would like to propose a potential solution 
that eventually may be used to combat such unwanted embarrassing clinical issues 
by using one episode of targeted radiotheragnostics, namely OncoCiDia."
7,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of cancer‑associated death 
in the world. Chemotherapy remains the primary treatment method for HCC. Despite 
advances in chemotherapy and modalities, recurrence and resistance limit 
therapeutic success. Salidroside (Sal), a bioactive component extracted from the 
rhizome of Rhodiola rosea L, exhibits a spectrum of biological activities 
including antitumor effects. In the present study, it was demonstrated that Sal 
could induce apoptosis and autophagy of 97H cells by using CCK‑8 assay, 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Hoechst33342 staining, MDC staining, 
western blotting. Pretreatment with Sal enhanced apoptosis and autophagy via 
upregulation of expression levels of Bax, Caspase‑3, Caspase‑9, light chain 
(LC)3‑II and Beclin‑1 proteins and downregulation of expression levels of Bcl‑2, 
LC3‑I and p62 protein in 97H cells. Furthermore, Sal was demonstrated to inhibit 
activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and, when combined with 
autophagy inhibitor chloroquine diphosphate (CQ), increased phosphorylation of 
PI3K, Akt and mTOR proteins. The combined treatment with Sal and CQ not only 
decreased Sal‑induced autophagy, but also accelerated Sal‑induced apoptosis. 
Therefore, Sal‑induced autophagy might serve a role as a defense mechanism in 
human liver cancer cells and its inhibition may be a promising strategy for the 
adjuvant chemotherapy of liver cancer."
8,"The mechanism underlying bladder cancer metastasis is associated with tumor 
angiogenesis. The present study aimed to evaluate the predictive role and value 
of an angiogenesis‑associated long non‑coding (lnc)RNA signature in patients 
with bladder cancer and the role of long intergenic non‑coding RNA (LINC)02321 
in the progression of this malignancy. Angiogenesis‑related lncRNAs were 
screened using Pearson correlation analysis and the signaturewas constructed 
using Cox regression analysis and evaluated using the receiver operating 
characteristic curve. LINC02321, which expressed the largest difference in 
bladder cancer, was screened using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. The 
role of LINC02321 in the malignant progression of bladder cancer was evaluated 
using Transwell, wound healing and Cell Counting Kit 8 assays. A total of six 
angiogenesis‑associated lncRNAs (USP30‑AS1, LINC02321, PSMB8‑AS1, KRT7‑AS, 
LINC01767 and OCIAD1‑AS1) were identified as candidates for the prognostic 
signature using Cox regression analysis. The overall survival of patients in the 
low‑risk group was significantly longer compared with that in the high‑risk 
group, with the highest area under the curve value being 0.807. A nomogram was 
constructed based on the traditional clinical indicators (age, sex, grade, 
American Joint Committee on Cancer stage) and risk score of patients. Compared 
with the traditional clinical indicators, the risk score demonstrated better 
clinical prediction capacity for predicting the prognosis of patients with 
bladder cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas prediction and RT‑qPCR experimental 
results demonstrated that only LINC02321 was highly expressed in bladder cancer 
tissue and promoted the proliferation, invasion, migration and cisplatin 
resistance of the malignancy. Gene set enrichment, Pearson's correlation 
analysis and experimental results demonstrated that the VEGFA signalling pathway 
may be involved in the LINC02321‑regulated progression of bladder cancer. In 
conclusion, the six angiogenesis‑associated lncRNA signatures reported in the 
present study may be used to predict the prognosis of patients with bladder 
cancer, and LINC02321 promoted malignant progression of bladder cancer via the 
VEGFA signalling pathway."

10,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid membrane-bound particles involved in 
cell-to-cell communication through a delivery of regulatory molecules essential 
for physiological processes. Since EVs efficiently vectorize specific cargo 
molecules, they have been proposed as suitable vehicles for therapeutic agents. 
Drug loading into EVs can be achieved by active, exogenous strategies or by 
genetic modifications of vesicle-producing cells. With the aim to produce EVs 
conveying therapeutic proteins, we genetically engineered and compared HEK293 to 
tumor cells. Tetraspanin-based RFP fusions were found to be more stable and 
preferentially sorted into EVs in HEK293. EVs isolated from genetically modified 
HEK293 cells media were captured by cancer cells, efficiently delivering their 
cargo. Cathepsin B cleavage site introduced between CD9/CD81 and RFP was 
recognized by tumor specific proteases allowing the release of the reporter 
protein. Our results indicate HEK293 cells as a preferential system for the 
production of EVs and pave the way to the development of nano-platforms for the 
efficient delivery of therapeutic proteins and prodrugs to tumor cells."
11,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor leading cancer-associated 
high mortality worldwide. Unfortunately, the most commonly used drug 
therapeutics not only lack of target ability and efficiency, but also exhibit 
severe systemic toxicity to normal tissues. Thus, effective and targeted 
nanodrug of HCC therapy is emerging as a more important issue. Here, we design 
and develop the novel nanomicelles, namely Mannose-polyethylene glycol 
600-Nitroimidazole (Man-NIT). This micelle compound with high purity comprise 
two parts, which can self-assemble into nanoscale micelle. The outer shell is 
selected mannose as hydrophilic moiety, while the inner core is nitroimidazole 
as hydrophobic moiety. In the cell experiment, Man-NIT was more cellular uptake 
by HCCLM3 cells due to the mannose modification. Mannose as a kind of glucose 
transporter 1 (GLUT1) substrate, can specifically recognize and bind to 
over-expressed GLUT1 on carcinoma cytomembrane. The nitroimidazole moiety of 
Man-NIT was reduced by the over-expressed nitroreductase with reduced 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as the cofactor, resulting 
in transient deletion of NADPH and glutathione (GSH). The increase of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) in HCCLM3 cells disturbed the balance of redox, and finally 
caused the death of tumor cells. Additional in vivo experiment was conducted 
using twenty-four male BALB/c nude mice to build the tumor model. The results 
showed that nanomicelles were accumulated in the liver of mice. The tumor size 
and pathological features were obviously improved after nanomicelles treatment. 
It indicates that namomicelles have a tumor inhibition effect, especially 
Man-NIT, which may be a potential nanodrug of chemotherapeutics for HCC therapy."
12,"Five-year survival of pancreatic cancer (PC) remains low. Murine models may not 
adequately mimic human PC and can be too small for medical device development. A 
large animal PC model could address these issues. We induced and characterized 
pancreatic tumors in Oncopigs (transgenic swine containing KRASG12D and 
TP53R167H). Oncopigs underwent injection of adenovirus expressing Cre 
recombinase (AdCre) into one of the main pancreatic ducts. Resultant tumors were 
characterized by histology, cytokine expression, exome sequencing and 
transcriptome analysis. Ten out of fourteen Oncopigs (71%) had gross tumor 
within three weeks. At necropsy all of these subjects had gastric outlet 
obstruction secondary to pancreatic tumor and phlegmon. Oncopigs with injections 
without Cre recombinase and wild type pigs with AdCre injection did not show 
notable effect. Exome and transcriptome analysis of the porcine pancreatic 
tumors revealed similarity with the molecular signatures and pathways of human 
PC. While further optimization and validation of this porcine PC model would be 
beneficial, it is anticipated that this model will be useful for focused 
research and development of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies for PC."
13,"Tuberculosis remains a global health threat with high morbidity. Dendritic cells 
(DCs) participate in the acute and chronic inflammatory responses to 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by directing the adaptive immune response and 
are present in lung granulomas. In macrophages, the interaction of lipid 
droplets (LDs) with mycobacteria-containing phagosomes is central to 
host-pathogen interactions. However, the data available for DCs are still a 
matter of debate. Here, we reported that bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) were 
susceptible to Mtb infection and replication at similar rate to macrophages. 
Unlike macrophages, the analysis of gene expression showed that Mtb infection 
induced a delayed increase in lipid droplet-related genes and proinflammatory 
response. Hence, LD accumulation has been observed by high-content imaging in 
late periods. Infection of BMDCs with killed H37Rv demonstrated that LD 
accumulation depends on Mtb viability. Moreover, infection with the attenuated 
strains H37Ra and M. bovis-BCG induced only an early transient increase in LDs, 
whereas virulent Mtb also induced delayed LD accumulation. In addition, 
infection with the BCG strain with the reintroduced virulence RD1 locus induced 
higher LD accumulation and bacterial replication when compared to parental BCG. 
Collectively, our data suggest that delayed LD accumulation in DCs is dependent 
on mycobacterial viability and virulence."
14,"BACKGROUND: The accuracy of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) as a diagnostic marker for 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is insufficient, and the application of abnormal 
prothrombin (PIVKA-II) in HCC is still controversial.
METHODS: Serum AFP and PIVKA-II levels were analyzed in 145 cases of HCC, 57 of 
benign liver disease, 55 of cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma, 112 of 
other gastrointestinal tumors with liver metastasis, and 101 healthy controls. 
Receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were used to 
evaluate the diagnostic value of AFP and PIVKA-II for HCC. The changes in serum 
AFP and PIVKA-II levels before and after treatment in 47 HCC patients who 
underwent surgery and 77 who received interventional treatment were used to 
evaluate treatment efficacy and prognosis in HCC.
RESULTS: The concentrations of AFP and PIVKA-II in the HCC group were 
significantly higher than those in other groups (p < 0.01). The diagnostic value 
of PIVKA-II in HCC was better than that of AFP, and combined detection improved 
the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. The levels of AFP and PIVKA-II after 
liver cancer surgery were significantly lower than those before surgery. 
Elevated levels of PIVKA-II before surgery predicted disease progression, and 
patients who remained positive for PIVKA-II after surgery had worse prognosis 
than those who became negative after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined detection of AFP and PIVKA-II is superior to both tests 
alone. We found that higher serum level of PIVKA-II indicates more severe HCC, 
with worse prognosis, while the level of AFP had no correlation with the 
prognosis."
15,"The present study aims to evaluate the pretherapeutic Fibrinogen-Albumin-Ratio 
Index (FARI), as currently reliable biomarkers to predict therapy response and 
prognosis of patients with advanced vulvar cancer are missing. Data of 124 
consecutive patients, who underwent primary resection for vulvar cancer ≥ pT1b, 
were retrospectively analyzed. Associations between the FARI and disease 
recurrence were assessed fitting receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and 
binary logistic regression models; univariate and multivariable Cox regression 
models for disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) 
were performed. A pretherapeutic low FARI cut at its median (&lt;9.67) is 
significantly associated with younger age (65.5 vs. 74.0 years) and higher risk 
of recurrence (52.4% vs. 26.2%). The ROC analysis calculates the area under the 
curve (AUC) of the FARI for a PFS &lt; 6 months of 0.700 and for a DSS &lt; 12 
months of 0.706, outperforming fibrinogen and albumin alone. The FARI remained 
independently predictive for PFS (HR 0.84, 95% CI [0.99-1.03], p = 0.009) and 
DSS (HR 0.82, 95% CI [0.70-0.99], p = 0.019), also in multivariable survival 
analysis. Despite the FARI's promising predictive and prognostic value, however, 
further elucidation of its precise mode of action is warranted before clinical 
application as it appears to rely only on subtle changes of fibrinogen levels."
16,"Radiotherapy (RT) is a mainstay of treatment for brain tumors. To minimize the 
risk of side effects while maximizing the therapeutic effects, personalized 
treatment plans, consisting mainly of genomics, radiomics, and mathematical 
modeling, are increasingly being used. We hypothesize that personality 
characteristics could influence treatment outcomes and thus could be used to 
help personalize RT. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the 
psychological characteristics associated with post-treatment physical status and 
quality of life (QoL) in patients with brain tumors undergoing RT. Two 
psychological tests-the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and the State-Trait 
Anxiety Inventory-were administered prior to RT. Physical parameters before and 
after RT were also assessed through the following tests: hand grip strength, 
Timed Up and Go test, 6 Min Walk Test, and Functional Independence Measure. The 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) was used to assess QoL. 
The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) was 
administered to assess fatigue. Neuroticism was significantly associated with 
low FACT-G Physical Well-Being scores. Psychoticism was associated with an 
improvement in physical fitness scores after RT. These findings suggest that 
personality traits should be considered when designing a personalized 
radiotherapy plan."
17,"OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based 
radiomics models for high-risk endometrial cancer (EC) prediction 
preoperatively, to be able to estimate deep myometrial invasion (DMI) and 
lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and to discriminate between low-risk and 
other categories of risk as proposed by ESGO/ESTRO/ESP (European Society of 
Gynaecological Oncology-European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology and 
European Society of Pathology) guidelines.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 96 women with EC who underwent 1.5-T 
MR imaging before surgical staging between April 2009 and May 2019 in two 
referral centers divided into training (T = 73) and validation cohorts (V = 23). 
Radiomics features were extracted using the MODDICOM library with manual 
delineation of whole-tumor volume on MR images (axial T2-weighted). Diagnostic 
performances of radiomic models were evaluated by area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve in training (AUCT) and validation (AUCV) 
cohorts by using a subset of the most relevant texture features tested 
individually in univariate analysis using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney.
RESULTS: A total of 228 radiomics features were extracted and ultimately limited 
to 38 for DMI, 29 for LVSI, and 15 for risk-classes prediction for logistic 
radiomic modeling. Whole-tumor radiomic models yielded an AUCT/AUCV of 0.85/0.68 
in DMI estimation, 0.92/0.81 in LVSI prediction, and 0.84/0.76 for 
differentiating low-risk vs other risk classes 
(intermediate/high-intermediate/high).
CONCLUSION: MRI-based radiomics has great potential in developing advanced 
prognostication in EC."
18,"Pancreatic cancer is mainly driven by mutations in the KRAS oncogene. While this 
cancer has shown remarkable therapy resistance, new approaches to inhibit 
mutated KRAS, KRAS activators and effectors show promise in breaking this 
therapeutic deadlock. Here, we review these innovations in therapies that target 
RAS signaling in pancreatic cancer from a clinical point of view. A number of 
promising approaches are currently in clinical trials or in clinical 
development. We focus on small-molecule drugs but also discuss immunotherapies 
and tumor vaccines."
19,"PURPOSE: This study utilized a radiomics approach combined with a machine 
learning algorithm to distinguish primary lung cancer (LC) from solitary lung 
metastasis (LM) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with a solitary pulmonary 
nodule (SPN).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study, 239 patients who underwent 
chest computerized tomography (CT) at three different institutions between 2011 
and 2019 and were diagnosed as primary LC or solitary LM were included. The data 
from the first institution were divided into training and internal testing 
datasets. The data from the second and third institutions were used as an 
external testing dataset. Radiomic features were extracted from the intra and 
perinodular regions of interest (ROI). After a feature selection process, 
Support vector machine (SVM) was used to train models for classifying between LC 
and LM. The performances of the SVM classifiers were evaluated with both the 
internal and external testing datasets. The performances of the model were 
compared to those of two radiologists who reviewed the CT images of the testing 
datasets for the binary prediction of LC versus LM.
RESULTS: The SVM classifier trained with the radiomic features from the 
intranodular ROI and achieved the sensitivity/specificity of 0.545/0.828 in the 
internal test dataset, and 0.833/0.964 in the external test dataset, 
respectively. The SVM classifier trained with the combined radiomic features 
from the intra- and perinodular ROIs achieved the sensitivity/specificity of 
0.545/0.966 in the internal test dataset, and 0.833/1.000 in the external test 
data set, respectively. Two radiologists demonstrated the 
sensitivity/specificity of 0.545/0.966 and 0.636/0.828 in the internal test 
dataset, and 0.917/0.929 and 0.833/0.929 in the external test dataset, which 
were comparable to the performance of the model trained with the combined 
radiomics features.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that the machine learning classifiers trained 
using radiomics features of SPN in CRC patients can be used to distinguish the 
primary LC and the solitary LM with a similar level of performance to 
radiologists."
20,"Disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is influenced by activation of 
circulating and synovial immune cells. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and monocytes 
are key cells that drive inflammation in RA. This study investigated if a 
relationship exists between disease activity in RA and circulating Treg and 
monocyte numbers and phenotypes. A potential sialic acid (Sia) mediated link 
between Tregs and monocytes was also probed in vitro. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from RA patient (n = 62) and healthy 
control (n = 21) blood using density gradient separation. Flow cytometry was 
used to count and phenotype Treg and monocyte subsets, and to sort healthy 
control Tregs for Sia cell culture experiments. The effects of Sia on activated 
Treg FoxP3 and NFκB expression was assessed by flow cytometry and concentrations 
of secreted TNFα, IL-10 and IFNγ determined by ELISA. High disease activity RA 
patients who were unresponsive to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (n = 
31), have significantly lower relative numbers (percentages) of CD4+CD25+CD127- 
Tregs (p &lt; 0.01) and memory CD45RA-FoxP3+ Tregs (p &lt; 0.01), compared to 
low disease activity responders (n = 24). Relative numbers of non-classical 
CD169+ monocytes are associated with disease activity in RA (p = 0.012). Sia 
reduced Treg expression of FoxP3, NFκB and cytokines in vitro. A strong 
association has been identified between non-classical CD169+ monocytes and 
post-treatment disease activity in RA. This study also indicates that Sia can 
reduce Treg activation and cytokine release. We postulate that such a reduction 
could be mediated by interaction with sialyted proteins captured by CD169+ 
monocytes."
21,"Postoperative complications such as seroma formation and wound-site infection 
occur following completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for melanoma. 
We analyzed the impact of time-to-drain removal and drainage volume on seroma 
formation after ALND. We retrospectively analyzed data from 118 patients after 
completion ALND for melanoma. Primary endpoints were daily amount of drainage 
volume, seroma formation and time-to-drain removal. Secondary endpoints included 
patient-related, disease-specific and perioperative parameters as well as the 
number of histologically analyzed lymph nodes and surgical complications graded 
by the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDCL). Statistical analyses were performed 
using logistic regression models. Drain removal around the 8th postoperative day 
was statistically associated with a lower risk for the occurrence of seroma 
formation (p &lt; 0.001). Patients with an increased drainage volume during the 
early postoperative days were more prone to develop seroma after drain removal. 
With 49% (CDCL I and II), most complications were managed conservatively, while 
only 5.9% (CDCL III) required revision surgery (CDCL overall: 55.9%). ALND is a 
safe procedure with a low rate of severe CDCL III type of complications. To 
decrease seroma evacuation, our results imply that drains should be removed 
around the 8th postoperative day to reduce the risk of infection, readmission or 
prolonged hospitalization."
22,"Synergistic drug combinations often provide effective strategies to increase 
treatment efficacy and, during therapy, it is a time-dependent process. Data for 
colorectal and lung cancer in vivo were used for the phenomenological study of 
dynamical synergy during treatments. The proposed approach takes into 
consideration tumor regrowth by macroscopic laws. The time dependencies of 
synergistic drug combinations are analyzed by different parametric indicators. 
The cumulative effects of the single therapy and drug combinations are 
quantitatively well described and related to the cumulative doses. In 
conclusion, the analysis of dynamical synergy during chemotherapy has to take 
into account the effects of the drug doses and the tumor regrowth, which can 
provide a reliable description of the synergistic time dependence."
23,"Lung cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide. Numerous 
medications targeting specific molecular alterations in non-small cell lung 
cancer have been introduced in the last decade and have revolutionized the 
clinical management of the disease. Their use has brought to a parallel 
evolution of molecular testing techniques to identify alterations in druggable 
molecular targets within the genetic material of the tumors. To perform 
molecular testing, biopsy or surgery tissue specimens are needed, which in 
addition allow the histological characterization of the tumors. Unfortunately, 
in real-life practice not all the patients are suitable for biopsy or surgery 
procedures. The use of liquid biopsy for blood extracted tumoral DNA analysis is 
a promising approach in unbiopsied cases, but it is also weighted by several 
methodological and technical limitations. We report here a case of 
histologically undiagnosed lung cancer managed with a liquid biopsy and 
subsequently with anti-EGFR treatment. Our report highlights that the use of 
liquid biopsy molecular testing in specific clinical situations can offer 
treatment opportunities for fragile patients affected by lung cancer."
24,"We describe our institutional experience of developing a liquid biopsy approach 
using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis for personalized medicine in cancer 
patients, focusing on the hurdles encountered during the multistep process in 
order to benefit other investigators wishing to set up this type of study in 
their institution. Blood samples were collected at the time of cancer surgery 
from 209 patients with one of nine different cancer types. Extracted tumor DNA 
and circulating cell-free DNA were sequenced using cancer-specific panels and 
the Illumina MiSeq machine. Almost half of the pairs investigated were 
uninformative, mostly because there was no trackable pathogenic mutation 
detected in the original tumor. The pairs with interpretable data corresponded 
to 107 patients. Analysis of 48 gene sequences common to both panels was 
performed and revealed that about 40% of these pairs contained at least one 
driver mutation detected in the DNA extracted from plasma. Here, we describe the 
choice of our overall approach, the selection of the cancer panels, and the 
difficulties encountered during the multistep process, including the use of 
several tumor types and in the data analysis. We also describe some case reports 
using longitudinal samples, illustrating the potential advantages and rewards in 
performing ctDNA sequencing to monitor tumor burden or guide treatment for 
cancer patients."
25,"Preeclampsia and gestational hypertensive disorders (GHD) are common 
complications of pregnancy that adversely affect maternal and offspring health, 
often with long-term consequences. High BMI, advanced age, and pre-existing 
conditions are known risk factors for GHD. Yet, assessing a woman's risk of GHD 
based on only these characteristics needs to be reevaluated in order to identify 
at-risk women, facilitate early diagnosis, and implement lifestyle 
recommendations. This study demonstrates that a risk score developed with 
machine learning from the case-control genetics dataset can be used as an early 
screening test for GHD. We further confirm BMI as a risk factor for GHD and 
investigate a relationship between GHD and genetically constructed 
anthropometric measures and biomarkers. Our results show that polygenic risk 
score can be used as an early screening tool that, together with other known 
risk factors and medical history, would assist in identifying women at higher 
risk of GHD before its onset to enable stratification of patients into low-risk 
and high-risk groups for monitoring and preventative programs to mitigate the 
risks."
26,"ETS-related gene (ERG) fusion affects prostate cancer depending on the degree of 
expression of ERG. Solute Carrier Family 45 Member 3 (SLC45A3) is the 
second-most common 5' partner gene of ERG rearrangement. However, the molecular 
pathological features of SLC45A3:ERG (S:E) fusion and therapeutic methods have 
not been studied at all. S:E fusion-positive cancers (n = 10) were selected from 
the Tumor Fusion Gene Data Portal website. Fusion-negative cancers (n = 50) were 
selected by sorting ERG expression level in descending order and selecting the 
bottom to 50th sample. Totally, 1325 ERG correlated genes were identified by a 
Pearson correlation test using over 0.3 of absolute correlation coefficiency 
(|R| &gt; 0.3). Pathway analysis was performed using over-representation 
analysis of correlated genes, and seven cancer-related pathways (focal adhesion 
kinase (FAK)/PI3K-Akt, JAK-STAT, Notch, receptor tyrosine kinase/PDGF, TGF-β, 
VEGFA, and Wnt signaling) were identified. In particular, focal adhesion kinase 
(FAK)/PI3K-Akt signaling and JAK-STAT signaling were significantly enriched in 
S:E fusion-positive prostate cancer. We further identified therapeutic targets 
and candidate drugs for S:E fusion-positive prostate cancer using gene-drug 
network analysis. Interestingly, PDGFRA and PDGFRB were the most frequently 
predicted therapeutic targets, and imatinib targeted both genes. In this study, 
we provide extensive information on cellular signaling pathways involved in S:E 
fusion-positive prostate cancer and also suggest therapeutic methods."
27,"In this randomized controlled study, we aimed to assess the effects of US-guided 
injections of the subacromial bursa followed by a personalized rehabilitation 
program for breast cancer (BC) survivors. We assessed patients with subacromial 
pain syndrome without tendon lesions and with a history of post-surgical 
non-metastatic BC. Thirty-seven patients were enrolled and randomly assigned 1:1 
to receive US-guided corticosteroid injections combined with a personalized 
rehabilitation program (Group A; n: 19) or US-guided corticosteroid injections 
alone (Group B; n: 18). The primary outcome was pain relief, assessed using a 
numerical pain rating scale (NPRS). The secondary outcomes were muscle strength, 
shoulder function, and quality of life. No major or minor late effects were 
reported after the multidisciplinary intervention. Statistically significant 
within-group differences were found in terms of NPRS (p ≤ 0.05) in both groups. 
No significant between-group differences were reported after one week. However, 
the between-group analysis showed significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) after three 
months of follow-up in terms of pain intensity, muscle strength, shoulder 
function, and quality of life. Our findings suggested positive effects of a 
multidisciplinary approach including US-guided corticosteroid injections 
combined with a personalized rehabilitation program in improving pain intensity 
and quality of life of BC survivors with subacromial pain syndrome."
28,"Germline and tumor BRCA testing constitutes a valuable tool for clinical 
decision-making in the management of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. 
Tissue testing is able to identify both germline (g) and somatic (s) BRCA 
variants, but tissue preservation methods and the widespread implementation of 
NGS represent pre-analytical and analytical challenges that need to be managed. 
This study was carried out on a multicenter prospective GEICO cohort of EOC 
patients with known gBRCA status in order to determine the inter-laboratory 
reproducibility of tissue sBRCA testing. The study consisted of two independent 
experimental approaches, a bilateral comparison between two reference 
laboratories (RLs) testing 82 formalin-paraffin-embedded (FFPE) EOC samples 
each, and a Ring Test Trial (RTT) with five participating clinical laboratories 
(CLs) evaluating the performance of tissue BRCA testing in a total of nine 
samples. Importantly, labs employed their own locally adopted next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) analytical approach. BRCA mutation frequency in the RL 
sub-study cohort was 23.17%: 12 (63.1%) germline and 6 (31.6%) somatic. 
Concordance between the two RLs with respect to BRCA status was 84.2% (gBRCA 
100%). The RTT study distributed a total of nine samples (three commercial 
synthetic human FFPE references, three FFPE, and three OC DNA) among five CLs. 
The median concordance detection rate among them was 64.7% (range: 35.3-70.6%). 
Analytical discrepancies were mainly due to the minimum variant allele frequency 
thresholds, bioinformatic pipeline filters, and downstream variant 
interpretation, some of them with consequences of clinical relevance. Our study 
demonstrates a wide range of concordance in the identification and 
interpretation of BRCA sequencing data, highlighting the relevance of 
establishing standard criteria for detecting, interpreting, and reporting BRCA 
variants."
29,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic multifactorial and complex 
neuro-degenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and the loss of 
cognitive ability, which is a problem affecting the elderly. The pathological 
intracellular accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated Tau proteins, forming 
neurofibrillary tangles, and extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, forming 
senile plaques, as well as neural disconnection, neural death and synaptic 
dysfunction in the brain, are hallmark pathologies that characterize AD. The 
prevalence of the disease continues to increase globally due to the increase in 
longevity, quality of life, and medical treatment for chronic diseases that 
decreases the mortality and enhance the survival of elderly. Medical awareness 
and the accurate diagnosis of the disease also contribute to the high prevalence 
observed globally. Unfortunately, no definitive treatment exists that can be 
used to modify the course of AD, and no available treatment is capable of 
mitigating the cognitive decline or reversing the pathology of the disease as of 
yet. A plethora of hypotheses, ranging from the cholinergic theory and dominant 
Aβ cascade hypothesis to the abnormally excessive phosphorylated Tau protein 
hypothesis, have been reported. Various explanations for the pathogenesis of AD, 
such as the abnormal excitation of the glutamate system and mitochondrial 
dysfunction, have also been suggested. Despite the continuous efforts to deliver 
significant benefits and an effective treatment for this distressing, globally 
attested aging illness, multipronged approaches and strategies for ameliorating 
the disease course based on knowledge of the underpinnings of the pathogenesis 
of AD are urgently needed. Immunosenescence is an immune deficit process that 
appears with age (inflammaging process) and encompasses the remodeling of the 
lymphoid organs, leading to alterations in the immune function and 
neuroinflammation during advanced aging, which is closely linked to the 
outgrowth of infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignant cancers. It is well 
known that long-standing inflammation negatively influences the brain over the 
course of a lifetime due to the senescence of the immune system. Herein, we aim 
to trace the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, we 
explore alternative avenues, such as neuroimmune involvement in the pathogenesis 
of AD. We determine the initial triggers of neuroinflammation, which is an early 
episode in the pre-symptomatic stages of AD and contributes to the advancement 
of the disease, and the underlying key mechanisms of brain damage that might aid 
in the development of therapeutic strategies that can be used to combat this 
devastating disease. In addition, we aim to outline the ways in which different 
aspects of the immune system, both in the brain and peripherally, behave and 
thus to contribute to AD."
30,"The enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) is a crucial 
phenomenon for understanding the pathophysiological characteristics of blood 
vasculature and microenvironments in solid tumors. It is also an essential 
concept for designing anticancer drugs that can be selectively delivered into 
tumor tissue via the unique extravasation and retention mechanism for 
macromolecular drugs. As tumor vasculature is highly heterogeneous, the 
intensities of the EPR effect vary according to the types and locations of solid 
tumors in different species. However, the EPR effect is universally observed in 
a broad spectrum of solid tumors in human cancer as well as experimental animal 
tumor models. The matter is how to utilize the EPR effect for drug design and 
clinical application. Many hypotheses were proposed and tested to enhance the 
EPR effect in solid tumors in order to increase the efficacy of drug delivery. 
However, we should focus on increasing the blood flow in tumors so that more 
drugs can be perfused and accumulated inside tumor tissue and execute anticancer 
activities. Angiotensin II co-administration and the approach of intratumor 
arterial infusion should be considered to achieve selective tumor tissue 
perfusion for nanodrugs."
31,"In this review, we aim to discuss the use and effect of five different drugs 
used in the induction of anesthesia in cancer patients. Propofol, fentanyl, 
rocuronium, sugammadex, and dexamethasone are commonly used to induce anesthesia 
and prevent pain during surgery. Currently, the mechanisms of these drugs to 
induce the state of anesthesia are not yet fully understood, despite their use 
being considered safe. An association between anesthetic agents and cancer 
progression has been determined; therefore, it is essential to recognize the 
effects of all agents during cancer treatment and to evaluate whether the 
treatment provided to the patients could be more precise. We also highlight the 
use of in silico tools to review drug interaction effects and safety, as well as 
the efficacy of the treatment used according to different subgroups of patients."
32,"BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most prevalent type of 
lymphoma that is potentially curable by chemotherapy. Immunogenic cell death 
(ICD) is regarded as an essential process for the clearance of residual tumor 
cells. However, the impact of ICD on DLBCL remains unknown. Here, we tried to 
explore the prognostic role of ICD in DLBCL.
METHODS: A gene expression microarray of DLBCL was downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO). The genes involved in ICD were obtained via literature 
reviews. Then, based on univariate, multivariate, and LASSO Cox regression 
analysis, the ICD-related gene signature was identified. The effect of the 
ICD-related gene signature on DLBCL was explored. The chi-square test was used 
to compare complete response rate (CRR) and recurrence rate between high- and 
low-risk groups.
RESULTS: The signature based on 12 ICD-related genes could independently predict 
the overall survival of DLBCL. Furthermore, high risk was linked to lower CRR 
and higher recurrence rate. Then, a nomogram based on the ICD-related gene 
signature was established. The area under the curve of the prediction model 
reached 0.820 in the training set and 0.780 in the validation set.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the ICD-related gene signature could be a 
novel prognostic indicator for DLCBL."
33,"Hepatic fibrosis (HF) is a major cause of liver-related disorders and together 
with cancer-associated fibroblasts can favor liver cancer development by 
modulating the tumor microenvironment. Advanced HF, characterized by an excess 
of extracellular matrix (ECM), is mediated by TGF- β1, that activates hepatic 
stellate cells (HSCs) and fibroblasts. A TGF-β1 receptor inhibitor, LY2157299 or 
Galunisertib (GLY), has shown promising results against chronic liver 
progression in animal models, and we show that it can be further improved by 
enhancing GLYs bioavailability through encapsulation in polymeric 
polygalacturonic-polyacrylic acid nanomicelles (GLY-NMs). GLY-NMs reduced HF in 
an in vivo rat model of liver fibrosis induced by intraperitoneal injection of 
CCl4 as shown by the morphological, biochemical, and molecular biology 
parameters of normal and fibrotic livers. Moreover, GLY-NM was able to induce 
recovery from HF better than free GLY. Indeed, the encapsulated drug reduces 
collagen deposition, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation, prevents fatty 
degeneration and restores the correct lobular architecture of the liver as well 
as normalizes the serum parameters and expression of the genes involved in the 
onset of HF. In summary, GLY-NM improved the pharmacological activity of the 
free TGF- β1 inhibitor in the in vivo HF treatment and thus is a candidate as a 
novel therapeutic strategy."
34,"Even though rotational intraperitoneal pressurized aerosol chemotherapy (RIPAC) 
has been developed to improve the distribution and penetration depth of 
anti-cancer agents by pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC), 
the optimal nozzle position and patient's posture have not been investigated. 
Thus, we used nine pigs weighing 50-60 kg, and sprayed 150 mL of 1% methylene 
blue as an aerosol through the nozzle, DreamPen® (Dreampac Corp., Wonju, 
Republic of Korea), with a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min under a pressure of 140 to 
150 psi for RIPAC in six and three pigs with supine and Trendelenburg positions, 
respectively. When we evaluated its distribution and penetration depth, even 
distribution among 13 regions of the abdomen was observed in three pigs with 
Trendelenburg position regardless of the depth of the nozzle. Regarding 
penetration depth, the numbers of regions with maximal penetration depth were 
high in the 2 cm depth of the nozzle with supine position (n = 5) and the 4 cm 
depth with Trendelenburg position (n = 3). Conclusively, even distribution and 
maximal penetration of anti-cancer agents can be expected during RIPAC in the 
medium depth (4 cm) between the nozzle inlet and the visceral peritoneum located 
on the opposite side of it and the Trendelenburg position."
35,"The approval of larotrectinib and entrectinib for cancer patients harboring an 
NTRK gene fusion has represented a milestone in the era of ""histology-agnostic"" 
drugs. Among the clinical trials that led to the approval of these two drugs, 
most of the enrolled patients were affected by soft tissue sarcomas, lung, and 
salivary gland cancer. However, as next-generation sequencing assays are 
increasingly available in the clinical setting, health care professionals may be 
able to detect NTRK gene fusions in patients affected by tumor types under or 
not represented in the clinical trials. To this aim, we systematically reviewed 
MEDLINE from its inception to 31 August 2022 for case reports and case series on 
patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive tumors treated with TRK inhibitors. A 
virtual cohort of 43 patients was created, excluding those enrolled in the 
above-mentioned clinical trials. Although our results align with those existing 
in the literature, various cases of central nervous system tumors were 
registered in our cohort, confirming the benefit of these agents in this 
subgroup of patients. Large, multi-institutional registries are needed to 
provide more information about the efficacy of TRK inhibitors in cancer patients 
affected by tumor types under or not represented in the clinical trials."
36,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment 
for many patients suffering from hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, inborn 
errors of metabolism or genetic disorders. Despite decades of successful HSCT, 
clinical outcomes are still far from satisfactory due to treatment-related 
complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and cardiovascular 
complications (CVC). CVC may affect patients in the acute period post-HSCT; 
however, the occurrence is far higher among long-term survivors. Induction 
treatment using cardiotoxic treatments, e.g., anthracyclines and radiotherapy, 
conditioning regimens containing cyclophosphamide, and post-HSCT comorbidities, 
including GvHD, are factors contributing to CVC. Cardiac function evaluation 
prior to and post-transplantation is an important strategy for choosing the 
proper conditioning regimen, HSCT protocol and post-HSCT supportive care. 
Cardiac systolic function evaluation by echocardiography, in addition to serum 
cardiac biomarkers, such as troponins and brain natriuretic peptides, is 
recommended as a routine follow-up for HSCT patients. Angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-II-receptor blockers, and beta-blockers, which 
are mostly used for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, might 
be used as treatments for HSCT-related CVC. In summary, the present review 
reveals the urgent need for further investigations concerning HSCT-related CVC 
both at the preclinical and clinical levels due to the lack of knowledge about 
CVC and its underlying mechanisms."
37,"The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway plays a key role in cancer, 
influencing growth, proliferation, and survival of tumor cells. PIK3CA mutations 
are generally oncogenic and responsible for uncontrolled cellular growth. PI3K 
inhibitors (PI3Ki) can inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, although burdened by 
not easily manageable toxicity. Among PI3Ki, alpelisib, a selective p110α 
inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2- PIK3CA 
mutant metastatic breast cancer (BC) that has progressed to a first line 
endocrine therapy. PIK3CA mutations are also present in triple negative BC 
(TNBC) and HER2+ BC, although the role of PI3K inhibition is not well 
established in these subtypes. In this review, we go through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
pathway, describing most common mutations found in PI3K genes and how they can 
be detected. We describe the available biological and clinical evidence of 
PIK3CA mutations in breast cancers other than HR+/HER2-, summarizing clinical 
trials investigating PI3Ki in these subtypes."
38,"Reproductive genetic carrier screening (RGCS) provides people with information 
about their chance of having children with autosomal recessive or X-linked 
genetic conditions, enabling informed reproductive decision-making. RGCS is 
recommended to be offered to all couples during preconception or in early 
pregnancy. However, cost and a lack of awareness may prevent access. To address 
this, the Australian Government funded Mackenzie's Mission-the Australian 
Reproductive Genetic Carrier Screening Project. Mackenzie's Mission aims to 
assess the acceptability and feasibility of an easily accessible RGCS program, 
provided free of charge to the participant. In study Phase 1, implementation 
needs were mapped, and key study elements were developed. In Phase 2, RGCS is 
being offered by healthcare providers educated by the study team. Reproductive 
couples who provide consent are screened for over 1200 genes associated with 
&gt;750 serious, childhood-onset genetic conditions. Those with an increased 
chance result are provided comprehensive genetic counseling support. 
Reproductive couples, recruiting healthcare providers, and study team members 
are also invited to complete surveys and/or interviews. In Phase 3, a 
mixed-methods analysis will be undertaken to assess the program outcomes, 
psychosocial implications and implementation considerations alongside an ongoing 
bioethical analysis and a health economic evaluation. Findings will inform the 
implementation of an ethically robust RGCS program."
39,"BACKGROUND: Uterine canceris one of the most common pelvic tumors in females. 
Advanced stage uterine cancer only represents 15% of newly diagnosed cases; 
however, they are related with poor prognosis. Our aim was to analyze the 
benefits of cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy 
in peritoneal carcinomatosis due to uterine cancer.
METHODS: At the Istanbul Umraniye Training and Research Hospital, Surgical 
Oncology Clinic, morbidity, overall survival and survival without progression 
were analyzed over the 5-year follow up. Twenty-two cases who had undergone 
cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy due to 
uterine-peritoneal carcinomatosis were included in this study. Cases were 
followed up in terms of postoperative morbidity-mortality, disease-free survival 
and overall survival. The cut off value for the peritoneal carcinomatosis index 
score was set at 15. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and 
doxorubicin was applied to all patients for 60 min after the suturation of the 
abdomen.
RESULTS: Median age of the patients was 64.6 (43-72). Average PCI score was 12.8 
(3-15). CC score was 0 in 16 (72.7%) cases, 1 in 3 cases and 2 in 3 cases. Of 
these patients, 12 of them were previously operated upon. Median stay at the 
hospital was 13.1 days. No major complications due to chemotherapy were 
reported. A Clavien-Dindo Grade 3 complication was observed in seven (31.8%) 
patients. Mortality was not observed in patients during their stay at the 
hospital. The 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 36.8 
(36%) months and 45.3 (57%) months, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We think that due to longer disease-free survival and overall 
survival, cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy 
should be preferred in peritoneal carcinomatosis due to uterine cancer patients 
having low peritoneal carcinomatosis index scores and manageable complication 
rates. However, prospective randomizedtrials with a high number of cases are 
needed for this subject."
40,"BACKGROUND: Women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), WLWHs, are at 
high risk of developing anal cancer associated with high-risk human papilloma 
virus infection (HR-HPV). We analyzed the prevalence of anal HR-HPV infection 
and abnormal anal cytology in a cohort of WLWHs and assessed the risk factors 
for anal HR-HPV infection.
METHODS: We present a single-center, observational cross-sectional study. WLWHs 
who underwent anal cytology and anal human papilloma virus (HPV) testing were 
selected. High-resolution anoscopy was performed in cases of abnormal anal 
cytology. All suspicious lesions were biopsied. A univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression model was used to analyze risk factors for abnormal anal 
screening. The results are presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: In total, 400 WLWHs were studied. Of them, 334 met the eligibility 
criteria and were enrolled in the study. Abnormal anal cytology was detected in 
39.5% of patients, and anal HR-HPV in 40.1%, with HPV 16 in 33 (26.6%) of them. 
Concomitant HR-HPV cervical infection was the only independent risk factor for 
HR-HPV anal infection (OR 1.67 95% CI, p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: WLWHs have a high prevalence of HR-HPV anal infection and anal 
cytologic abnormalities. HR-HPV cervical infection is the main predictor of 
HR-HPV anal infection."
41,"Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction has become an important strategy for tumor 
therapy, which has shown outstanding therapeutic effects in clinical settings. 
However, unsatisfactory response rates and immune-related adverse effects limit 
the use of anti-PD1/PD-L1 antibodies. Here, we report the discovery and 
identification of S4-1, an innovative small-molecule inhibitor of PD-L1. In 
vitro, S4-1 effectively altered the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction, induced PD-L1 
dimerization and internalization, improved its localization to endoplasmic 
reticulum, and thus enhanced the cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells toward tumor cells. In vivo, S4-1 significantly inhibited tumor growth in 
both lung and colorectal cancer models, particularly in colorectal cancer, where 
it led to complete clearance of a portion of the tumor cells. Furthermore, S4-1 
induced T-cell activation and inversed the inhibitory tumor microenvironment, 
consistent with the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway blockade. These data support the 
continued evaluation of S4-1 as an alternative ICB therapeutic strategy."
42,"BACKGROUND: A high pre-treatment De Ritis ratio, the aspartate 
transaminase/alanine aminotransferase ratio, has been suggested to be of 
prognostic value for mortality in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Our 
purpose was to evaluate if a high ratio was associated with mortality and 
downstaging.
METHODS: A total of 347 Swedish patients with clinically staged T2-T4aN0M0, with 
administered neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) or eligible for NAC and undergoing 
radical cystectomy (RC) 2009-2021, were retrospectively evaluated with a low 
ratio &lt; 1.3 vs. high ratio &gt; 1.3, by Log Rank test, Cox regression and 
Mann-Whitney U-test (MWU), SPSS 27.
RESULTS: Patients with a high ratio had a decrease of up to 3 years in 
disease-free survival (DFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival 
(OS) (p = 0.009, p = 0.004 and p = 0.009) and 5 years in CSS and OS (p = 0.019 
and p = 0.046). A high ratio was associated with increased risk of mortality, 
highest in DFS (HR, 1.909; 95% CI, 1.265-2.880; p = 0.002). No significant 
relationship between downstaging and a high ratio existed (p = 0.564 MWU).
CONCLUSION: A high pre-treatment De Ritis ratio is on a population level, 
associated with increased mortality post-RC in endpoints DFS, CSS and OS. 
Associations decrease over time and require further investigations to determine 
how strong the associations are as meaningful prognostic markers for long-term 
mortality in MIBC. The ratio is not suitable for downstaging-prediction."
43,"To perform robotic lung resections with views similar to those in thoracotomy, 
we devised a vertical port placement and confronting upside-down monitor 
setting: the three-arm, robotic ""open-thoracotomy-view approach (OTVA)"". We 
described the robotic OTVA experiences focusing on segmentectomy and its 
technical aspects. We retrospectively reviewed 114 consecutive patients who 
underwent robotic lung resections (76 lobectomies and 38 segmentectomies) with 
OTVA using the da Vinci Xi Surgical System between February 2019 and June 2022. 
To identify segmental boundaries, we administered indocyanine green 
intravenously and used the robotic fluorescence imaging system (Firefly). In all 
procedures, cranial-side intrathoracic structures, which are often hidden in the 
conventional look-up-view method, were well visualized. The mean durations of 
surgery and console operation were 195 and 140 min, respectively, and 225 and 
173 min, for segmentectomy and lobectomy, respectively. In segmentectomy, 
console operation was significantly shorter (approximately 30 min, p &lt; 0.001) 
and two more staplers (8.2 ± 2.3) were used compared with lobectomy (6.6 ± 2.6, 
p = 0.003). In both groups, median postoperative durations of chest tube 
placement and hospitalization were 0 and 3 days, respectively. This three-arm 
robotic OTVA setting offers natural thoracotomy views and can be an alternative 
for segmentectomy and lobectomy."
44,"Over the past 50 years, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has played a critical role in the 
systemic chemotherapy of cancer patients. Bolus intravenous (IV) 5-FU infusion 
has been used due to the limitation of its extremely short half-life 
(10-15 min). This study used ultrasound (US) mediating 5-FU-loaded microbubbles 
(MBs) cavitation as a tool to increase local intratumoral 5-FU levels with a 
reduced dose of 5-FU (a single IV injection of 2.5 mg/kg instead of a single 
intraperitoneal injection of 25-200 mg/kg as used in previous studies in mice). 
The 5-FU-MBs were prepared with a 132 mg/mL albumin solution and a 0.30 mg/mL 
5-FU solution. The diameters of the MBs and 5-FU-MBs were 1.24 ± 0.85 and 
2.00 ± 0.53 µm (mean ± SEM), respectively, and the maximum loading efficiency of 
5-FU on MBs was 19.04 ± 0.25%. In the in vitro study, the cell viabilities of 
5-FU and 5-FU-MBs did not differ significantly, but compared with the 5-FU-MBs 
treatment-alone group, cell toxicity increased to 31% in the 5-FU-MBs + US group 
(p < 0.001). The biodistribution results indicated that the 5-FU levels of the 
tumors in small animals were significant higher for the 5-FU-MBs + US treatment 
than for either the 5-FU-MBs or 5-FU treatment with low 5-FU systemic treatment 
doses (2.5 mg/kg 5-FU IV). In small-animal treatment, 2.5 mg/kg 5-FU therapeutic 
IV doses injected into mice caused a more-significant reduction in tumor growth 
in the 5-FU-MBs + US group (65.9%) than in the control group after 34 days of 
treatment."
45,"PURPOSE: To validate the association between body composition and mortality in 
men treated with radiation for localized prostate cancer (PCa). Secondarily, to 
integrate body composition as a factor to classify patients by risk of all-cause 
mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants of NRG/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 
(RTOG) 9406 and NRG/RTOG 0126 with archived computed tomography were included. 
Muscle mass and muscle density were estimated by measuring the area and 
attenuation of the psoas muscles on a single slice at L4-L5. Bone density was 
estimated by measuring the attenuation of the vertebral body at mid-L5. Survival 
analyses, including Cox proportional hazards models, assessed the relationship 
between body composition and mortality. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) 
was used to create a classification tree to classify participants by risk of 
death.
RESULTS: Data from 2066 men were included in this study. In the final 
multivariable model, psoas area, comorbidity score, baseline prostate serum 
antigen, and age were significantly associated with survival. The RPA yielded a 
classification tree with four prognostic groups determined by age, comorbidity, 
and psoas area. Notably, the classification among older (≥70 years) men into 
prognostic groups was determined by psoas area.
CONCLUSIONS: This study strongly supports that body composition is related to 
mortality in men with localized PCa. The inclusion of psoas area in the RPA 
classification tree suggests that body composition provides additive information 
to age and comorbidity status for mortality prediction, particularly among older 
men. More research is needed to determine the clinical impact of body 
composition on prognostic models in men with PCa."
46,"Macrophages, critical components of bone marrow microenvironment, are reported 
to be remodeled into leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs) in leukemic 
microenvironment where they contribute to leukemia development, characterized as 
M2 macrophages with pro-tumor effects. However, how leukemic microenvironment 
transforms macrophages into LAMs remains unknown. Here, we analyzed the clinical 
relevance of LAMs and profiled their RNA-Seq from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
patients with complete remission (CR) after induction treatment and refractory 
AML patients. Our results showed that the proportion and number of LAMs in 
refractory AML patients was higher than that in CR patients and LAM was a poor 
prognostic factor of AML patients. Furthermore, let-7b was a potentially 
aberrant gene in LAMs contributed to M2-subtype characteristics. Knockdown of 
let-7b in LAMs could inhibit the development of AML by repolarizing LAMs towards 
M1-subtype characteristics through the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 
and NF-κB pathway. Our study provides insight for future LAM-based immunotherapy 
strategies for AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
47,"Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) integrates both immunological and 
non-immunological inputs to control cell survival and death. Small GTPases are 
versatile functional switches that lie on the very upstream in signal 
transduction pathways, of which duration of activation is very transient. The 
large number of homologous proteins and the requirement for site-directed 
mutagenesis have hindered attempts to investigate the link between small GTPases 
and IRF3. Here, we constructed a constitutively active mutant expression library 
for small GTPase expression using Gibson assembly cloning. Small-scale screening 
identified multiple GTPases capable of promoting IRF3 phosphorylation. 
Intriguingly, 27 of 152 GTPases, including ARF1, RHEB, RHEBL1, and RAN, were 
found to increase IRF3 phosphorylation. Unbiased screening enabled us to 
investigate the sequence-activity relationship between the GTPases and IRF3. We 
found that the regulation of IRF3 by small GTPases was dependent on TBK1. Our 
work reveals the significant contribution of GTPases in IRF3 signaling and the 
potential role of IRF3 in GTPase function, providing a novel therapeutic 
approach against diseases with GTPase overexpression or active mutations, such 
as cancer."
48,"Autophagy is a process of eliminating damaged or unnecessary proteins and 
organelles, thereby maintaining intracellular homeostasis. Deregulation of 
autophagy is associated with several diseases including cancer. Contradictory 
dual roles of autophagy have been well established in cancer. Cytoprotective 
mechanism of autophagy has been extensively investigated for overcoming 
resistance to cancer therapies including radiotherapy, targeted therapy, 
immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. Selective autophagy inhibitors that directly 
target autophagic process have been developed for cancer treatment. Efficacies 
of autophagy inhibitors have been tested in various pre-clinical cancer animal 
models. Combination therapies of autophagy inhibitors with chemotherapeutics are 
being evaluated in clinal trials. In this review, we will focus on genetical and 
pharmacological perturbations of autophagy-related proteins in different steps 
of autophagic process and their therapeutic benefits. We will also summarize 
combination therapies of autophagy inhibitors with chemotherapies and their 
outcomes in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Understanding of current 
knowledge of development, progress, and application of cytoprotective autophagy 
inhibitors in combination therapies will open new possibilities for overcoming 
drug resistance and improving clinical outcomes."
49,"Radiation-induced intestinal injury (RIII) is a common complication after 
radiation therapy in patients with pelvic, abdominal, or retroperitoneal 
tumours. Recently, in the model of DSS (Dextran Sulfate Sodium Salt) -induced 
intestinal inflammatory injury, it has been found in the study that transgenic 
mice expressing hVDR in IEC (Intestinal Epithelial Cell) manifest highly 
anti-injury properties in colitis, suggesting that activated VDR in the 
epithelial cells of intestine may inhibit colitis by protecting the mucosal 
epithelial barrier. In this study, we investigated the effect of the expression 
and regulation of VDR on the protection of RIII, and the radiosensitivity in 
vitro experiments, and explored the initial mechanism of VDR in regulating 
radiosensitivity of IEC. As a result, we found that the expression of VDR in 
intestinal tissues and cells in mice can be induced by ionizing radiation. VDR 
agonists are able to prolong the average survival time of mice after radiation 
and reduce the radiation-induced intestinal injury. For lack of vitamin D, the 
radiosensitivity of intestinal epithelial cells in mice increased, which can be 
reduced by VDR activation. Ensuing VDR activation, the radiation-induced 
intestinal stem cells damage is decreased, and the regeneration and 
differentiation of intestinal stem cells is promoted as well. Finally, on the 
basis of sequencing analysis, we validated and found that VDR may target the 
HIF/PDK1 pathway to mitigate RIII. We concluded that agonism or upregulation of 
VDR expression attenuates radiation-induced intestinal damage in mice and 
promotes the repair of epithelial damage in intestinal stem cells."
50,"The somatic hypermutation (SHM) status of the clonotypic, rearranged 
immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene is an established prognostic and 
predictive marker in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Analysis of SHM is 
generally performed by PCR-amplification of clonal IGHV-IGHDIGHJ gene 
rearrangements followed by sequencing to identify IGHV gene sequences and 
germline identity. Targeted-hybridisation next-generation sequencing (NGS) can 
simultaneously assess clonality and other genetic aberrations, however it has 
limitations for SHM analysis due to sequence similarity between different IGHV 
genes and mutations introduced by SHM, which can affect alignment efficiency and 
accuracy. We have developed a novel SHM assessment strategy using a 
targeted-hybridisation NGS approach (EuroClonality-NDC assay) and applied it to 
331 samples of lymphoproliferative disorder (LPDs). Our strategy focuses on 
analysing the sequence downstream to the clonotypic, rearranged IGHJ gene up to 
the IGHM enhancer (IGHJ-E) which provides more accurate alignment. Overall, 
84/95 (88.4%) CLL cases with conventional SHM data showed concordant SHM status, 
increasing to 91.6% when excluding borderline cases. Additionally, IGHJ-E 
mutation analysis in a wide range of pre- and post-germinal centre LPD showed 
significant correlation with differentiation and lineage status, suggesting that 
IGHJ-E analysis is a promising surrogate marker enabling SHM to be reported 
using NGS-capture strategies and whole genome sequencing."
51,"Imidazole (IM) and salicylic acid (SA) have a significant class among the 
medical compound. These are widely used as topical drugs like antifungal, 
antibacterial, anticancer, immunosuppressive agent, etc. These two bioactive 
organic moieties are combined by a weak hydrogen bond formed by hydrogen 
transfer. The charge transfer (CT) complex of acceptor (SA) and donor (IM), has 
been synthesized at room temperature in methanol and confirmed by signal-crystal 
XRD, conductance and UV-visible spectroscopy. The X-ray crystallography provides 
the original structural information of CT complex and displays the existence of 
N+-H--O- bond between IM and SA. The physical properties such as (ECT), (RN), 
(ID), (f), (D) and (Δ G0) along with molar extinction coefficient (εCT) and 
formation constant (KCT) were estimated through UV-visible spectroscopy. Job's 
method and Benesi-Hildebrand equation suggested 1:1 stoichiometry of 
([IM]+[SA]-). The results indicate a complete transfer of hydrogen atom and CT 
complex formation with 1:1 molar ratio of IM and SA. Antimicrobial activity was 
veiled against different bacteria like Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and 
Staphylococcus aureus; and different fungi as Fusarium oxysporum, Candida 
albicans and Aspergillus niger by disc diffusion method. CT complex was also 
tested for cytotoxic activity against lung cancer cell lines in comparison to 
breast cancer cell lines. Molecular docking provides the information of binding 
of [(IM)+(SA)-] with the cancer marker (1M17), which has substantial application 
for drug designing. The investigational studies were supplemented through 
time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) using basis set 
B3LYP/6-311G**. Through DFT calculations, HOMO→LUMO electronic energy gap (ΔE) 
was obtained."
52,"Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) is an exceptionally rare type of breast carcinoma 
with a low-grade morphology and a favorable prognosis. It is postulated to be a 
type of invasive carcinoma arising in microglandular adenosis (MGA). We report a 
case of extensively spreading ACC of the breast with MGA-like features. 
Macroscopically, yellowish nodules were widely distributed throughout the right 
breast, up to the axilla, without mass formation. Microscopically, the tumor 
consisted of two distinct carcinoma components: one was multiple nodular lesions 
showing invasive carcinoma with fused solid nests, and the other was a widely 
spreading lesion exhibiting MGA-like features with uniform small single glands. 
Immunohistochemically, both components were negative for ER, PR, and HER2, and 
expressed EMA, S100 and lysozyme. The distinct morphology and molecular 
expression indicated ACC. The single glands in the MGA-like area lacked 
myoepithelial cells but were linearly surrounded by type IV collagen, a basement 
membrane component. This case supports the hypothesis that ACC and MGA have the 
same lineage and indicates that ACC is not necessarily a low-grade malignancy 
and can be aggressive."
53,"The innate immune system protects the host from external pathogens and internal 
damage in various ways. The cGAS-STING signaling pathway, comprised of cyclic 
GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes (STING), and downstream 
signaling adaptors, plays an essential role in protective immune defense against 
microbial DNA and internal damaged-associated DNA and is responsible for various 
immune-related diseases. After binding with DNA, cytosolic cGAS undergoes 
conformational change and DNA-linked liquid-liquid phase separation to produce 
2'3'-cGAMP for the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized STING. 
However, further studies revealed that cGAS is predominantly expressed in the 
nucleus and strictly tethered to chromatin to prevent binding with nuclear DNA, 
and functions differently from cytosolic-localized cGAS. Detailed delineation of 
this pathway, including its structure, signaling, and regulatory mechanisms, is 
of great significance to fully understand the diversity of cGAS-STING activation 
and signaling and will be of benefit for the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
and cancer. Here, we review recent progress on the above-mentioned perspectives 
of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and discuss new avenues for further study."
54,"OBJECTIVE: Despite successful endovascular therapy, a proportion of stroke 
patients exhibit long-term functional decline, regardless of the cortical 
reperfusion. Our objective was to evaluate the early activation of the adaptive 
immune response and its impact on neurological recovery in patients with large 
vessel occlusion (LVO).
METHODS: Nineteen (13 females, 6 males) patients with acute LVO were enrolled in 
a single-arm prospective cohort study. During endovascular therapy (EVT), blood 
samples were collected from pre and post-occlusion, distal femoral artery, and 
median cubital vein (controls). Cytokines, chemokines, cellular and functional 
profiles were evaluated with immediate and follow-up clinical and radiographic 
parameters, including cognitive performance and functional recovery.
RESULTS: In the hyperacute phase (within hours), adaptive immune activation was 
observed in the post-occlusion intra-arterial environment (post). Ischemic 
vascular tissue had a significant increase in T-cell-related cytokines, 
including IFN-γ and MMP-9, while GM-CSF, IL-17, TNF-α, IL-6, MIP-1a, and MIP-1b 
were decreased. Cellularity analysis revealed an increase in inflammatory IL-17+ 
and GM-CSF+ helper T-cells, while natural killer (NK), monocytes and B-cells 
were decreased. A correlation was observed between hypoperfused tissue, infarct 
volume, inflammatory helper, and cytotoxic T-cells. Moreover, helper and 
cytotoxic T-cells were also significantly increased in patients with improved 
motor function at 3 months.
INTERPRETATION: We provide evidence of the activation of the inflammatory 
adaptive immune response during the hyperacute phase and the association of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines with greater ischemic tissue and worsening recovery 
after successful reperfusion. Further characterization of these immune pathways 
is warranted to test selective immunomodulators during the early stages of 
stroke rehabilitation."
55,"BACKGROUND: The mechanism of metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma 
transcript 1 (Malat1) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is still unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-141-3p and Malat1 in 
autophagy in TNBC under hypoxia.
METHOD: The expression levels of Malat1 and miR-141-3p were detected via 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The protein 
expression levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), HIF-2α, MMP9, p62 and 
LC3 were determined via western blotting. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used 
to detect cell viability, while a Transwell assay to detect cell proliferation 
and invasion. A luciferase assay was used to confirm the relationship between 
Malat1 and miR-141-3p.
RESULTS: A significant increase was observed in the expression level of Malat1 
and the autophagic activity in TNBC tissues and cells. The expression level of 
Malat1 was higher in a hypoxic environment, which can significantly promote the 
proliferation, migration, and invasion of TNBC cells by activating autophagy. 
HIF-1α, but not HIF-2α, was identified to induce the upregulation of Malat1 in 
TNBC cells. The dual-luciferase assay results identified a miR-141-binding site 
in Malat1. Malat1 knockdown and miR-141-3p overexpression were demonstrated to 
significantly inhibit autophagy, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation, 
invasion, and migration. Moreover, hypoxia can inhibit the effect of miR-141-3p 
on TNBC cells.
CONCLUSION: miR-141-3p could suppress autophagy and inhibit proliferation, 
migration, and invasion by targeting Malat1 in TNBC cells under hypoxia. The 
existence of the HIF-1α/Malat1/miR-141 axis plays a vital role in the 
development of TNBC and may be a target for the diagnosis and treatment of TNBC."
56,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, and its incidence 
is linearly associated with age. The development of cancer treatments has 
changed the prognosis of this disease. Despite effective treatments, 
cardiovascular complications in middle-aged and older women have become 
challenging. Physical exercise is a powerful tool to prevent senescence symptoms 
and diseases, besides being an essential component for cardiovascular diseases 
and cancer prevention and treatment. The present narrative review considers the 
vascular dysfunction associated with breast cancer treatment, specifically 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the effects of exercise on vascular toxicity. 
We also explored the mechanisms involved in these responses. The search strategy 
involved three databases (Pubmed, Scielo, and Web of Science) with the following 
descriptors: breast cancer, vascular toxicity, physical exercise, chemotherapy, 
and radiotherapy. The evidence showed that breast cancer patients, especially 
those under chemotherapy and over 50 years old, have a potential risk of 
developing vascular dysfunction, which may persist in the long term. Decreases 
in nitric oxide bioavailability and increases in oxidative stress and 
pro-inflammatory cytokines might mediate the chemotherapy and 
radiotherapy-induced vascular dysfunction. Exercise seems to be a promising 
strategy for managing this risk. However, there is a need for well-constructed 
studies evaluating vascular toxicity in breast cancer, especially in middle-aged 
and elderly patients, to establish whether exercise is beneficial."
57,"AIMS: Breast phyllodes tumours (PT) are a rare subset of fibroepithelial 
neoplasms categorised into benign, borderline, and malignant grades according to 
the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours (WCTs). In this 
report, we developed an evidence gap map (EGM) based on literature cited in the 
PT chapter of the 5th edition of the breast WCT in order to identify knowledge 
and research gaps in PT.
METHODS: A framework was first established where the dimensions of the EGM were 
defined as categories of tumour descriptors, tumour types and evidence levels. 
Citations were collected into a Microsoft Excel® form and imported into 
EPPI-reviewer to produce the EGM.
RESULTS: The EGM showed that ""Histopathology"" and ""Pathogenesis"" sections 
contained the most citations, the majority being of low-level evidence. The 
highest number of citations considered of moderate-level evidence were found in 
the ""Histopathology"" section. There was no high-level evidence cited in this 
chapter. ""Localization"", ""Etiology"" and ""Staging"" sections had the fewest 
citations.
CONCLUSIONS: This EGM provides a visual representation of cited literature in 
the PT chapter of the breast WCT, revealing the lack of high-level evidence 
citations. There is an uneven distribution of references, probably due to 
citation practices. Pockets of low-level evidence are highlighted, possibly 
related to referencing habits, lack of relevant research, or belief that the 
information presented is standard accepted fact without need for specific 
citations. Future work needs to bridge evidence gaps and broaden citations 
beyond those in the latest WCT."
58,"Single-cell sequencing has scientific impacts on better understanding the 
immunity. There is a rapid development in single cell-based databases and 
analytic tools to provide the potential of clinical and translational discovery. 
The understanding of single-cell based immunity needs a strong program and solid 
evidence of preclinical and clinical validation and evaluation. The current 
special topic issue on single cell and immunity aimed to provide a strong 
communication for the progress of single cell-based studies on immune cell 
functional diversity in development and disease. The topic has a clear scope on 
the application of single cell sequencing to better understand immune cell 
heterogeneities, functions, cell-cell interactions, responses and regulatory 
roles in systems immunology and diseases."
59,"AIM: The primary aim of the study is to describe the variation in the operative 
and non-operative management of emergency presentations of colon and rectal 
cancer in an international cohort. Secondary aims will be to develop a risk 
prediction model for mortality and primary anastomosis and validate risk 
criteria of large bowel obstruction in patients with previously known colorectal 
cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy or awaiting elective surgery.
METHOD: This prospective, multicentre audit will be conducted via the student- 
and trainee-led EuroSurg Collaborative network internationally over 2023 with 
90-day follow-up. Data will be collected on consecutive adult patients 
presenting to the hospital in an unplanned and urgent manner with colorectal 
cancer (CRC) due to malignant large bowel obstruction (LBO), perforation, 
CRC-related haemorrhage, or other related reasons. Primary outcome is 90-day 
mortality. Secondary outcomes include rates of stomas, primary anastomosis, 
stenting, preoperative imaging, and complications or readmissions.
CONCLUSION: This protocol describes the methodology for the first international 
audit on the management of acutely presenting CRC. This study will utilise a 
large collaborative network with robust data validation and assurance 
strategies. APOLLO will provide a comprehensive understanding of current 
practice, develop risk prediction tools in this setting, and validate existing 
trial results."
60,"AIMS: For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving neoadjuvant 
therapy, the major pathologic response (MPR) is defined as the percentage of 
residual viable tumor cells (%RVT) in the tumor bed of no more than 10%. It has 
been proposed as a predictor of survival in neoadjuvant therapy-treated cohorts. 
Nonetheless, the significance of %RVT in the pathological assessment of lung 
adenocarcinoma cohorts remains undetermined.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Overall, 152 lung adenocarcinoma patients were included in 
this retrospective study, among whom 67 received neoadjuvant targeted therapy 
and 85 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Clinicopathological characteristics, 
neoadjuvant treatment response, and survival status were investigated. The 
routinely adopted standard for MPR (%RVT ≤10%) failed to differentiate prognosis 
in the lung adenocarcinoma population. For the neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort, 
the optimal %RVT cutoff value of RFS was 60%. However, this cutoff value was 
clinically insignificant in the neoadjuvant targeted therapy cohort. Hence, for 
these patients, we built a nomogram model including high-grade patterns and ypN 
stage to predict disease recurrence, demonstrating a high efficacy (a 
bootstrap-corrected C-index of 0.731).
CONCLUSIONS: %RVT served as a strong indicator of the prognosis of lung 
adenocarcinoma in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy but not 
neoadjuvant targeted therapy. Residual high-grade pathological patterns might 
substitute MPR in prognostic evaluation of lung adenocarcinoma post-targeted 
therapy."
61,"OBJECTIVE: Patient delay was defined as an interval between the discovery of the 
initial symptoms and diagnosis, which was longer than 90 days. This study aimed 
to determine the patient delay rate and related factors in women with cervical 
cancer in Hunan province, South-Central China.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 140 women with cervical 
cancer aged <35 years from October, 2019 to March, 2021. Assumptions in Andersen 
Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization were used to measure the factors 
influencing patient delay. Logistic regression models were used to identify 
factors associated with patient delay. A P-value of <5% was considered 
significant.
RESULTS: A total of 57 (40.71%) young women with cervical cancer had patient 
delay, with an average delay time of 178.70 (307.90) days. Predisposing factors, 
such as religion, unemployment, health beliefs related to cancer screening, and 
a history of cervical cancer screening within 2 years or more (P ​< ​0.05), were 
associated with patient delay. Enabling factors, such as distance to the nearest 
medical facility and type of the nearest medical facility, were associated with 
a reduced likelihood of patient delay. With the need-for-care factor, young 
women who experienced vaginal pain after or during intercourse had a higher risk 
(adjusted odds ratio, 33.48; 95% confidence interval, 3.22-348.68, P ​= ​0.003) 
of patient delay.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce the need for programs to enhance knowledge 
and awareness about cervical cancer screening and the importance of early 
diagnosis in women to help eliminate cervical cancer in China by 2050."
62,"C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) is a cytosolic tyrosine-protein kinase with an 
important role in regulating critical cellular decisions, such as cellular 
apoptosis, survival, proliferation, cytoskeletal organization and many others. 
Current knowledge on the CSK mechanisms of action, regulation and functions is 
still at an early stage, most of CSK's known actions and functions being 
mediated by the negative regulation of the SRC family of tyrosine kinases (SFKs) 
through phosphorylation. As SFKs play a vital role in apoptosis, cell 
proliferation and survival regulation, SFK inhibition by CSK has a pro-apoptotic 
effect, which is mediated by the inhibition of cellular signaling cascades 
controlled by SFKs, such as the MAPK/ERK, STAT3 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. 
Abnormal functioning of CSK and SFK activation can lead to diseases such as 
cancer, cardiovascular and neurological manifestations. This review describes 
apoptosis regulation by CSK, CSK inhibition of the SFKs and further explores the 
clinical relevance of CSK in important pathologies, such as cancer, autoimmune, 
autoinflammatory, neurologic diseases, hypertension and HIV/AIDS."
63,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the common cancers in males and its 
incidence keeps increasing globally. Approximately 81% of PCa is diagnosed 
during the early stage of the disease. The treatment options for prostate care 
include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, but these treatments often have 
side effects that may lead to issues such as impotence or decreased bowel 
function. Our central goal is to test the apoptotic effects of Vernonia 
amygdalina Delile (an edible medicinal plant that is relatively inexpensive, 
nontoxic, and virtually without side effects) for the prevention of PCa using 
human adenocarcinoma (PC-3) cells as a test model.
METHODS: To address our central goal, PC-3 cells were treated with Vernonia 
amygdalina Delile (VAD). Cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis were evaluated by 
Flow Cytometry assessment. Nucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected by agarose 
gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS: Flow cytometry data showed that VAD induced cell cycle arrest at the 
G0/G1 checkpoint and significantly upregulated caspase-3 in treated cells 
compared to the control cells. Agarose gel electrophoresis resulted in the 
formation of DNA ladders in VAD-treated cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that inhibition of cancer cell growth, 
induction of cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis through caspase-3 activation and 
nucleosomal DNA fragmentation are involved in the therapeutic mechanisms of VAD 
as a candidate drug towards the prevention and/or treatment of PCa."
64,"Although thrombocytopenia is common in end-stage liver disease, severe, 
refractory thrombocytopenia during liver transplantation is rare, and if immune 
based, usually presents months or years later. This case describes an adult 
woman in whom preoperative evaluation had not determined an immune-related cause 
of thrombocytopenia. Clot strength was dramatically impaired as measured by 
thrombelastography during the transplant. Following a lack of response to repeat 
platelet transfusions, splenectomy was performed after graft reperfusion with 
rapid temporal restoration of clot strength. This case shows a severe 
manifestation of perioperative thrombocytopenia during liver transplantation and 
clinically guided management when measured clot strength is too low for accurate 
determination."
65,"Due to low incidence, there are no large prospective studies or clinical trials 
for small cell carcinoma (SCC) of the genitourinary system (GU), and most data 
are extrapolated from SCC of the lung. Using the SEER database, we analyzed 
incidence trends, overall survival, and cancer-specific survival using the 
log-rank test. Analysis of variables was performed using the Cox proportional 
hazards regression model. The analysis showed that SCC of the bladder and 
prostate were the most common types of GU SCC, with 1836 and 606 cases, 
respectively. In 2018, the incidence of SCC of the bladder and prostate was 
twice that of 2010 (P < 0.001). The overall survival and cancer-specific 
survival of patients with SCC of the bladder were significantly longer than 
those of patients with SCC of the prostate (P < 0.0001). SCC bladder patients 
with advanced age, more extensive growth, lymph node involvement, no surgical 
intervention, and the presence of the metastasis had worse survival outcomes 
(P < 0.05). The Asian/Pacific Islander race provided some survival benefits for 
patients with SCC of the bladder (P < 0.05). For patients with SCC of the 
prostate, only advanced age was a risk factor for poor outcomes (P < 0.05)."
66,"Current literature does not support routine testing for hereditary and acquired 
thrombophilia disorders in the inpatient setting. Testing in the acute setting 
rarely changes patient management or could lead to patient mismanagement. 
Despite prior educational interventions, continued overuse of inpatient testing 
warrants further quality improvement measures. A hard-stop best practice 
advisory pop-up was implemented in the electronic medical record in a 
multicenter academic hospital system to provide clinicians guidance on the 
appropriate use of thrombophilia testing at the point of care. Pre- and 
postintervention retrospective data were collected to assess clinical features 
before and after implementation. Before the intervention, 271 patients underwent 
inpatient hypercoagulability testing; after the intervention, 238 patients 
underwent inpatient hypercoagulability testing. The total number of labs ordered 
per patient decreased from 1185 to 910, a 13% reduction (P = 0.003). Overall, 
there was a savings of $23,597 in total direct cost and $123,153 in total 
charges when comparing the 6-month timeframes before and after the intervention 
(P < 0.01). Although this study found only mild reductions in thrombophilia 
testing, it presents a new means of providing point-of-care intervention and 
education for hypercoagulability testing in the inpatient setting."
67,"Cutaneous metastasis as the presenting sign of lung cancer is rare, with a poor 
prognosis and a life expectancy of 3 to 5 months. We present the complicated 
course of a 60-year-old woman with extensive metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer that presented as a back cyst. Due to the benign appearance of the cyst 
and the difficulty discovering the location of the primary malignancy, diagnosis 
and treatment were delayed. Unfortunately, once aggressive treatment was 
initiated at the request of the patient, she died 2 weeks later. This case 
highlights the importance of recognizing cutaneous lesions as a sign of internal 
malignancy and emphasizes multidisciplinary discussion that focuses on the 
patient's quality of life."
68,"Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) has become the most utilized test for 
colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. This retrospective quality assurance report 
analyzed data for 411 patients from one academic center in Central New York who 
underwent FIT between September 2015 and September 2016. All 67 positive tests 
and 344 of 952 negative tests were analyzed. Subjects from the FIT-negative 
""control group"" were chosen at random. The mean age was 67 years and the 
male/female distribution was 391/20, with differences between the FIT-positive 
and -negative groups. FIT was inappropriately used in 210 (51%) of the 411 
patients. The most common reasons for inappropriate FIT use were a documented 
refusal of colonoscopy (39.60% of inappropriate use), FIT occurring within the 
recommended surveillance interval from previous colonoscopy (27.98%), and a 
Charlson Co-Morbidity Index score ≥5 (22.87%). Other reasons were a history of 
adenoma (9.25%), family history of CRC/high-risk adenoma <60 years of age 
(5.84%), active/overt gastrointestinal bleed (4.87%), history of CRC (1.46%), 
and history of inflammatory bowel disease (1.46%). The results of this study 
show that FIT is being utilized inappropriately about 50% of the time."
69,"CONTEXT: Outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are reported inconsistently, 
with variability in definitions and measurement. Hence, it is difficult to 
compare intervention effectiveness and synthesise outcomes for systematic 
reviews and to create clinical practice guidelines. This uncertainty in the 
evidence makes it difficult to guide patient-clinician decision-making. One 
solution is a core outcome set (COS): an agreed minimum set of outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To describe outcome reporting, definitions, and measurement 
heterogeneity as the first stage in co-creating a COS for localised renal 
cancer.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We systematically reviewed outcome reporting heterogeneity 
in effectiveness trials and observational studies in localised RCC. In total, 
2822 studies (randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control 
studies, systematic reviews) up to June 2020 meeting our inclusion criteria were 
identified. Abstracts and full texts were screened independently by two 
reviewers; in cases of disagreement, a third reviewer arbitrated. Data 
extractions were double-checked.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We included 149 studies and found that there was 
inconsistency in which outcomes were reported across studies and variability in 
the definitions used for outcomes that were conceptually the same. We structured 
our analysis using the outcome classification taxonomy proposed by Dodd et al. 
Outcomes linked to adverse events (eg, bleeding, outcomes linked to surgery) and 
renal injury outcomes (reduced renal function) were reported most commonly. 
Outcomes related to deaths from any cause and from cancer were reported in 44% 
and 25% of studies, respectively, although the time point for measurement and 
the analysis methods were inconsistent. Outcomes linked to life impact (eg, 
global quality of life) were reported least often. Clinician-reported outcomes 
are more frequently reported than patient-reported outcomes in the renal cancer 
literature.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review underscores the heterogeneity of outcome 
reporting, definitions, and measurement in research on localised renal cancer. 
It catalogues the variety of outcomes and serves as a first step towards the 
development of a COS for localised renal cancer.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We reviewed studies on localised kidney cancer and found that 
multiple terms and definitions have been used to describe outcomes. These are 
not defined consistently, and often not defined at all. Our review is the first 
phase in developing a core outcome set to allow better comparisons of studies to 
improve medical care."
70,"The breast cosmetic outcome after breast conserving therapy is essential for 
evaluating breast treatment and determining patient's remedy selection. This 
prompts the need of objective and efficient methods for breast cosmesis 
evaluations. However, current evaluation methods rely on ratings from a small 
group of physicians or semi-automated pipelines, making the processes 
time-consuming and their results inconsistent. To solve the problem, in this 
study, we proposed: 1. a fully-automatic Machine Learning Breast Cosmetic 
evaluation algorithm leveraging the state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms 
for breast detection and contour annotation, 2. a novel set of Breast Cosmesis 
features, 3. a new Breast Cosmetic dataset consisting 3k+ images from three 
clinical trials with human annotations on both breast components and their 
cosmesis scores. We show our fully-automatic framework can achieve comparable 
performance to state-of-the-art without the need of human inputs, leading to a 
more objective, low-cost and scalable solution for breast cosmetic evaluation in 
breast cancer treatment."
71,"Immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) rates increase during last years and 
implant-based reconstruction was the most commonly performed procedure. We 
examined data collected over 25 months to assess complication rate, duration of 
surgery, patient's satisfaction and cost, according to pre-pectoral or 
sub-pectoral implant-IBR. All patients who received an implant-IBR, from January 
2020 to January 2022, were included. Results were compared between pre-pectoral 
and sub-pectoral implant-IBR in univariate and multivariate analysis. We 
performed 316 implant-IBR, 218 sub-pectoral and 98 (31%) pre-pectoral. 
Pre-pectoral implant-IBR was significantly associated with the year (2021: 
OR=12.08 and 2022: OR=76.6), the surgeons and type of mastectomy (SSM vs NSM: 
OR=0.377). Complications and complications Grade 2-3 rates were 12.9% and 10.1% 
for sub-pectoral implant-IBR respectively, without significant difference with 
pre-pectoral implant-IBR: 17.3% and 13.2%. Complications Grade 2-3 were 
significantly associated with age <50-years (OR=2.27), ASA-2 status (OR=3.63) 
and cup-size >C (OR=3.08), without difference between pre and sub-pectoral 
implant-IBR. Durations of surgery were significantly associated with cup-size C 
and >C (OR=1.72 and 2.80), with sentinel lymph-node biopsy and axillary 
dissection (OR=3.66 and 9.59) and with sub-pectoral implant-IBR (OR=2.088). 
Median hospitalization stay was 1 day, without difference between pre and 
sub-pectoral implant-IBR. Cost of surgery was significantly associated with 
cup-size > C (OR=2.216) and pre-pectoral implant-IBR (OR=8.02). Bad-medium 
satisfaction and IBR-failure were significantly associated with local recurrence 
(OR=8.820), post-mastectomy radiotherapy (OR=1.904) and sub-pectoral implant-IBR 
(OR=2.098).
CONCLUSION: Complications were not different between pre and sub-pectoral 
implant-IBR. Pre-pectoral implant-IBR seems a reliable and faster technique with 
better patient satisfaction but with higher cost."
72,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the fidelity of intervention delivery and 
identify precursory factors contributing to the successful delivery and 
beneficial effects of family-oriented dignity therapy.
METHODS: This was a process evaluation with quantitative and qualitative methods 
alongside a randomized controlled trial from March to May 2019. Nonparametric 
statistics were used to analyze how participants' demographics (n ​= ​45 dyads) 
and process variables influenced the intervention effects. Fourteen patients, 11 
family caregivers, and 11 nurses were interviewed to explore their perception of 
the intervention. Conventional content analysis was adopted to analyze the 
qualitative data.
RESULTS: The fidelity was achieved with minor deviations from the protocol. 
Higher educational level and higher income were significantly correlated with 
lower levels of existential distress (H ​= ​12.20, P ​= ​0.030) and higher 
spiritual well-being (H ​= ​-16.310, P ​= ​0.031), respectively. Higher levels 
of interest were significantly correlated with lower levels of existential 
distress (H ​= ​10.396, P ​= ​0.035) and peace of mind distress (H ​= ​-16.778, 
P ​= ​0.006) and higher levels of life meaning (H ​= ​-12.808, P ​= ​0.047). 
Patients who had higher response levels to the question were significantly 
correlated with lower levels of symptom distress (H ​= ​-13.879, P ​= ​0.035). 
Four major categories were identified from the interview data: (1) benefits of 
the intervention, (2) risks of the intervention, (3) factors that enhance 
successful dignity-conserving care, and (4) difficulties and barriers to the 
delivery of dignity-conserving care.
CONCLUSIONS: Fidelity and precursory factors that enhance the beneficial effects 
of family-oriented dignity therapy were identified. Reinforcement strategies, 
such as using supplementary video, audio, and reading materials; developing a 
flexible approach to expressing feelings; and exploring lessons and achievements 
from various perspectives, are recommended for future research to enhance 
intervention effects.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial 
Registry (registration number: ChiCTR1900020806)."
73,"BACKGROUND: The intracorporeal orthotopic modified-Y ""Bordeaux"" neobladder 
(iYNB) was first described in 2016. No urodynamic evaluation of this neobladder 
has yet been performed.
OBJECTIVE: To present the urodynamic features of the iYNB and 
incontinence-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes.
DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We prospectively assessed 26 patients operated 
between September 2018 and November 2020.
SURGICAL PROCEDURE: Robotic radical cystectomy for malignant disease of the 
bladder and iYNB, performed by a single surgeon, were used.
MEASUREMENTS: Three months after surgery and in November 2021, consenting 
patients underwent clinical evaluation and multichannel urodynamic study (UDS). 
The incontinence quality of life (I-QoL) questionnaire was used to evaluate 
HRQoL. Continence was classified into day- and nighttime, and clinically defined 
as the use of zero pads. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The mean age at surgery was 65.4 yr. The mean follow-up 
period was 27 mo (12-38). The mean time for the neobladder reconstruction was 
192 min (110-340). The mean maximum capacity was 431 cm3 (range 200-553). The 
mean postvoid residual was 101.6 ml (0-310), and the rate of clean intermittent 
catheterization was 17.6%. With the exception of a significant reduction in the 
volume of the first sensation of bladder fullness, no other statistically 
significant changes in the UDS parameters of both the storage and the voiding 
phase were observed over time. Day- and nighttime continence rates were 58.8% 
and 23.5%, respectively. The mean postoperative I-QoL score was 103.3 (89-110). 
Limitations include the small number of patients and short follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The UDS evaluation of iYNB demonstrates that both the volumetric 
and the pressure characteristics are acceptable and may enhance quality of life. 
Prospective studies with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up are 
needed to further evaluate the iYNB.
PATIENT SUMMARY: The ""Bordeaux"" neobladder provides acceptable urodynamic 
outcomes. It is associated with high levels of health-related quality of life 
and good rates of continence in patients."
74,"PURPOSE: Head and neck (HN) radiation (RT) treatment planning is complex and 
resource intensive. Deviations and inconsistent plan quality significantly 
affect clinical outcomes. We sought to develop a novel automated virtual 
integrative (AVI) knowledge-based planning application to reduce planning time, 
increase consistency, and improve baseline quality.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: An in-house write-enabled script was developed from a 
library of 668 previously treated HN RT plans. Prospective hazard analysis was 
performed, and mitigation strategies were implemented before clinical release. 
The AVI-planner software was retrospectively validated in a cohort of 52 recent 
HN cases. A physician panel evaluated planning limitations during initial 
deployment, and feedback was enacted via software refinements. A final second 
set of plans was generated and evaluated. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in addition to 
generalized evaluation metric and weighted experience score were used to compare 
normal tissue sparing between final AVI planner versus respective clinically 
treated and historically accepted plans. A t test was used to compare the 
interactive time, complexity, and monitor units for AVI planner versus manual 
optimization.
RESULTS: Initially, 86% of plans were acceptable to treat, with 10% minor and 4% 
major revisions or rejection recommended. Variability was noted in plan quality 
among HN subsites, with high initial quality for oropharynx and oral cavity 
plans. Plans needing revisions were comprised of sinonasal, nasopharynx, P-16 
negative squamous cell carcinoma unknown primary, or cutaneous primary sites. 
Normal tissue sparing varied within subsites, but AVI planner significantly 
lowered mean larynx dose (median, 18.5 vs 19.7 Gy; P < .01) compared with 
clinical plans. AVI planner significantly reduced interactive optimization time 
(mean, 2 vs 85 minutes; P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: AVI planner reliably generated clinically acceptable RT plans for 
oral cavity, salivary, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx cancers. 
Physician-driven iterative learning processes resulted in favorable evolution in 
HN RT plan quality with significant time savings and improved consistency using 
AVI planner."
75,"PURPOSE: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a deadly malignancy that is 
frequently diagnosed in patients with significant medical comorbidities. When 
delivering local and regional therapy, an exceedingly narrow therapeutic window 
is encountered, which often precludes patients from receiving aggressive 
curative therapy. Radiation therapy advances including particle therapy have 
been employed in an effort to expand this therapeutic window. Here we report 
outcomes with the use of proton therapy with curative intent and immunotherapy 
to treat patients diagnosed with high-risk NSCLC.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients were determined to be high risk if they had 
severe underlying cardiopulmonary dysfunction, history of prior thoracic 
radiation therapy, and/or large volume or unfavorable location of disease (eg, 
bilateral hilar involvement, supraclavicular involvement). As such, patients 
were determined to be ineligible for conventional x-ray-based radiation therapy 
and were treated with pencil beam scanning proton beam therapy (PBS-PBT). 
Patients who demonstrated excess respiratory motion (ie, greater than 1 cm in 
any dimension noted on the 4-dimensional computed tomography simulation scan) 
were deemed to be ineligible for PBT. Toxicity was reported using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Overall survival 
and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: A total of 29 patients with high-risk NSCLC diagnoses were treated with 
PBS-PBT. The majority (55%) of patients were defined as high risk due to severe 
cardiopulmonary dysfunction. Most commonly, patients were treated definitively 
to a total dose of 6000 cGy (relative biological effectiveness) in 30 fractions 
with concurrent chemotherapy. Overall, there were a total of 6 acute grade 3 
toxicities observed in our cohort. Acute high-grade toxicities included 
esophagitis (n = 4, 14%), dyspnea (n = 1, 3.5%), and cough (n = 1, 3.5%). No 
patients developed grade 4 or higher toxicity. The majority of patients went on 
to receive immunotherapy, and high-grade pneumonitis was rare. Two-year 
progression-free and overall survival was estimated to be 51% and 67%, 
respectively. COVID-19 was confirmed or suspected to be responsible for 2 
patient deaths during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Radical PBS-PBT treatment delivered in a cohort of patients with 
high-risk lung cancer with immunotherapy is feasible with careful 
multidisciplinary evaluation and rigorous follow-up."
76,"INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) is an important treatment 
modality in metastatic NSCLC and management of immunotherapy-related adverse 
effects (irAEs) can be challenging. Retreatment after discontinuation of ICI 
because of irAEs is a frequent clinical dilemma with limited available data.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective observational study reviewed the 
clinical course of 30 patients with metastatic NSCLC in whom ICI had to be 
discontinued owing to a serious irAE after an initial objective response to 
therapy.
RESULTS: After ICI discontinuation, 14 patients (47%) developed a durable 
response of more than 6 months, seven patients (23%) developed oligoprogression 
treated with local radiotherapy leading to disease control, six patients (20%) 
had progression of disease within 6 months, and three patients (10%) died owing 
to a severe irAE.
CONCLUSIONS: A watchful waiting approach is justified after discontinuation of 
ICI owing to irAEs in patients with metastatic NSCLC with an initial response to 
therapy."
77,"Extracellular vesicles (EV) as drug delivery nanocarriers are under intense 
investigation. Although clinical-grade EVs have been produced on a large-scale, 
low yield and high production costs of natural EVs (nEV) limit the relevant 
industrial translation. Recent studies show that mechanical extrusion of cells 
can generate nEV-like cell-derived nanovesicles (CNV) which can also be used as 
drug nanocarriers. Moreover, in comparison with nEVs, CNVs have similar 
physicochemical properties. Nevertheless, a comprehensive comparison of cargo 
between nEVs and CNVs has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the aim of this 
study is to profile and compare CNVs to nEVs. Our results show that no 
significant difference was found in size, morphology, and classical markers 
between nEVs and CNVs derived from MDA-MB-231 cells. Protein sequencing data 
reveals the similarity of membrane proteins between the two groups was ~71%, 
while it was ~21% when pertaining to total protein cargo. Notably, a high 
similarity of membrane proteins was also found between nEVs and CNVs derived 
from eight additional cancer cell lines. Moreover, analysis of the top 1000 
small RNAs with RNA sequencing showed a ~65% similarity between the two groups. 
Altogether, we infer from the high similarity of membrane proteins and small RNA 
cargo that CNVs can be a good substitute for nEVs. In brief, our findings 
support previous studies with a notion that CNVs yield comparable performance 
with nEVs and could pave the way for clinical implementation of CNV-based 
therapeutics in the future."
78,"BACKGROUND: Despite the implementation of various cancer therapies, adequate 
therapeutic efficacy has not been achieved. A growing number of studies have 
been dedicated to the discovery of new molecules to combat refractory cancer 
cells efficiently. Recently, the use of a rare type of sugar, D-allose, has 
attracted the attention of research communities. In combination with the 
first-line treatment of cancers, including different types of radiotherapies and 
chemotherapies, D-allose has been detected with favorable complementary effects. 
Understanding the mechanism of therapeutic target molecules will enable us to 
develop new strategies for cancer patients that do not currently respond to the 
present therapies.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to provide a review of the effects of D-allose in cancer 
treatment, its mechanisms of action, and gaps in this field that require more 
investigations.
DISCUSSION: With rare exceptions, in many cancer types, including head and neck, 
lung, liver, bladder, blood, and breast, D-allose consistently has exhibited 
anticancer activity in vitro and/or in vivo. Most of the D-allose functions are 
mediated through thioredoxin-interacting protein molecules. D-allose exerts its 
effects via reactive oxygen species regulation, cell cycle arrest, metabolic 
reprogramming, autophagy, apoptosis induction, and sensitizing tumors to 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: D-allose has shown great promise for combating tumor cells with no 
side effects, especially in combination with first-line drugs; however, its 
potential for cancer therapy has not been comprehensively investigated in vitro 
or in vivo."
79,"World Health Organization has reported an estimated 1.5 million deaths directly 
due to diabetes in 2019. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in its 
National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2020, says that 1 in 10 United States 
residents has diabetes. This rapid progression of diabetes is noteworthy despite 
significant advances in the field of antidiabetic medicine. The critical 
challenges in treatment are dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. 
The latest research has also linked diabetes to carcinogenesis. The diabetic 
condition leads to the acceleration of cell growth, proliferation, migration, 
inflammation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and inhibition of apoptosis in cancer 
cells. In addition, diabetic complications of nephropathy, retinopathy, 
neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, peripheral arterial disease, coronary artery 
disease, and stroke increase morbidity. Amidst all these challenges, a ray of 
hope is the advent of nanocarriers. The nano size helps in the targeted and 
controlled delivery of drugs. In addition, nanocarrier formulation helps in the 
delivery of acid-labile and enzyme-labile molecules, and plant-based 
macromolecules via the oral route. Its use in the form of dendrimers, ethosomes, 
niosomes, transfersomes, and polymeric nanoparticles is established. In 
addition, different polymers used to formulate nanocarriers are also established 
for targeting in diabetes. Thus, this review aims to compile approaches 
involving the use of nanocarriers for the betterment of pharmacotherapy of 
diabetes and to provide a way ahead for researchers in the field."

81,"Bioorthogonal catalysis mediated by Pd-based transition metal catalysts has 
sparked increasing interest in combating diseases. However, the catalytic and 
therapeutic efficiency of current Pd0 catalysts is unsatisfactory. Herein, 
inspired by the concept that ligands around metal sites could enable enzymes to 
catalyze astonishing reactions by changing their electronic environment, LM-Pd 
catalyst with liquid metal (LM) as an unusual modulator has been designed to 
realize efficient bioorthogonal catalysis for tumor inhibition. LM matrix can 
serve as a ""ligand"" to afford an electron-rich environment to stabilize the 
active Pd0 and promote nucleophilic turnover of the p-allylpalladium species to 
accelerate the uncaging process. Besides, the photothermal properties of LM can 
lead to the enhanced removal of tumor cells by photo-enhanced catalysis and 
photothermal effect. We believe that our work will broaden the application of LM 
and motivate the design of bioinspired bioorthogonal catalysts."
82,"RNF7 has been reported to play critical roles in various cancers. However, the 
underlying mechanisms of RNF7 in glioma development remain largely unknown. 
Herein, the expression level of RNF7 was examined in tissues by quantitative 
real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The effect of RNF7 on 
glioma progression was measured by performing CCK-8 and apoptosis assays, cell 
cycle-related experiments and animal experiments. The effect of RNF7 on PI3K/AKT 
signalling pathway was tested by Western blotting. First, we found that RNF7 was 
upregulated in tumour tissue compared with normal brain tissue, especially in 
high-grade glioma, and the high expression of RNF7 was significantly related to 
tumour size, Karnofsky Performance Scale score and a poor prognosis. Second, 
RNF7 overexpression facilitated tumour cell cycle progression and cell 
proliferation and suppressed apoptosis. Conversely, RNF7 knockdown suppressed 
tumour cell cycle progression and cell proliferation and facilitated apoptosis. 
Furthermore, follow-up mechanistic studies indicated that RNF7 could facilitate 
glioma cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and inhibit apoptosis by 
activating the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. This study shows that RNF7 can 
clearly promote glioma cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle progression 
and inhibiting apoptosis by activating the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. 
Targeting the RNF7/PI3K/AKT axis may provide a new perspective on the prevention 
or treatment of glioma."
83,"The assessment of risk related to medical exposures as a justification tool to 
assist decision-making of the medical team is not available in clinical routine. 
The determination of diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for nuclear medicine 
(NM) procedures has been proposed as an optimization tool, but this tool has 
still been aimed at a standard adult individual. It is known that the activity 
administered, and the consequent absorbed doses in critical organs, represents 
the risk of a procedure being cancer induction the greatest concern, especially 
for young patients. Thus, the adjustment of administered activity and procedure 
risk to promote risk-benefit assessment is a promising tool for routine clinical 
use. This work aims to present a tool for determining DRLs in the administered 
activity related to the patient's characteristics-age group, sex, and body mass 
index (BMI), in order to assist the medical decision regarding the risk-benefit 
ratio. Thus, it is possible to assess the risk of carcinogenesis in groups of 
patients, considering absorbed doses in organs, cancer incidence, and mortality 
rates in our country. NIREA is an IT tool developed in PHP language for web 
environment as a friendly software. It allows the establishment of DRL and risk 
of cancer induced by radiation assessment through the estimation of absorbed 
doses in specific organs and based on the risk methodology of BEIR VII. The 
absorbed and effective doses were estimated based on the dose conversion factors 
of the radiopharmaceuticals published by the International Commission on 
Radiological Protection adjusted for the patient groups. Based on data from 2256 
patients who underwent diagnostic procedures at National Cancer Institute 
between 2017 and 2019, the program was used, resulting in important information 
for conducting the clinical routine extracted as DRL, absorbed doses, and risk 
assessments, considering patient-specific data such as age, sex, and BMI. The 
methodology developed in this work allows NM services to keep their data 
available and updated regarding local DRLs, in addition to allowing the nuclear 
physician to know the risk of each procedure performed, extracted by individual 
characteristics of the patient. The affirmative is significant because the data 
could be used by the regulatory body of practices with ionizing radiation in 
Brazil to establish a reference level in Activity that has not yet existed in 
the country."
84,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Few studies have investigated the long-term outcomes of 
endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer (EGC) in very elderly patients. 
The aim of this study was to determine the appropriate treatment strategy and 
identify the risk factors for mortality in these patients.
METHODS: Patients with EGC who underwent endoscopic resection from 2006 to 2017 
were identified using National Health Insurance Data and divided into three age 
groups: very elderly (≥85 years), elderly (65 to 84 years), and non-elderly (≤64 
years). Their long- and short-term outcomes were compared in the three age 
groups, and the survival in the groups was compared with that in the control 
group, matched by age and sex. We also evaluated the risk factors for long- and 
short-term outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 8,426 patients were included in our study: 118 very elderly, 
4,583 elderly, and 3,725 non-elderly. The overall survival and cancer-specific 
survival rates were significantly lower in the very elderly group than in the 
elderly and the non-elderly groups. Congestive heart failure was negatively 
associated with cancer-specific survival. A significantly decreased risk for 
mortality was observed in all groups (p<0.001). The very elderly group had 
significantly higher readmission and mortality rates within 3 months of 
endoscopic resection than the non-elderly and elderly groups. Furthermore, the 
cerebrovascular disease was associated with mortality within 3 months after 
endoscopic resection.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic resection for EGC can be helpful for very elderly 
patients, and it may play a role in achieving overall survival comparable to 
that of the control group."
85,"OBJECTIVES: Androgen receptor (AR) play a key role in the onset and progression 
of prostate cancer. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a polyphenolic compound 
and the active ingredient in green tea, which is involved in modulating gene 
expression through epigenetic alterations. Previous studies have shown that EGCG 
at low concentrations reduces the expression of AR and prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) in the LNCaP cell line of prostate cancer. In this study, the effect of 
higher EGCG concentrations on AR and PSA expression in LNCaP prostate cancer 
cell line was investigated.
METHODS: In this study, LNCaP prostate cancer cell line was used and after MTT 
test, concentrations of 40, 60 and 80 μg/mL EGCG were used for treatment. Then, 
the expression of AR and PSA genes was evaluated by RT-PCR. AR protein 
expression was also assessed by Western blotting.
RESULTS: The present study showed that treatment of LNCaPs cells by EGCG reduces 
cell proliferation. The IC50 value was 42.7 μg/mL under experimental conditions. 
It was also observed that EGCG at concentrations of 40 and 80 μg/mL increased 
the expression of AR and PSA (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the effect of EGCG on AR expression 
was different at different concentrations, so that unlike previous studies, 
higher concentrations of EGCG (80 and 40 μg/mL) increased AR and PSA expression. 
It seems that due to the toxic effects of EGCG in high concentrations on cancer 
cells and the possibility of its effect on normal cells, more caution should be 
exercised in its use."
86,"Unlike birds and mammals, many teleosts have homomorphic sex chromosomes and 
changes in the chromosome carrying the sex-determining locus, termed 
""turnovers"", are common. Recent turnovers allow studies of several interesting 
questions. One question is whether the new sex-determining regions evolve to 
become completely non-recombining, and if so, how and why. Another is to test 
the prediction that evolutionary changes that benefit one sex will accumulate in 
the newly sex-linked region. To study these questions, we analyzed the genome 
sequences of two seahorse species of the Syngnathidae, a fish group in which 
many species evolved a unique structure, the male brood pouch. We find that both 
seahorse species have XY sex chromosome systems, and their sex chromosome pairs 
are not homologs, implying that at least one turnover event has occurred. The 
Y-linked regions respectively occupy 63.9% and 95.1% of the entire chromosome of 
the two species, and do not exhibit extensive sequence divergence with their 
X-linked homologs. We find evidence for occasional recombination between the 
extant sex chromosomes that may account for their homomorphic pattern. We argue 
that these Y-linked regions did not evolve by recombination suppression after 
the turnover. Instead, it can be explained by the ancestral nature of low 
crossover rate at the corresponding chromosome location. With such an ancestral 
crossover landscape, a turnover can instantly create an extensive Y-linked 
region. Finally, we investigate the adaptive evolution of male pouch related 
genes after they become Y-linked in the seahorse."
87,"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in tumour 
initiation and progression. However, little is known about their contributions 
to p53-related bladder cancer (BC) inhibition.
METHODS: By using high-throughput sequencing, we screened the expression 
profiles of lncRNAs in BC and adjacent non-tumour tissues. The roles of a novel 
lncRNA, named LNPPS [a lncRNA for programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) and p53 
stability], were determined by gain- and loss-of-function assays. RNA pull-down 
followed by mass spectrometry analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation assays and other 
immunoprecipitation assays were performed to reveal the interactions among 
LNPPS, PDCD5 and p53, and the regulatory effect of LNPPS on the complex 
ubiquitination network comprising PDCD5, p53 and mouse double minute 2 homologue 
(MDM2).
RESULTS: LNPPS was downregulated in BC and markedly inhibited the viability of 
BC cells by inducing PDCD5/p53-related apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. 
Mechanistically, LNPPS, serving as a scaffold, connected PDCD5 and p53 with 
nucleotides (nt) located at 121-251 nt and 251-306 nt of LNPPS, respectively. 
This process allowed LNPPS to protect PDCD5 from proteasomal degradation by 
blocking its K20 site ubiquitination. On the other hand, the increased 
interaction between PDCD5 and p53 displaced p53 from the MDM2-p53 ubiquitination 
complex, resulting in an increase in p53 expression and related apoptosis 
levels. Moreover, LNPPS could induce the accumulation of PDCD5 and p53 in the 
nucleus and exert a synergistic effect on the prevention of protein degradation. 
In addition, we confirmed that the downregulation of LNPPS in BC was mediated by 
the decreased N6-methyladenosine (m6 A) modification.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight a novel cross-talk between LNPPS and the 
PDCD5/p53/MDM2 ubiquitination axis in BC development, indicating its potential 
as a therapeutic target for BC patients."
88,"OBJECTIVES: When primary treatment has been inadequate, nivolumab and axitinib 
are often used as a secondary treatments for patients with metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma (mRCC). However, there have been few reports comparing the efficacy 
and safety of these drugs.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 58 patients treated with nivolumab and 
57 patients treated with axitinib as secondary treatment between April 2013 and 
December 2019. We then assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of the 
treatments in both groups.
RESULTS: The most common primary therapy was sunitinib (61.7%). Both nivolumab 
and axitinib groups showed no significant differences in terms of the objective 
response rate and disease control rate (p = 0.280 and p = 0.518, respectively). 
Importantly, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) seemed to 
be similar in patients treated with nivolumab and axitinib (p = 0.527 and 
p = 0.266, respectively), irrespective of the objective response to primary 
therapy. Furthermore, a Cox proportional hazards model showed that pretreatment 
Karnofsky Performance Status was significantly associated with PFS and OS. 
Although the incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the 
patients treated with axitinib, there was no significant difference in time to 
treatment failure between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab and axitinib showed similar clinical benefits as 
secondary treatment in patients with mRCC; thus, they should be an option in 
sequential therapy following treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). 
Future studies and feasible therapeutic biomarkers would help predict the 
clinical response to TKIs or immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with mRCC."
89,"TP53 missense mutations that express highly stabilized mutant p53 protein 
(mutp53) driving tumorigenesis have been witnessed in a considerable percentage 
of human cancers. The attempt to induce degradation of mutp53 has thus been an 
attractive strategy to realize precise antitumor therapy, but currently, there 
has been no FDA-approved medication for mutp53 cancer. Herein, we discovered a 
small molecule compound crizotinib, an FDA-approved antitumor drug, exhibited 
outstanding mutp53-degrading capability. Crizotinib induced 
ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation of wide-spectrum mutp53 but not 
the wild-type p53 protein. Degradation of mutp53 by crizotinib eliminated 
mutp53-conferred gain-of-function (GOF), leading to reduced cell proliferation, 
migration, demise, and cell cycle arrest, as well as enhanced sensitivity to 
doxorubicin-elicited killing in mutp53 cancer. To alleviate the side effects and 
improve the therapeutic effect, we adopted poly(ethylene 
glycol)-polylactide-co-glycolide (PEG-PLGA) nanomicelles to deliver the 
hydrophobic drugs doxorubicin and crizotinib, demonstrating that crizotinib 
nanomicelles effectively enhanced doxorubicin-elicited anticancer efficacy in a 
p53Y220C pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo via mutp53 degradation induced 
by crizotinib, manifesting its promising application in clinical practice. Our 
work therefore revealed that crizotinib exerted significant synergistic 
chemotherapy with doxorubicin and suggested a novel combination therapeutic 
strategy for targeting p53 cancer in further clinical application."
90,"BACKGROUND: Tumor size and consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) are crucial for 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis. However, the optimal CTR cutoff 
remains unclear. Whether tumor size and CTR are independent prognostic factors 
for part-solid NSCLC is under debate. Here, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic 
impacts of CTR and tumor size on NSCLC, especially on part-solid NSCLC.
METHODS: We reviewed 1366 clinical T1 NSCLC patients who underwent surgical 
treatment. Log-rank test and Cox regression analyses were adopted for prognostic 
evaluation. The ""surv_cutpoint"" function was used to identify the optimal CTR 
and tumor size cutoff values.
RESULTS: There were 416, 510, and 440 subjects with pure ground-glass opacity 
(pGGO), part-solid, and pure solid nodules. The 5-year overall survival 
(disease-free survival) for patients with pGGO, part-solid, and pure solid 
nodules were 99.5% (99.5%), 97.3% (95.8%), and 90.4% (78.9%), respectively. 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that CTR was an independent 
prognostic factor for the whole patients, and the optimal CTR cutoff was 0.99. 
However, for part-solid NSCLC, CTR was not independently associated with 
survival, even if categorized by the optimal cutoffs. The predicted optimal 
cutoffs of total tumor size and solid component size were 2.4 and 1.4 cm for 
part-solid NSCLC. Total tumor size (HR = 6.21, 95% CI: 1.58-24.34, p = 0.009) 
and solid component size (HR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.04-5.92, p = 0.045) grouped by 
the cutoffs were significantly associated with part-solid NSCLC prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: CTR was an independent prognostic factor for the whole NSCLC, but 
not for the part-solid NSCLC. Tumor size was still meaningful for part-solid 
NSCLC."
91,"Bronchiolar adenoma (BA)/ciliated muconodular papillary tumor (CMPT) is defined 
as a benign tumor composed of epithelial and basal cells. Recently, some cases 
with driver mutations or malignant transformation have been observed. Thus, 
whether BA/CMPT is benign or malignant remains controversial. We herein report 
an extremely rare case of a 68-year-old woman with a CMPT accompanied by 
adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). BA/CMPT existed inside the AIS. The BA/CMPT 
component did not show any driver mutations; however, the AIS component had an 
EGFR driver mutation in exon 19. The accumulation of cases and further studies 
are needed to discuss the malignant potential of BA/CMPT."
92,"Inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) has been demonstrated to be an 
effective strategy for cancer treatment. In this work, we have developed a new 
agent Ir-VPA, which exhibits the cell death mode switching between apoptosis and 
autophagy due to the distinct level of HDAC6 inhibition. Ir-VPA indicates the 
best anticancer activity to HeLa cells, and could be hydrolyzed due to the high 
expression of the esterase in HeLa cells. Ir-VPA could accumulate in nuclei, 
induce severe DNA damages and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. The anticancer 
mechanism of Ir-VPA to HeLa cells was dependent on the HDAC6 inhibitory 
performance, as the caspase dependent apoptosis at low concentration (IC50) and 
autophagy with the autophagy flux blockage at high concentration (2xIC50). This 
is resulted from the distinct inhibitory levels of HDAC6, as moderate/complete 
inhibition at the concentration of IC50 /2xIC50.In the presence of autophagic 
inhibitor chloroquine, the apoptotic population elevated from 32.7% to 61.7%, 
indicating that Ir-VPA could activate apoptotic process through the 
autophagolysosome fusion inhibition. Ir-VPA also exhibits excellent 
antiproliferative behavior to 3D HeLa multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTSs). 
This work not only provided a new HDAC6 inhibitor and novel anticancer mechanism 
for the effective treatment of cervical cancer, but also demonstrated the 
strategy to conjugate the metal fragment with active organic drug to enhance the 
anticancer performance."
93,"BACKGROUND: A preoperative-progesterone intervention increases disease-free 
survival in patients with breast cancer, with an unknown underlying mechanism. 
We elucidated the role of non-coding RNAs in response to progesterone in human 
breast cancer.
METHODS: Whole transcriptome sequencing dataset of 30 breast primary tumors (10 
tumors exposed to hydroxyprogesterone and 20 tumors as control) were re-analyzed 
to identify differentially expressed non-coding RNAs followed by real-time PCR 
analyses to validate the expression of candidates. Functional analyses were 
performed by genetic knockdown, biochemical, and cell-based assays.
RESULTS: We identified a significant downregulation in the expression of a long 
non-coding RNA, Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule antisense DSCAM-AS1, in 
response to progesterone treatment in breast cancer. The progesterone-induced 
expression of DSCAM-AS1 could be effectively blocked by the knockdown of 
progesterone receptor (PR) or treatment of cells with mifepristone 
(PR-antagonist). We further show that knockdown of DSCAM-AS1 mimics the effect 
of progesterone in impeding cell migration and invasion in PR-positive breast 
cancer cells, while its overexpression shows an opposite effect. Additionally, 
DSCAM-AS1 sponges the activity of miR-130a that regulates the expression of ESR1 
by binding to its 3'-UTR to mediate the effect of progesterone in breast cancer 
cells. Consistent with our findings, TCGA analysis suggests that high levels of 
miR-130a correlate with a tendency toward better overall survival in patients 
with breast cancer.
CONCLUSION: This study presents a mechanism involving the 
DSCAM-AS1/miR-130a/ESR1 genomic axis through which progesterone impedes breast 
cancer cell invasion and migration. The findings highlight the utility of 
progesterone treatment in impeding metastasis and improving survival outcomes in 
patients with breast cancer."
94,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial disease with genetic and 
environmental factors. Regional differences in risk factors are an important 
reason for the different incidences of CRC in different regions.
OBJECTIVE: The goal was to clarify the intestinal microbial composition and 
structure of CRC patients in different regions and construct CRC risk prediction 
models based on regional differences.
METHODS: A metagenomic dataset of 601 samples from 6 countries in the GMrepo and 
NCBI databases was collected. All whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data were 
annotated for species by MetaPhlAn2. We obtained the relative abundance of 
species composition at the species level and genus level. The MicrobiotaProcess 
package was used to visualize species composition and PCA. LEfSe analysis was 
used to analyze the differences in the datasets in each region. Spearman 
correlation analysis was performed for CRC differential species. Finally, the 
CRC risk prediction model was constructed and verified in each regional dataset.
RESULTS: The composition of the intestinal bacterial community varied in 
different regions. Differential intestinal bacteria of CRC in different regions 
are inconsistent. There was a common diversity of bacteria in all six countries, 
such as Peptostreptococcus stomatis and Fusobacterium nucleatum at the species 
level. Peptostreptococcus stomatis (species level) and Peptostreptococcus (genus 
level) are important CRC-related bacteria that are related to other bacteria in 
different regions. Region has little influence on the accuracy of the CRC risk 
prediction model. Peptostreptococcus stomatis is an important variable in CRC 
risk prediction models in all regions.
CONCLUSION: Peptostreptococcus stomatis is a common high-risk pathogen of CRC 
worldwide, and it is an important variable in CRC risk prediction models in all 
regions. However, regional differences in intestinal bacteria had no significant 
impact on the accuracy of the CRC risk prediction model."
95,"The standard therapies in lymphoma have predominantly focused on targeting tumor 
cells with less of a focus on the tumor microenvironment (TME), which plays a 
critical role in favoring tumor growth and survival. Such an approach may result 
in increasingly refractory disease with progressively reduced responses to 
subsequent treatments. To overcome this hurdle, targeting the TME has emerged as 
a new therapeutic strategy. The TME consists of T and B lymphocytes, 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and other components. Understanding the 
TME can lead to a comprehensive approach to managing lymphoma, resulting in 
therapeutic strategies that target not only cancer cells, but also the 
supportive environment and thereby ultimately improve survival of lymphoma 
patients. Here, we review the normal function of different components of the 
TME, the impact of their aberrant behavior in B cell lymphoma and the current 
TME-direct therapeutic avenues."
96,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative sarcopenia is a predictor of poor survival in cancer 
patients. We hypothesized that sarcopenia could progress as occult metastasis 
arose, especially after highly invasive surgery for highly aggressive 
malignancy. This study aimed to evaluate the associations of postoperative 
changes in skeletal muscle mass volume with survival outcomes in patients who 
underwent surgery for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.
METHODS: Fifty-six patients who underwent major hepatectomy with extrahepatic 
bile duct resection for perihilar cholangiocarcinoma were studied. The skeletal 
muscle index (SMI) at the third lumbar vertebra was calculated from axial 
computed tomography images taken preoperatively and 3-6 months postoperatively 
(early postoperative period). The associations of clinicopathological variables, 
including changes of SMI after surgery, with overall survival and 
recurrence-free survival were evaluated. Moreover, the associations of decreased 
SMI and elevated serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level with early recurrence and 
poor survival was compared.
RESULTS: Among 56 patients, 26 (46%) had sarcopenia preoperatively and SMI 
decreased in 29 (52%) in the early postoperative period. During the median 
follow-up of 57.9 months, 35 patients (63%) developed recurrence and 29 (50%) 
died. Decreased SMI in the early postoperative period was independently 
associated with a shorter overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.00-6.18; P = 0.049) and a shorter recurrence-free survival (hazard 
ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-4.57; P = 0.039), whereas elevated 
carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level was not.
CONCLUSIONS: Decreased SMI in the early postoperative period may be used as a 
predictor for recurrence and poor survival in patients undergoing surgery for 
perihilar cholangiocarcinoma."
97,"BACKGROUND: Osimertinib is associated with a relatively high frequency of 
drug-induced interstitial lung disease (D-ILD), and transient asymptomatic 
pulmonary opacities (TAPO) have been reported to occur during osimertinib 
administration. The frequency of TAPO during first-line treatment and the pros 
and cons of osimertinib continuation is unknown.
METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective study. The purpose of this study 
was to research the frequency of TAPO and to evaluate osimertinib continuation 
in first-line therapy. We also evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) 
including subgroup analysis.
RESULTS: From August 2018 to December 2020, 133 patients were enrolled into the 
study. The median observation period was 23.2 months (0.3-48.3 months). Thirty 
patients (22.6%) experienced D-ILD events, including 16 patients (12.1%) with 
CTCAE grade 1, five patients (3.8%) with grade 2, and nine patients (6.7%) with 
grade 3 and above D-ILD. Among the patients with grade 1 D-ILD, 11 cases (8.3%) 
of TAPO were observed, and all patients succeeded in osimertinib continuation. 
The TAPO images were characterized by localized patchy opacities (73%). The 
median PFS was 22.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.8-28.7 months). 
Patients with TAPO had a significantly longer PFS than patients with non-TAPO 
D-ILD in the multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that grade 1 D-ILD might include TAPO and that 
patients with TAPO might have good PFS. We need to consider the possibility of 
osimertinib continuation when lung opacities appear."
98,"BACKGROUND: Sterile alpha motif domain and histidine-aspartate domain-containing 
protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a DNA end resection factor, which is involved in DNA 
damage repair and innate immunity. However, the role of SAMHD1 in anti-tumor 
immunity is still unknown. This study investigated the effects of SAMHD1 on 
stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-type I interferon (IFN) pathway and 
radiation-induced immune responses.
METHODS: The roles of SAMHD1 in the activation of cytosolic DNA sensing STING 
pathway in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells were investigated with flow 
cytometry, immunofluorescence, immunoblotting and qPCR. The combined effects of 
SAMHD1 silencing and radiation on tumor cell growth and STING pathway activation 
were also evaluated with colony formation and CCK8 assay. The Lewis lung cancer 
mouse model was used to evaluate the combined efficiency of SAMHD1 silencing and 
radiotherapy in vivo. Macrophage M1 polarization and cytotoxic T cell 
infiltration were evaluated with flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) accumulated in the cytosol of 
SAMHD1-deficient lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells, accompanied by upregulated 
DNA sensor IFN-γ-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) and activated STING pathway. The 
translocation of IFI16 from nucleus to cytosol was detected in SAMHD1-deficient 
cells. IFI16 and STING were acquired in the activation of STING-IFN-I pathway in 
SAMHD1-deficient cells. SAMHD1 silencing in LUAD cells promoted macrophage M1 
polarization in vitro. SAMHD1 silencing synergized with radiation to activate 
ssDNA-STING-IFN-I pathway, inhibit proliferation, promote apoptosis and regulate 
cell cycle. SAMHD1 silencing cooperated with radiotherapy to inhibit tumor 
growth and increase CD86+MHC-IIhigh M1 proportion and CD8+ T cell infiltration 
in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: SAMHD1 deficiency induced IFN-I production through cytosolic 
IFI16-STING pathway in LUAD cells. Moreover, SAMHD1 downregulation and radiation 
cooperated to inhibit tumor growth and enhance anti-tumor immune responses 
through macrophage M1 polarization and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Combination of 
SAMHD1 inhibition and radiotherapy may be a potentially therapeutic strategy for 
LUAD patients."
99,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is one of the main treatments for esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma (ESCC), but its efficacy is limited by radioresistance. MicroRNAs 
play a crucial role in posttranscriptional regulation, which is linked to the 
cancer response to radiation.
METHODS: We successfully established a radioresistant cell line model by using 
fractionated irradiation. qRT-PCR was adopted to detect the expression of 
miR-4443 in human normal esophageal cell lines, tumor cells, and radioresistant 
cells. Next, CCK-8, colony formation, apoptosis, and cell cycle assays were used 
to assess the biological effect of miR-4443. Weighted gene coexpression network 
analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify potential radiosensitivity-related 
genes. Additionally, we predicted the probable targets of the miRNA using 
bioinformatic methods and confirmed them using Western blot.
RESULTS: miR-4443 was significantly upregulated in radioresistant ESCC cells. 
Enhancement of miR-4443 further decreased the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells, 
while inhibition of miR-4443 increased the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells. 
Notably, miR-4443 modulated radiosensitivity by influencing DNA damage repair, 
apoptosis, and G2 cycle arrest. By using WGCNA and experimental validation, we 
identified PTPRJ as a key target for miRNA-4443 to regulate radiosensitivity. 
The effects of miR-4443 overexpression or inhibition could be reversed by 
increasing or decreasing PTPRJ expression.
CONCLUSION: In this study, miR-4443 is found to promote radiotherapy resistance 
in ESCC cells by regulating PTPRJ expression, which provides a new perspective 
and clue to alleviate radioresistance."
100,"BACKGROUND: The infrapatellar fat pad (IFP) is the largest adipose deposit in 
the knee; however, its contributions to the homeostasis of this organ remain 
undefined. To determine the influence of the IFP and its associated synovium 
(IFP/synovium complex or IFP/SC) on joint health, this study evaluated the 
progression of osteoarthritis (OA) following excision of this unit in a rodent 
model of naturally-occurring disease.
METHODS: Male Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs (n=18) received surgical removal of the 
IFP in one knee at 3 months of age; contralateral knees received sham surgery as 
matched internal controls. Mobility and gait assessments were performed prior to 
IFP/SC removal and monthly thereafter. Animals were harvested at 7 months of 
age. Ten set of these knees were processed for microcomputed tomography 
(microCT), histopathology, transcript expression analyses, and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC); 8 sets of knees were dedicated to microCT and 
biomechanical testing (material properties of knee joints tissues and anterior 
drawer laxity).
RESULTS: Fibrous connective tissue (FCT) developed in place of the native 
adipose depot. Gait demonstrated no significant differences between IFP/SC 
removal and contralateral hindlimbs. MicroCT OA scores were improved in knees 
containing the FCT. Quantitatively, IFP/SC-containing knees had more osteophyte 
development and increased trabecular volume bone mineral density (vBMD) in 
femora and tibiae. Histopathology confirmed maintenance of articular cartilage 
structure, proteoglycan content, and chondrocyte cellularity in FCT-containing 
knees. Transcript analyses revealed decreased expression of adipose-related 
molecules and select inflammatory mediators in FCTs compared to IFP/SCs. This 
was verified via IHC for two key inflammatory agents. The medial articular 
cartilage in knees with native IFP/SCs showed an increase in equilibrium 
modulus, which correlated with increased amounts of magnesium and phosphorus.
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Formation of the FCT resulted in reduced OA-associated 
changes in both bone and cartilage. This benefit may be associated with: a 
decrease in inflammatory mediators at transcript and protein levels; and/or 
improved biomechanical properties. Thus, the IFP/SC may play a role in the 
pathogenesis of knee OA in this strain, with removal prior to disease onset 
appearing to have short-term benefits."
101,"BACKGROUND: Evidence from previous studies has suggested that ginger extract 
exhibits the potential as an alternative treatment for Coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). Here, we want to investigate whether ginger supplement improves the 
clinical manifestation of hospitalized COVID-19 individuals.
METHODS: A total of 227 hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 were randomized 
to either the control (n = 132) or intervention group (n = 95). The intervention 
group took ginger supplement orally at the dosage of 1.5 g twice daily, until 
they were discharged from the hospital. Both groups received the same standard 
of general medical care during hospitalization, and the length of stay was 
recorded and compared between groups.
RESULTS: Among all participants, a significant reduction in hospitalization time 
(the difference between the treatment and control groups was 2.4 d, 95% CI 
1.6-3.2) was detected in response to the ginger supplement. This effect was more 
pronounced in men, participants aged 60 years or older, and participants with 
pre-existing medical conditions, relative to their counterparts 
(P-interactions < 0.05 for all).
CONCLUSION: Ginger supplement significantly shortened the length of stay of 
hospitalized individuals with COVID-19.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial 
Registry (ChiCTR2200059824)."
102,"Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer among women. Approximately 15-20% of 
all breast cancers are highly invasive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 
lack estrogen, progesterone, and ERBB2 receptors. TNBC is challenging to treat 
due to its aggressive nature with far fewer targeted therapies than other breast 
cancer subtypes. Current treatments for patients with TNBC consist of cytotoxic 
chemotherapies, surgery, radiation, and in some instances PARP inhibitors and 
immunotherapy. To advance current therapeutics, we repurposed mebendazole (MBZ), 
an orally available FDA-approved anthelmintic that has shown preclinical 
efficacy for cancers. MBZ has low toxicity in humans and efficacy in multiple 
cancer models including breast cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, 
colon cancer, pancreatic and thyroid cancer. MBZ was well-tolerated in a phase I 
clinical trial of adults recently diagnosed with glioma. We determined that the 
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of MBZ in four breast cancer cell 
lines is well within the range reported for other types of cancer. MBZ reduced 
TNBC cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and caused G2/M cell cycle arrest. 
MBZ reduced the size of primary tumors and prevented lung and liver metastases. 
In addition, we uncovered a novel mechanism of action for MBZ. We found that MBZ 
reduces integrin β4 (ITGβ4) expression and cancer stem cell properties. ITGβ4 
has previously been implicated in promoting ""cancer stemness,"" which may 
contribute to the efficacy of MBZ. Collectively, our results contribute to a 
growing body of evidence suggesting that MBZ should be considered as a 
therapeutic to slow tumor progression and prevent metastasis."
103,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer and the 
second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. CRC patients present with 
an increase in pathogens in their gut microbiota, such as polyketide 
synthase-positive bacteria (pks +) and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis 
(ETBF). The pks + Escherichia coli promotes carcinogenesis and facilitates CRC 
progression through the production of colibactin, a genotoxin that induces 
double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). ETBF is a procarcinogenic bacterium producing 
the B. fragilis toxin (bft) that promotes colorectal carcinogenesis by 
modulating the mucosal immune response and inducing epithelial cell changes.
METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from healthy controls (N = 62) and CRC 
patients (N = 94) from the province of Québec (Canada), and a bacterial DNA 
extraction was performed. Fecal DNA samples were then examined for the presence 
of the pks island gene and bft using conventional qualitative PCR.
RESULTS: We found that a high proportion of healthy controls are colonized by 
pks + bacteria (42%) and that these levels were similar in CRC patients (46%). 
bft was detected in 21% of healthy controls and 32% of CRC patients, while 
double colonization by both pks + bacteria and ETBF occurred in 8% of the 
healthy controls and 13% of the CRC patients. Most importantly, we found that 
early-onset CRC (< 50 years) patients were significantly less colonized with 
pks + bacteria (20%) compared to late-onset CRC patients (52%).
CONCLUSIONS: Healthy controls had similar levels of pks + bacteria and ETBF 
colonization as CRC patients, and their elevated levels may place both groups at 
greater risk of developing CRC. Colonization with pks + bacteria was less 
prevalent in early-compared to late-onset CRC."
104,"BACKGROUND: The injection activity of tracer, acquisition time, patient-specific 
photon attenuation, and large body mass, can influence on image quality. Fixed 
acquisition time and body mass related injection activity in clinical practice 
results in a large difference in image quality. Thus, this study proposes a 
patient-specific acquisition time regimen of 68 Ga-DOTATATE total-body positron 
emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) to counteract the influence of 
body mass (BM, kg) on image quality, and acquire an acceptable and constant 
image of patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).
METHODS: The development cohort consisting of 19 consecutive patients with full 
activity (88.7-204.9 MBq, 2.0 ± 0.1 MBq/kg) was to establish the acquisition 
time regimen. The liver SNR (signal-to-noise ratio, SNRL) was normalized 
(SNRnorm) by the product of injected activity (MBq) and acquisition time (min). 
Fitting of SNRnorm against body mass (BM, kg) in linear correlation was 
performed. Subjective assessment of image quality was performed using a 5-point 
Likert scale to determine the acceptable threshold of SNRL, and an optimized 
acquisition regimen based on BM was proposed, and validated its feasibility 
through the validation cohort of 57 consecutive NET patients with half activity 
(66.9 ± 11.3 MBq, 1.0 ± 0.1 MBq/kg) and a fixed acquisition time regimen.
RESULTS: The linear correlation (R2 = 0.63) between SNRnorm and BM (kg) was 
SNRnorm = -0.01*BM + 1.50. The threshold SNRL of acceptable image quality was 
11.2. The patient-specific variable acquisition time regimen was determined as: 
t (min) = 125.4/(injective activity)*(-0.01*BM + 1.50)2. Based on that proposed 
regimen, the average acquisition time for acceptable image quality in the 
validation cohort was 2.99 ± 0.91 min, ranging from 2.18 to 6.35 min, which was 
reduced by 36.50% ~ 78.20% compared with the fixed acquisition time of 10 min. 
Subjective evaluation showed that acceptable image quality could be obtained at 
3.00 min in the validation group, with an average subjective score of 
3.44 ± 0.53 (kappa = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96 ~ 0.98). Bland-Altman analysis revealed 
good agreement between the proposed regimen and the fixed acquisition time 
cohort.
CONCLUSION: A patient-specific acquisition time regimen was proposed in NET 
patients in development cohort and validated its feasibility in patients with 
NETs in validation cohort by 68 Ga-DOTATATE total-body PET/CT imaging. Based on 
the proposed regimen, the homogenous image quality with optimal acquisition time 
was available independent of body mass."
105,"PURPOSE: The safety of an MRI simulation-guided boost after short-course 
preoperative radiotherapy (SCPRT) for unresectable rectal cancer is assessed 
with a planned interim analysis.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients diagnosed with clinical stage T3-4 or regional 
lymph node-positive disease with positive mesorectal fascia or T4b disease 
evaluated by pelvic MRI were randomly assigned to the SCPRT-boost group (25 Gy 
in 5 fractions plus 4 Gy delivered to the gross tumor volume, followed by four 
cycles of chemotherapy) or preoperative chemoradiotherapy group (50 Gy in 25 
fractions with concurrent chemotherapy). Then, patients received total 
mesorectal excision surgery after preoperative treatment. The primary endpoint 
was the R0 resection rate. The interim analysis was performed when 42 patients 
completed their assigned treatments.
RESULTS: From October 2018 to November 2019, a total of 43 patients were 
enrolled, and 42 patients were included in the interim analysis. During 
preoperative therapy, grade 3 or above toxicities were observed in 10/21 (47.6%) 
patients in the experimental group, and 4/21 (19.0%) patients in the control 
group. A total of 17 (81.0%) and 13 (61.9%) patients in the experimental group 
and control group underwent surgery, respectively. Overall, 65.1% of the 
patients achieved R0 resection in the intention-to-treat analysis. 
Surgery-related adverse complications were observed in 2 patients (11.8%) in the 
experimental group and 1 patient (7.7%) in the control group.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the toxicity of an MRI simulation-guided boost 
after SCPRT for unresectable rectal cancer is acceptable. Thus, this clinical 
trial will be continued as planned."
106,"Patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) require chemotherapy due to 
late detection, rapid disease progression, and low surgical resection rate. 
Tumor cell lines are extremely important in cancer research for drug discovery 
and development. Here, we established and characterized a new intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma cell line, ICC-X1. STR testing confirmed the absence of 
cross-contamination and high similarity to the original tissue. ICC-X1 exhibited 
typical epithelial morphology and formed tumor spheres in the suspension 
culture. The population doubling time was approximately 48 h. The cell line had 
a complex hypotriploid karyotype. The cell line exhibited a strong migration 
ability in vitro and cell inoculation into BALB/c nude mice led to the formation 
of xenografts. Additionally, ICC-X1 cells were sensitive to gemcitabine and 
paclitaxel but resistant to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. RNA sequencing 
revealed that the upregulated cancer-related genes were mainly enriched in 
several signaling pathways, including the TNF signaling pathway, NOD-like 
receptor signaling pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway. The downregulated 
cancer-related genes were mainly enriched in the Rap1 signaling pathway and 
Hippo signaling pathway among other pathways. In conclusion, we have created a 
new ICC cell line derived from Chinese patients. This cell line can be used as a 
preclinical model to study ICC, specifically tumor metastasis and drug 
resistance mechanisms."
107,"BACKGROUND: Linac-based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (fSRT) and 
stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are increasingly being used to manage patients 
with multiple metastases. This retrospective cohort study aimed to compare the 
outcomes after linac-based fSRT and SRS between three patient groups classified 
based on the number of brain metastases (BMs): 1 BM, 2-4 BM, 5-10 BM.
METHODS: The data of consecutive patients with 1-10 BMs treated with fSRT or SRS 
between July 2016 and June 2018 at a single institution were collected. Patients 
with previous whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), concurrent use of WBRT, or 
surgical resection were excluded from the analysis. A total of 176 patients were 
classified into three groups according to the number of BMs: 78, 67, and 31 
patients in 1 BM, 2-4 BM, and 5-10 BM, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier method was 
used to estimate overall survival (OS) curves, and the cumulative incidence with 
competing risks was used to estimate local control (LC), distant intracranial 
failure (DIF), and radiation necrosis (RN).
RESULTS: Median OS was 19.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.2-27.5), 
7.3 months (4.9-11.1), and 5.1 months (4.0-9.0) in 1 BM, 2-4 BM, and 5-10 BM, 
respectively. Compared to 2-4 BM, 1 BM had significantly better OS (hazard ratio 
[HR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.40-0.87; p = 0.0075); however, 5-10 BM had comparable OS (HR 
1.36, 95% CI 0.85-2.19; p = 0.199). There was no significant difference in LC, 
DIF, and RN between tumor number groups, but DIF was lower in 1 BM. RN of grade 
2 or higher occurred in 21 patients (13.5%); grade 4 and 5 RN were not observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The linac-based fSRT and SRS for patients with 5-10 BMs is 
comparable to that for patients with 2-4 BMs in OS, LC, DIF, and RN. It seems 
reasonable to use linac-based fSRT and SRS in patients with 5-10 BMs."
108,"BACKGROUND: Sushi domain-containing protein 4 (SUSD4) is a recently discovered 
protein with unknown cellular functions. We previously revealed that SUSD4 can 
act as complement inhibitor and as a potential tumor suppressor.
METHODS: In a syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer, tumors expressing SUSD4 
had a smaller volume compared with the corresponding mock control tumors. 
Additionally, data from three different expression databases and online analysis 
tools confirm that for breast cancer patients, high mRNA expression of SUSD4 in 
the tumor tissue correlates with a better prognosis. In vitro experiments 
utilized triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (BT-20 and MDA-MB-468) stably 
expressing SUSD4. Moreover, we established a cell line based on BT-20 in which 
the gene for EGFR was knocked out with the CRISPR-Cas9 method.
RESULTS: We discovered that the Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) 
interacts with SUSD4. Furthermore, triple-negative breast cancer cell lines 
stably expressing SUSD4 had higher autophagic flux. The initiation of autophagy 
required the expression of EGFR but not phosphorylation of the receptor. 
Expression of SUSD4 in the breast cancer cells led to activation of the tumor 
suppressor LKB1 and consequently to the activation of AMPKα1. Finally, autophagy 
was initiated after stimulation of the ULK1, Atg14 and Beclin-1 axis in SUSD4 
expressing cells.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study we provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism 
of action whereby SUSD4 acts as an EGFR inhibitor without affecting the 
phosphorylation of the receptor and may potentially influence the recycling of 
EGFR to the plasma membrane."
109,"BACKGROUND: Choroid, ciliary body, and iris melanomas are often grouped as uveal 
melanoma, the most common intraocular primary malignancy. The purpose of the 
current study was to analyze the tumor profile of newly diagnosed cases of 
choroidal melanoma at a reference center in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and to 
investigate the frequency of eyes treated by enucleation that could have been 
treated with brachytherapy if available in the service.
METHODS: Medical records of patients referred to our service with initial 
diagnostic hypothesis of choroidal melanoma from July 2014 to June 2020 were 
analysed on demographics, diagnosis confirmation, tumor measurement by 
ultrasonography and established treatment. Data were evaluated on clinical and 
demographic characteristics as age, sex, affected eye, ultrasound parameters, 
and treatment management of patients with clinically diagnosed choroidal 
melanoma. Among the patients submitted to enucleation, we investigated how many 
could have been selected to receive brachytherapy.
RESULTS: From the 102 patients referred with the choroidal melanoma diagnosis 
hypothesis, 70 (68.62%) were confirmed. Mean measurements from the tumors in 
millimetres were: 9.19 ± 3.69 at height and 12.97 ± 3.09 by 13.30 ± 3.30 at 
basal. A total of 48 cases (68.57%) were enucleated, 8 (11.43%) were treated by 
brachytherapy in a different service, and 14 patients (20.00%) returned for 
enucleation at their original referral center. Out of the 48 patients 
enucleated, 26 (54.17%) could have been selected to brachytherapy treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a late diagnosis of choroidal melanoma cases 
referred to our service. Most enucleated cases could have been treated with 
brachytherapy if it was broadly available at the national public health 
insurance. Further public health political efforts should focus on early 
diagnosis and better quality of life post-treatment for oncologic patients."
110,"BACKGROUND: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is a common malignant tumor of the female 
reproductive system, often accompanied by lymph node metastasis. Artificial 
vascular implantation is a common surgical treatment for mediastinal tumors and 
abdominal aortic aneurysms but is rarely used in gynecological surgery.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old female patient was first admitted to the 
hospital in January 2018 due to ""irregular vaginal bleeding over 3 months"". CT 
showed a mass in the uterine cavity, and several swollen lymph nodes in the 
retroperitoneum and pelvic cavity. The initial diagnosis was an endometrial 
malignant tumor. We performed radical endometrial cancer surgery with parallel 
resection of inferior vena cava, abdominal aorta, bilateral common iliac 
arteries, bilateral external iliac arteries, and artificial vessel replacement, 
which was successful, with good postoperative recovery and no lesion progression 
at 3 years postoperative follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This is an early case of gynecological clinical use of prostheses. 
Through multidisciplinary cooperation, the surgical resection rate of patients 
with EC in radical surgery was improved without serious fatal complications and 
achieved a high long-term postoperative survival rate."
111,"BACKGROUND: Itaconic acid, an unsaturated C5 dicarbonic acid, has significant 
market demand and prospects. It has numerous biological functions, such as 
anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative in medicine, and is an 
essential renewable platform chemical in industry. However, the development of 
industrial itaconic acid production by Aspergillus terreus, the current standard 
production strain, is hampered by the unavoidable drawbacks of that species. 
Developing a highly efficient cell factory is essential for the sustainable and 
green production of itaconic acid.
RESULTS: This study employed combinatorial engineering strategies to construct 
Escherichia coli cells to produce itaconic acid efficiently. Two essential genes 
(cis-aconitate decarboxylase (CAD) encoding gene cadA and aconitase (ACO) 
encoding gene acn) employed various genetic constructs and plasmid combinations 
to create 12 recombination E. coli strains to be screened. Among them, E. coli 
BL-CAC exhibited the highest titer with citrate as substrate, and the induction 
and reaction conditions were further systematically optimized. Subsequently, 
employing enzyme evolution to optimize rate-limiting enzyme CAD and synthesizing 
protein scaffolds to co-localize ACO and CAD were used to improve itaconic acid 
biosynthesis efficiency. Under the optimized reaction conditions combined with 
the feeding control strategy, itaconic acid titer reached 398.07 mM (51.79 g/L) 
of engineered E. coli BL-CAR470E-DS/A-CS cells as a catalyst with the highest 
specific production of 9.42 g/g(DCW) among heterologous hosts at 48 h.
CONCLUSIONS: The excellent catalytic performance per unit biomass shows the 
potential for high-efficiency production of itaconic acid and effective 
reduction of catalytic cell consumption. This study indicates that it is 
necessary to continuously explore engineering strategies to develop 
high-performance cell factories to break through the existing bottleneck and 
achieve the economical commercial production of itaconic acid."
112,"INTRODUCTION: Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) and T 
cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) have overlapping 
histological features that make their diagnosis challenging. Insulin-like growth 
factor II mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) is a recently proposed diagnostic marker 
for Hodgkin's lymphoma. The aim of this study was to determine the ability of 
IMP3 in differentiating NLPHL from THRLBCL.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
blocks from 56 patients (28 NLPHL and 28 large B cell lymphoma (LBCL, including 
16 THRLBCL and 12 DLBCL, NOS) cases based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) were 
included. Sample sections were stained for IMP3 using IHC method. Moderate to 
strong staining in at least 10% of tumor cells was considered positive IMP3 
expression.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 41.25 ± 16.08 years old. The majority 
of the patients were male. There was a significant age difference between NLPHL 
(34.61 ± 16.44 years old) and LBCL (47.89 ± 12.85 years) groups (p = 0.001). No 
significant difference was seen in gender and site between NLPHL and LBCL 
groups. The expression of IMP3 was mainly strong in LBCL group, while it was 
heterogeneously distributed among NLPHL samples ranging from weak to strong 
(p < 0.001). It was determined that strong IMP3 expression at 55.00% can 
differentiate LBCL from NLPHL with 71.4% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that IMP3 may be a good complement in 
differentiating NLPHL cases from THRLBCL."
113,"Cancer is a heterogeneous disease with multifaceted drug resistance mechanisms 
(e.g., tumour microenvironment [TME], tumour heterogeneity, and immune evasion). 
Natural products are interesting repository of bioactive molecules, especially 
those with anticancer activities. Prodigiosin, a red pigment produced by 
Serratia marcescens, possesses inherent anticancer characteristics, showing 
interesting antitumour activities in different cancers (e.g., breast, gastric) 
with low or without harmful effects on normal cells. The present review 
discusses the potential role of prodigiosin in modulating and reprogramming the 
metabolism of the various immune cells in the TME, such as T and B lymphocytes, 
tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), natural killer (NK) cells, and 
tumour-associated dendritic cells (TADCs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
(MDSCs) which in turn might introduce as an immunomodulator in cancer therapy."
114,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Index cholecystectomy is insufficient for curing T3 
incidental gallbladder cancer (IGC), and once residual cancer (RC) is found, the 
prognosis is often poor. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect 
of RC on the prognosis and the optimal choice of adjuvant therapy for R0 
reresection patients with T3 IGC.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with T3 IGC who 
underwent radical reresection from January 2013 to December 2018. RC was defined 
as histologically proven cancer at reresection. Demographics and tumour 
treatment-related variables were analysed in correlation with RC and survival. 
Adjuvant (Adj) chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was correlated with overall survival (OS) 
and disease-free survival (DFS).
RESULTS: Of the 167 patients with IGC who underwent surgery, 102 underwent 
radical extended resection. Thirty-two (31.4%) RCs were found. Hepatic side 
tumours (T3h) and both side tumours (T3h + T3p) were associated with the 
presence of RC. In multivariate analysis, RC and lymph node metastasis were 
independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS (P < 0.05). RC was associated with 
a significantly shorter median OS (20 vs. 53 months; P < 0.01) and DFS (11 vs. 
40 months; P < 0.001) despite R0 resection. For R0 reresection patients with RC 
and/or lymph node metastasis, Adj CRT significantly improved OS (P = 0.024).
CONCLUSION: Residual cancer and lymphatic metastasis are important factors for 
the poor prognosis of T3 IGC despite R0 resection, and these patients should 
actively receive adjuvant therapy."
115,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has insidious onset, late clinical diagnosis and 
high recurrence rate, which leads to poor quality of patient life. Therefore, it 
is necessary to further explore the pathogenesis and therapy targets of NPC. 
BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase B (BUB1B) was found to be 
up-regulated in a variety of cancers, but only two previous study showed that 
BUB1B was overexpressed in NPC and the sample size was small. The clinical role 
of BUB1B expression and its underlying mechanism in NPC require more in-depth 
research. Immunohistochemical samples and public RNA-seq data indicated that 
BUB1B protein and mRNA expression levels were up-regulated in NPC, and summary 
receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that BUB1B expression level 
had a strong ability to distinguish NPC tissues from non-NPC tissues. Gene 
ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes were performed and revealed 
that BUB1B and its related genes were mainly involved in cell cycle and DNA 
replication. Protein- Protein Interaction were built to interpret the BUB1B 
molecular mechanism. Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) could be the upstream 
regulation factor of BUB1B, which was verified by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation 
Sequencing samples. In summary, BUB1B was highly expressed in NPC, and HDAC2 may 
affect cell cycle by regulating BUB1B to promote cancer progression."
116,"PURPOSE: The combination of taxanes and anthracyclines is still the mainstay of 
chemotherapy for early breast cancer. Capecitabine is an active drug with a 
favorable toxicity profile, showing strong anti-tumor activity against 
metastatic breast cancer. This trial assessed the efficacy and safety of the TX 
regimen (docetaxel and capecitabine) and compared it with the TE (docetaxel and 
epirubicin) regimen in locally advanced or high risk early HER2-negative breast 
cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted at five 
academic centers in China. Eligible female patients were randomly assigned (1:1) 
to the TX (docetaxel 75 mg/m2 d1 plus capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice d1-14, q3w) 
or TE (docetaxel 75 mg/m2 d1 plus epirubicin 75 mg/m2 d1, q3w) groups for four 
cycles. The primary endpoint was a pathological complete response in the breast 
(pCR). Secondary endpoints included pCR in the breast and axilla, invasive 
disease-free survival (iDFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.
RESULTS: Between September 1, 2012, and December 31, 2018, 113 HER2-negative 
patients were randomly assigned to the study groups (TX: n = 54; TE: n = 59). In 
the primary endpoint analysis, 14 patients in the TX group achieved a pCR, and 
nine patients in the TE group achieved a pCR (25.9% vs. 15.3%), with a not 
significant difference of 10.6% (95% CI -6.0-27.3%; P = 0.241). In a subgroup 
with high Ki-67 score, TX increased the pCR rate by 24.2% (95% CI 2.2-46.1%; 
P = 0.029). At the end of the 69-month median follow-up period, both groups had 
equivalent iDFS and OS rates. TX was associated with a higher incidence of 
hand-foot syndrome and less alopecia, with a manageable toxicity profile.
CONCLUSION: The anthracycline-free TX regimen yielded comparable pCR and 
long-term survival rates to the TE regimen. Thus, this anthracycline-free 
regimen could be considered in selected patients.

117,"Regulatory T (Treg) cells have an immunosuppressive function and highly express 
the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 in the tumor microenvironment; however, the 
function of PD-1 in tumor-infiltrating (TI) Treg cells remains controversial. 
Here, we showed that conditional deletion of PD-1 in Treg cells delayed tumor 
progression. In Pdcd1fl/flFoxp3eGFP-Cre-ERT2(+/-) mice, in which both 
PD-1-expressing and PD-1-deficient Treg cells coexisted in the same tissue 
environment, conditional deletion of PD-1 in Treg cells resulted in impairment 
of the proliferative and suppressive capacity of TI Treg cells. PD-1 antibody 
therapy reduced the TI Treg cell numbers, but did not directly restore the 
cytokine production of TI CD8+ T cells in TC-1 lung cancer. Single-cell analysis 
indicated that PD-1 signaling promoted lipid metabolism, proliferation and 
suppressive pathways in TI Treg cells. These results suggest that PD-1 ablation 
or inhibition can enhance antitumor immunity by weakening Treg cell lineage 
stability and metabolic fitness in the tumor microenvironment."
118,"Pregnancy is a remarkable time of pronounced growth and development of the 
fetus. Benign pathologies outside of the uterus, including those containing 
hormonally responsive tissue which undergo physiologic changes and other 
incidentally identified lesions, may mimic malignancy on clinical evaluation and 
imaging. A detailed history and physical exam, ultrasound and non-contrast 
magnetic resonance imaging features and comparison with prior imaging if 
available may help to narrow the list of potential differential diagnoses. 
Follow-up imaging in the postpartum period is often vital to confirm benignity 
and, in some cases, sampling to confirm the diagnosis is necessary. This review 
will cover the clinical, pathological and multimodality imaging features of 
numerous potential mimickers of cancer in the setting of pregnancy organized by 
organ systems. The goal is to better equip abdominal radiologists to accurately 
identify benign disease and help guide further imaging or follow-up 
recommendations to avoid unnecessarily aggressive intervention and improve 
patient care."
119,"Limited data exist regarding the associations between TROP-2 protein expression, 
clinical-pathological characteristics, and outcome in triple-negative breast 
cancer (TNBC). TROP-2 expression was determined for patients diagnosed with TNBC 
between 2000 and 2017 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (ab227689, Abcam) on whole 
slide tumor sections, and assessed as continuous and categorical variables 
(H-score high, 201-300, medium 100-200 and low < 100). We investigated the 
prognostic value of TROP-2 expression for relapse and survival, associations 
between TROP-2 expression and baseline patient and tumor characteristics, 
stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs), androgen receptor (AR), 
standardized mitotic index (SMI) and pathological complete response (pCR, in 
patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy) were assessed. We included 685 patients 
with a median age at diagnosis of 54 years (range 22-90 years). After median 
follow-up of 9.6 years, 17.5% of patients experienced distant relapse. TROP-2 
expression was high, medium and low in 97 (16.5%), 149 (25.3%) and 343 (58.2%) 
of patients, respectively. The presence of LVI, associated DCIS, nodal 
involvement, apocrine histology and AR expression were correlated with higher 
TROP-2 levels. There were no associations between TROP-2 expression and sTILs, 
time-to-event outcomes, or pCR rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. TROP-2 
expression is not associated with sTILs level and has no prognostic value in our 
cohort of stage 1-3 TNBC. However, an association with histotype and AR 
expression was found, suggesting a histotype specific TROP-2 expression pattern 
with highest expression in apocrine subtype, warranting further research."
120,"Bone marrow studies currently provide a lot of valuable information in the 
diagnostics of hematological diseases including hematopoietic stem cells 
disorders. Our studies on low-molecular weight organic compounds in bone marrow 
stem cell niche in various pathogenic conditions, revealed relatively high 
variability of histamine levels in different groups of hematological diseases. 
It was also found that serotonin levels were significantly lower than those 
typically measured in peripheral blood as well as many have the influence on 
stem cells proliferative potential. This paper presents findings from 
quantitative and statistical analyses of histamine and serotonin levels. Bone 
marrow collected from patients undergoing routine diagnostic procedures for 
hematological diseases and receiving inpatient treatment were analyzed. 
Histamine and serotonin levels were measured using hydrophilic interaction 
liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Obtained 
data were analyzed statistically and correlated with the diagnosed groups of 
hematological diseases and the parameters of complete blood counts. Histamine 
was found in all tested samples, including those from patients without 
malignancy, and the reported levels were comparable to the reference values in 
blood. This observation allows us to assume that bone marrow cells can produce 
and accumulate histamine. Moreover, the statistical analysis revealed a 
significant relationship between histamine levels and diagnosed mastocytosis, 
and between histamine levels and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Different results 
were obtained for serotonin, and its concentrations in most cases were below the 
limit of quantification of the method used (< 0.2 ng/mL), which can only be 
compared to peripheral blood plasma. In a few cases, significantly higher 
serotonin levels were observed and it concerned diseases associated with an 
increased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow."
121,"BACKGROUND: The emerging use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) in the 
management of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (CAT) is significantly 
improving therapeutic adherence and quality of life. Despite this, many 
conditions can restrict the therapeutic index of these drugs. For all these 
reasons the latest guidelines recommend the use of heparins in the treatment of 
CAT as the preferred treatment in some clinical settings.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the efficacy and the safety of DOAC, in terms of 
recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and major bleeding (MB), as a composite 
primary outcome. Mortality and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) 
were evaluated as secondary outcomes.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 209 patients to compare the 
effects of DOAC versus heparins for the treatment of CAT. 127 patients with a 
high bleeding risk neoplasia were enrolled.
RESULTS: A primary-outcome event occurred in 11.3% of patients treated with 
heparins and in 10.5% treated with DOAC (Relative Risk 0.92; 95% CI 0.42-2.01, 
p = 0.84). Recurrent VTE occurred in 6.1% in the heparins group and in 8.4% in 
the DOAC group (RR 1.37; 95% CI 0.51-3.64, p = 0.52). MB occurred in 5.2% in the 
heparins group and in 2.1% in the DOAC group (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.08-1.93, 
p = 0.25).
CONCLUSIONS: DOAC seem to be as effective and safe as heparins in the treatment 
of CAT. Most bleeding events occurred in patients with high-risk bleeding 
neoplasms regardless of the type of anticoagulant. Considering the 
characteristics and satisfaction of patients using DOAC in this setting, this 
approach should be considered as a first choice."
122,"PURPOSE: Rectal or anal canal adenocarcinoma with inguinal lymph node metastasis 
(ILNM) is rare and is associated with poor prognostic outcomes. This study aimed 
to elucidate the clinical significance of neoadjuvant therapy followed by 
selective inguinal lymph node dissection and total mesorectal excision for 
rectal or anal canal adenocarcinoma with clinically suspected ILNM.
METHODS: This study enrolled 15 consecutive patients who underwent neoadjuvant 
therapy and curative resection for rectal or anal canal adenocarcinoma with 
clinically suspected ILNM between 2005 and 2019 at a single institution. 
Inguinal lymph node dissection was selectively performed on the side of 
suspected metastasis before neoadjuvant therapy. Short- and long-term outcomes 
were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Out of the15 patients, 11 were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation, 
three with chemotherapy, and one with chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy. 
Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans were performed 
after neoadjuvant therapy in 14 patients. Five patients had negative FDG 
accumulation in inguinal lymph nodes on FDG-PET scan, and their inguinal lymph 
nodes were also pathologically negative for metastasis. Of the nine patients who 
had positive FDG accumulation, four had pathologically positive inguinal lymph 
nodes. Seven patients (46.7%) had inguinal seroma postoperatively. 
Five-year-overall survival was 77.5%, and 5-year-relapse-free survival was 
64.2%. No patient had a recurrence in the inguinal region.
CONCLUSION: In patients with rectal or anal canal adenocarcinoma associated with 
clinical ILNM, radical resection with neoadjuvant therapy provides a good 
long-term survival."
123,"To identify potential gaps in attitudes, knowledge, and practices towards 
LGBTQ2S + patients with a cancer diagnosis, a survey of clinical providers (CP) 
and allied health staff (AHS) was conducted to identify areas of improvement and 
guide development for future education and training. A previously published, 
validated survey was adapted at the direction of a LGBTQ2S + Patient and Family 
Advisory Council, and modified to include AHS. The survey was disseminated to 
all faculty and staff, and was adapted to the participants' self-identified 
level of patient interaction/care responsibilities. Subsections consisted of 
questions related to demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and practice behaviors 
towards participating in the care of LGBTQ2S + patients. Results were quantified 
using stratified analysis and an attitude summary measure. Of the 311 
respondents, 179 self-identified as CPs and 132 as AHS. There was high agreement 
in comfort treating or assisting LGBTQ2S + patients by CP and AHS respondents, 
respectively. CPs possessed significantly higher knowledge regarding 
LGBTQ2S + health when compared to AHS; however, there remained high percentages 
of ""neutral"" and ""do not know or prefer not to answer"" responses regardless of 
clinical role. There was high agreement regarding the importance of knowing a 
patient's gender identity (GI) and pronouns (CP vs. AHS; 76.9% vs. 73.5% and 
89.4% vs. 84.1%, respectively), whereas patient's sexual orientation and sex 
assigned at birth (CP vs. AHS; 51.1% vs. 53.5% and 58.6% vs. 62.9%, 
respectively) were viewed as less important. There was high interest in 
receiving education regarding the unique needs of LGBTQ2S + patients regardless 
of clinical role. Stratified analyses of CPs revealed early-career physicians 
(< 1-5 years from graduation) expressed higher interest in additional education 
and involvement with LGBTQ2S + -focused trainings when compared to mid- and 
late-career providers. This is the first study, to our knowledge, assessing the 
attitudes, knowledge, and practices of CPs and AHS regarding the care of 
LGBTQ2S + patients with cancer. Overall, there was high comfort 
treating/assisting LGBTQ2S + patients among CP and AHS respondents, 
respectively; yet, both groups possessed significant gaps in LGBTQ2S + -focused 
knowledge."
124,"Post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence is one of the greatest concerns for both 
patients and urologists. The aim of this study is to elucidate simple and 
reliable factors contributing to early recovery of urinary continence (UC) and 
to develop a prediction model for early continence recovery after robot-assisted 
laparoscopic non-nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (non-NS RARP). A 
retrospective analysis of 212 consecutive patients who underwent non-NS RARP by 
a single surgeon was carried out. Early recovery of urinary continence was 
defined as using no pads or one security pad per day within 1 month. 
Preoperative membranous urethral length (MUL) was measured on MRI, and the 
urinary continence at the standing position (UCSP) after removal of the catheter 
was examined during cystourethrography 6 days after surgery. Multivariable 
analysis was performed to detect predictive and postoperative factors associated 
with early recovery of urinary continence. The early continence recovery rate 
was 56.1%. Multivariable analysis revealed that MUL ≥ 13 mm, UCSP, and age ≤ 67 
were the independent factors for early continence recovery. Early recovery rates 
were 97.1% for good risk, 76.3% for intermediate risk, and 28.4% for poor risk 
when divided into three risk groups by the sum score of three independent 
factors. Preoperative MUL, UCSP, and age are independent predictors of early 
recovery of UC in non-NS RARP, and our simple prediction model with the 
combination of the three factors could be a useful tool in clinical practice."
125,"Over the last decade, the use of targeted therapies and immune therapies led to

decisions. The genomic profiling of tumors and the molecular characterization of 
the tumor microenvironment gradually became essential steps in exploring and 
identifying markers that can enhance patient selection to facilitate treatment 
personalization and narrow down therapy options. The advent of innovative 
diagnostic platforms, such as next-generation sequencing and plasma genotyping 
(also known as liquid biopsies), has aided in this quest. Currently, programmed 
cell death ligand 1 expression remains the most recognized and fully validated 
predictive biomarker of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Other markers 
such as tumor mutational burden, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, driver 
mutations, and other molecular elements of the tumor microenvironment bear the 
potential to be predictive tools; however, the majority are still 
investigational. In this review, we describe the advances noted thus far on 
currently validated as well as novel emerging biomarkers that have the potential 
to guide the use of immunotherapy agents in the management of non-small cell 
lung cancer."
126,"BACKGROUND: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) plus radiotherapy (BCS + RT) has 
been shown to improve survival compared with mastectomy in patients with early 
breast cancer; however, whether this superiority is maintained in breast cancer 
patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) is unclear. We evaluated and 
compared the survival outcomes after BCS + RT and mastectomy in Korean women 
with breast cancer treated with NCT.
METHODS: We evaluated 1641 patients who received NCT before surgery (BCS or 
mastectomy). We performed propensity score matching to minimize potential bias 
due to factors other than the surgical method and compared the 5-year, 
disease-free survival (DFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and 
overall survival (OS) rates before and after exact matching.
RESULTS: Among the 1641 patients, 839 (51.1%) underwent BCS + RT and 802 (48.9%) 
underwent mastectomy. Patients who underwent mastectomy had larger tumors and 
more frequently had positive nodes. For BCS+RT and mastectomy, the unadjusted 
5-year DFS, 5-year DMFS, and 5-year OS rates were 87.0% and 73.1%, 89.5% and 
77.0%, and 91.8% and 81.0%, respectively (all p < 0.05 = 0.000). After PSM, 
5-year DFS, 5-year DMFS, and 5-year OS rates for BCS + RT and mastectomy were 
87.6% and 69.1%, 89.7% and 76.0%, and 89.1% and 75.7%, respectively (all p < 
0.05). In both unadjusted and adjusted analyses accounting for various 
confounding factors, BCS + RT was significantly associated with improved DFS (p 
< 0.05), DMFS (p < 0.05), and OS (p < 0.05) rates compared with mastectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: BCS + RT does not impair DFS and OS in patients treated with NCT. 
Tumor biology and treatment response are significant prognostic indicators. Our 
results suggest that BCS + RT may be preferred in most breast cancer patients 
when both BCS and mastectomy are suitable."
127,"Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning 
regimens have expanded use of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation 
(HCT) in AML to include older and medically less-fit patients, but relative 
efficacies and toxicities remain poorly defined. Here, we analyzed outcomes from 
343 adults transplanted in remission after RIC (n = 137) or NMA (n = 206) 
conditioning between 2006 and 2021. The characteristics of RIC and NMA HCT 
patients were similar except that RIC patients were younger and their time 
between most recent remission achievement and allografting was shorter. There 
were no significant differences in relapse risk, relapse-free survival (RFS), 
overall survival (OS), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) between RIC and NMA HCT 
patients, both overall (relapse: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.80, P = 0.27; RFS: 
HR = 0.93, P = 0.61; OS: HR = 0.93, P = 0.66; NRM: HR = 1.13, P = 0.59) and when 
patients were stratified by pre-HCT measurable residual disease (MRD) status. 
After multivariable adjustment, there was no statistically significant 
association between conditioning intensity and relapse (HR = 0.69, P = 0.088), 
RFS (HR = 0.86, P = 0.37), OS (HR = 0.89, P = 0.49), or NRM (HR = 1.37, 
P = 0.19). In this non-randomized cohort of adults undergoing allografting for 
AML in first or second remission at our center, we could not detect 
statistically significant differences in outcomes between those assigned to RIC 
and those assigned to NMA conditioning."
128,"Development of colorectal cancer (CRC) is regulated by a series of genetic and 
microenvironmental alterations. Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) is a secreted 
glycoprotein that is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and 
modulates inflammation. However, the role of OLFM4 in CRC is uncertain. Here we 
aimed to explore the function of OLFM4 in CRC in vivo and in vitro. The mRNA 
expression of OLFM4 was up-regulated in precursor lesions with dysplasia or 
ulcerative colitis but was reduced in CRC. OLFM4 neutralizing antibody 
suppressed inflammation-mediated early-stage CRC formation in an AOM/DSS 
colitis-associated cancer model. OLFM4 knockdown cells exhibited increased cell 
proliferation and motility in vitro and in vivo. Ablation of OLFM4 increased 
tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft experiments. In addition, OLFM4 
knockdown cells showed elevated expression of colon cancer stem cell markers 
including CD133, resulting in increased metastasis via epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition signaling. This study demonstrated that OLFM4 regulates inflammation 
and cancer progression differently; ablation of OLFM4 promotes cancer metastasis 
via stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results suggest a new 
route for controlling cancer progression and metastasis."
129,"INTRODUCTION: Variants in the BRCA1/2 genes are responsible for familial breast 
cancer. Numerous studies showed a different spectrum of BRCA variants among 
breast cancer patients of different Ethnicity origin. In the available 
literature, no previous research has focused on breast cancer-associated 
variants among the Khakass people (the indigenous people of the Russian 
Federation).
METHODS: Twenty-six Khakass breast cancer patients were enrolled in the study. 
Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and used to prepare libraries using 
a Hereditary Cancer Solution kit. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed 
using the MiSeq System (Illumina, USA).
RESULTS: In our study, 12% of patients (3/26) carried a single pathogenic 
variant; 54% of patients (14/26) carried variants of uncertain significance 
(VUS) or conflicting variants; and 35% of patients (9/26) did not carry any 
clinically significant variants. Germline pathogenic variant in the ATM gene 
(rs780619951, NC_000011.10:g.108259022C > T) was identified in two unrelated 
patients with a family history of cancer (7.6%, 2/26). The pathogenic truncating 
variant in the ATM gene (p. R805* or c.2413C > T) leads to the nonfunctional 
version of the protein. This variant has been earlier reported in individuals 
with a family history of breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study describes the germline variant in the ATM gene 
associated with breast cancer in Khakass women of North Asia."
130,"Dysregulation of inflammasome activation induces chronic and excess inflammation 
resulting in several disorders, such as metabolic disorders and cancers. Thus, 
screening for its regulator derived from natural materials has been conducted 
progressively. JC2-11 (JC) was designed to enhance the antioxidant activity 
based on a chalcone, which is abundant in edible plants and a precursor of 
flavonoids. This study examined the effects of JC on inflammasome activation in 
human and murine macrophages. JC inhibited the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β 
and lactate dehydrogenases, and the cleavage of caspase-1 and gasdermin D in 
response to the tested activators (i.e., NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, and non-canonical 
inflammasome triggers). In addition, JC attenuated IL-1β secretion from 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected mice, an inflammasome-mediating disease model. 
Mechanistically, JC blocked the expression of the inflammasome components during 
the priming step of the inflammasome, and interrupted the production of 
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. In addition, JC inhibited the activity of 
caspase-1. In conclusion, JC may be a candidate pan-inflammasome inhibitor."
131,"After smoking, residential radon is the second risk factor of lung cancer in 
general population and the first in never-smokers. Previous studies have 
analyzed radon attributable lung cancer mortality for some countries. We aim to 
identify, summarize, and critically analyze the available data regarding the 
mortality burden of lung cancer due to radon, performing a quality assessment of 
the papers included, and comparing the results from different countries. We 
performed a systematic scoping review using the main biomedical databases. We 
included original studies with attributable mortality data related to radon 
exposure. We selected studies according to specific inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. PRISMA 2020 methodology and PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews 
requirements were followed. Data were abstracted using a standardized data sheet 
and a tailored scale was used to assess quality. We selected 24 studies 
describing radon attributable mortality derived from 14 different countries. 
Overall, 13 studies used risk models based on cohorts of miners, 8 used risks 
from residential radon case-control studies and 3 used both risk model options. 
Radon geometric mean concentration ranged from 11 to 83 Becquerels per cubic 
meter (Bq/m3) and the population attributable fraction (PAF) ranged from 0.2 to 
26%. Studies performed in radon prone areas obtained the highest attributable 
mortality. High-quality publications reported PAF ranging from 3 to 12% for 
residential risk sources and from 7 to 25% for miner risk sources. Radon PAF for 
lung cancer mortality varies widely between studies. A large part of the 
variation is due to differences in the risk source used and the conceptual 
description of radon exposure assumed. A common methodology should be described 
and used from now on to improve the communication of these results."
132,"Transcriptional addiction is recognized as a valid therapeutic target in cancer, 
whereby the dependency of cancer cells on oncogenic transcriptional regulators 
may be pharmacologically exploited. However, a comprehensive understanding of 
the key factors within the transcriptional machinery that might afford a useful 
therapeutic window remains elusive. Herein, we present a cross-omics 
investigation into the functional specialization of the transcriptional cyclin 
dependent kinases (tCDKs) through analysis of high-content genetic dependency, 
gene expression, patient survival, and drug response datasets. This analysis 
revealed specialization among tCDKs in terms of contributions to cancer cell 
fitness, clinical prognosis, and interaction with oncogenic signaling pathways. 
CDK7 and CDK9 stand out as the most relevant targets, albeit through distinct 
mechanisms of oncogenicity and context-dependent contributions to cancer 
survival and drug sensitivity. Genetic ablation of CDK9, but not CDK7, mimics 
the effect on cell viability the loss of key components of the transcriptional 
machinery. Pathway analysis of genetic co-dependency and drug sensitivity data 
show CDK7 and CDK9 have distinct relationships with major oncogenic signatures, 
including MYC and E2F targets, oxidative phosphorylation, and the unfolded 
protein response. Altogether, these results inform the improved design of 
therapeutic strategies targeting tCDKs in cancer."
133,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) improve the prognosis of patients with 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). We conducted a retrospective cohort 
study using cancer registries linked with health utilization data in Japan and 
Taiwan to assess TKI usage in older and non-older patients. Patients diagnosed 
with GIST (2012-2014) were categorized into the following: adjuvant and 
advanced/metastatic settings. The duration and patterns of imatinib therapy were 
compared between the older (aged ≥ 75 years) and non-older (< 75 years) groups. 
We included 232 Japanese and 492 Taiwanese patients in the adjuvant setting, and 
235 Japanese and 401 Taiwanese patients in the advanced/metastatic setting. 
Older patients had higher proportions of starting with lower doses 
(< 400 mg/day) than the non-older patients (adjuvant: 22.5% vs. 4.3% [Japan]; 
22.5% vs. 10.9% [Taiwan]; advanced/metastatic: 29.6% vs. 7.2% [Japan]; 32.6% vs. 
8.1% [Taiwan]; all p < 0.01). The median time to stop imatinib was shorter in 
the older than in the non-older patients (adjuvant: 301 vs. 975 days [Japan], 
366 vs. 1028 days [Taiwan]; advanced/metastatic: 423 vs. 542 days [Japan]; 366.5 
vs. 837 days [Taiwan]). More older patients with GIST tended to have TKIs at a 
lower initial dose and a shorter imatinib duration than the non-older patients."
134,"Treatment of oncological pain is complex and requires a multidisciplinary 
management approach between oncology services and pain units. Although 
significant improvements have been achieved in the treatment and overall 
survival of cancer patients, the management of oncological pain has not followed 
the same directions. Many patients are not referred to pain units even though 
they could benefit from it. The purpose of this Delphi survey was to map the 
current situation in the management of cancer pain, identify barriers and 
propose recommendations to improve its management by emphasizing the importance 
of collaboration and coordination between oncology services and pain units. A 
survey among members with recognized experience in the management of oncology 
patients and oncological pain was held based on the Delphi method principles. 
The experts were asked to vote preselected statements on cancer pain management 
in two rounds and conclusions and recommendations were formulated based on the 
consensus reached for each statement. Barriers and areas for improvement were 
identified: need of multidisciplinary management approach, effective 
communication between oncology services and pain units, timely referral of 
cancer patients to pain units, training of health care professionals dealing 
with cancer aspects and identification of those patients that could benefit from 
a multidisciplinary management of their oncological disease. The experts issued 
recommendations targeting the identified barriers and areas for improvement by 
defining the service requirements of hospital and units treating cancer pain 
patients, establishing referral pathways necessities and adopted measures to 
improve the care of cancer patients."
135,"Cellular senescence caused by oncogenic stimuli is associated with the 
development of various age-related pathologies through the senescence-associated 
secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP is mediated by the activation of cytoplasmic 
nucleic acid sensors. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the 
accumulation of nucleotide ligands in senescent cells is unclear. In this study, 
we revealed that the expression of RNaseH2A, which removes ribonucleoside 
monophosphates (rNMPs) from the genome, is regulated by E2F transcription 
factors, and it decreases during cellular senescence. Residual rNMPs cause 
genomic DNA fragmentation and aberrant activation of cytoplasmic nucleic acid 
sensors, thereby provoking subsequent SASP factor gene expression in senescent 
cells. In addition, RNaseH2A expression was significantly decreased in aged 
mouse tissues and cells from individuals with Werner syndrome. Furthermore, 
RNaseH2A degradation using the auxin-inducible degron system induced the 
accumulation of nucleotide ligands and induction of certain tumourigenic 
SASP-like factors, promoting the metastatic properties of colorectal cancer 
cells. Our results indicate that RNaseH2A downregulation provokes SASP through 
nucleotide ligand accumulation, which likely contributes to the pathological 
features of senescent, progeroid, and cancer cells."
136,"Dampened immunity and impaired wound healing in diabetic patients may lead to 
diabetic foot ulcer disease, which is the leading cause of limb amputations and 
hospitalization. On the other hand, cancer is the most significant cause of 
mortality globally, accounting for over 10 million fatalities in 2020, or nearly 
one in every six deaths. Plants and herbs have been used to treat chronic 
diseases due to their essential pharmaceutical attributes, such as mitigating 
drug resistance, ameliorating systemic toxicities, reducing the need for 
synthetic chemotherapeutic agents,and strengthening the immune system. The 
present study has been designed to evaluate the effects of Tribulus terrestris 
on wound healing, cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory responses against HepG-2 liver 
cancer cell line. Two solvents (methanol and ethanol) were used for root 
extraction of T. terrestris. The wound healing potential of the extracts was 
studied on diabetic cell culture line by scratch assay. The anti-oxidant and 
cytotoxic potentials were evaluated by in vitro assays against HepG2 cell line. 
The methanolic root extract resulted in the coverage of robust radical 
scavenging or maximum inhibition of 66.72%,potent cytotoxic activity or reduced 
cell viability of 40.98%, and anti-diabetic activity having mighty α-glucosidase 
inhibition of 50.16% at a concentration of 80 μg/ml. Significant reduction in 
the levels of LDH leakage (56.38%), substantial ROS (48.45%) and SOD (72.13%) 
activities were recorededMoreover, gene expression analysis demonstrated the 
down-regulation of inflammatory markers (TNF-α, MMP-9, Bcl-2, and AFP) in HepG-2 
cells when treated with T. terresteris methanolic extract as compared to stress. 
Furthermore, the down-regulation of inflammatory markers was validated through 
ELISA-mediated protein estimation of IL-1β and TNF-α. It is expected that this 
study will lay a foundation and lead to the development of efficient but 
low-cost, natural herbs extract-based dressing/ointment for diabetic patients 
and identify potential drug metabolites to treat out-of-whack inflammatory 
responses involved in cancer onset, progression, and metastasis."
137,"Myocardin-related transcription factors A and B (MRTFs) are coactivators of 
Serum Response Factor (SRF), which controls fundamental biological processes 
such as cell growth, migration, and differentiation. MRTF and SRF 
transcriptional activity play an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) growth, which represents the second leading cause of cancer-related 
mortality in humans worldwide. We, therefore, searched for druggable targets in 
HCC that regulate MRTF/SRF transcriptional activity and can be exploited 
therapeutically for HCC therapy. We identified the G protein-coupled 
lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) as a novel interaction partner of 
MRTF-A and Filamin A (FLNA) using fluorescence resonance energy transfer-(FRET) 
and proximity ligation assay (PLA) in vitro in HCC cells and in vivo in 
organoids. We found that LPAR1 promotes FLNA phosphorylation at S2152 which 
enhances the complex formation of FLNA and MRTF-A, actin polymerization, and 
MRTF transcriptional activity. Pharmacological blockade or depletion of LPAR1 
prevents FLNA phosphorylation and complex formation with MRTF-A, resulting in 
reduced MRTF/SRF target gene expression and oncogene-induced senescence. Thus, 
inhibition of the LPAR1-FLNA-MRTF-A interaction represents a promising strategy 
for HCC therapy."
138,"Metabolic reprogramming is involved in the pathogenesis of not only cancers but 
also neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious 
diseases. With the progress of metabonomics and proteomics, metabolites have 
been found to affect protein acylations through providing acyl groups or 
changing the activities of acyltransferases or deacylases. Reciprocally, protein 
acylation is involved in key cellular processes relevant to physiology and 
diseases, such as protein stability, protein subcellular localization, enzyme 
activity, transcriptional activity, protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA 
interactions. Herein, we summarize the functional diversity and mechanisms of 
eight kinds of nonhistone protein acylations in the physiological processes and 
progression of several diseases. We also highlight the recent progress in the 
development of inhibitors for acyltransferase, deacylase, and acylation reader 
proteins for their potential applications in drug discovery."
139,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most prominent causes of cancer-associated 
mortality in the world, with chemoresistance representing one of the leading 
causes of treatment failure. However, the mechanisms governing such 
chemoresistance remain incompletely understood. In this study, the role of DYRK2 
as a mediator of CRC cell drug resistance and the associated molecular 
mechanisms were assessed by evaluating human tumor tissue samples, CRC cell 
lines, and animal model systems. Initial analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas 
database and clinical tissue microarrays revealed significant DYRK2 
downregulation in CRC in a manner correlated with poor prognosis. We further 
generated LoVo CRC cells that were resistant to the chemotherapeutic drug 5-FU, 
and found that such chemoresistance was associated with the downregulation of 
DYRK2 and a more aggressive mesenchymal phenotype. When DYRK2 was overexpressed 
in these cells, their proliferative, migratory, and invasive activities were 
reduced and they were more prone to apoptotic death. DYRK2 overexpression was 
also associated with enhanced chemosensitivity and the inhibition of 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction in these LoVo 5-FUR cells. 
Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that DYRK2 bound to Twist and promoted 
its proteasomal degradation. In vivo studies further confirmed that the 
overexpression of DYRK2 inhibited human CRC xenograft tumor growth with 
concomitant Twist downregulation. Overall, these results thus highlight DYRK2 as 
a promising therapeutic target in CRC worthy of further investigation."
140,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most prevelant malignancy in Europe and 
diet is an important modifiable risk factor. Processed meat consumption, 
including meats with preservative salts such as sodium nitrite, have been 
implicated in CRC pathogenesis. This study investigated how the CRC pathology 
and metabolic status of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) multiple intestinal 
neoplasia (min) mice was perturbed following 8 weeks of pork meat consumption. 
Dietary inclusions (15%) of either nitrite-free pork, nitrite-free sausage, or 
nitrite-containing sausage (frankfurter) were compared against a parallel 
control group (100% chow). Comprehensive studies investigated: gastrointestinal 
tract histology (tumours), aberrant crypt foci (ACF), mucin deplin foci (MDF), 
lipid peroxidation (urine and serum), faecal microbiota, and serum metabolomics 
(599 metabolites). After 8 weeks mice consuming the frankfurter diet had 53% 
more (P = 0.014) gastrointestinal tumours than control, although ACF and MDF did 
not differ. Urine and serum lipid peroxidation markers were 59% (P = 0.001) and 
108% (P = 0.001) higher, respectively in the frankfurter group. Gut dysbiosis 
was evident in these mice with comparably fewer Bacteriodes and more Firmicutes. 
Fasting serum levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and numerous triglycerides 
were elevated. Various serum phosphotidylcholine species were decreased. These 
results demonstrate that nitrite-containing sausages may exaccerbate the 
development of CRC pathology in APCMin mice to a greater extent than 
nitrite-free sausages, and this is associated with greater lipid peroxidation, 
wide-ranging metabolic alternation and gut dysbiosis."
141,"BACKGROUND: The American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines recommend Dynamic 
Risk Stratification (DRS) for predicting long-term outcomes and personalizing 
management in adult differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs). However, its 
applicability in pediatric DTCs needs to be validated. Here, we attempted a 
validation study concerning the use of DRS in pediatric DTCs.
METHODS: Data of children (age ≤18 years) with DTCs and follow-up of ≥5 years 
were extracted. All patients were classified according to DRS (excellent, 
biochemical-, or structural-incomplete responses). Univariate and multivariate 
analyses were done to identify factor(s) affecting disease-free survival (DFS).
RESULTS: We included 176 pediatric DTC patients (median age at diagnosis: 15 
years). All patients underwent thyroidectomy and received radioiodine as part of 
initial management. On the basis of clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings 
acquired during the first two years of follow-up, the DRS system divided 
patients into three response categories: excellent response in 82/176 (46.6%), 
biochemical-incomplete in 56/176 (31.8%), and structural-incomplete response in 
38/176 (21.6%) patients. The median follow-up was 10.6 years (interquartile 
range: 7.7-15.5). Ten-year overall survival and DFS rates were 100% and 88.7%, 
respectively. In univariate analysis, DFS was significantly affected by 
extra-thyroidal extension (p = 0.002), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.018), ATA 
initial risk stratification (p = 0.033), and DRS (p = 0.004). However, in 
multivariate analysis, DRS alone showed a significant association with DFS 
(p = 0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: Like adults, DRS correctly predicts long-term outcomes in pediatric 
DTC. In addition to ATA initial risk stratification, DRS could further refine 
risk in pediatric DTCs and help in planning more personalised treatment and 
follow-up strategies."
142,"Since Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) was linked as the predominant etiology of 
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in 2008, three additional human polyomaviruses 
(HPyV) have been definitively linked to cutaneous diseases-trichodysplasia 
spinulosa virus (TSPyV) and human polyomavirus 6 and 7 (HPyV6, HPyV7). TSPyV 
contributes to the development of trichodysplasia spinulosa (TS), and HPyV6/7 is 
associated closely with the eruption of pruritic and dyskeratotic dermatoses 
(PDD). Clinically, MCC is treated with surgical excision and radiation with 
adjuvant chemotherapy, although newer treatment options include immune 
checkpoint inhibition. These novel immunotherapies hold promise for the 
treatment of metastatic MCC, but resistance and side effects prevent a 
significant proportion of patients from realizing their benefits. Based on 
previous case reports, the standard of care for the less deadly but disfiguring 
cutaneous disease TS include immunosuppressant (IS) reduction, the use of 
antivirals such as cidofovir (CDV) or valganciclovir (VGCV), or a combination of 
these treatments. Similar treatments were attempted for PDD, but oral acitretin 
was found to be most effective. As MCC, TS, and PDD are rare diseases, further 
research is required for effective treatments. In this review, we summarize 
clinical trials, preclinical studies, and case reports that present outcomes and 
side effects of current and emerging treatments for HPyV-associated cutaneous 
diseases, offering a comprehensive resource for clinical application and 
prospective clinical trials."
143,"AIMS: To explore the lived experiences of emergency department (ED) healthcare 
professionals regarding visiting restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
DESIGN: A qualitative phenomenology study.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken. Participants consisted of 
10 physicians, 20 clinical nurses, and three managers, who were purposefully 
selected from two EDs in China between April and July 2021. Colaizzi's approach 
guided data analysis.
RESULTS: Four themes arose: (i) burden moral injury, (ii) higher workload to 
provide and support patient- and family-centered care, (iii) dissatisfied and 
unsafe healthcare service for patients and families, and (iv) tailoring 
strategies to provide family-centered care.
PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study explored the lived experiences of ED 
health care professionals regarding visiting restrictions during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Noted challenges included communicating with families and ethical 
decision making. Strategies that support ED clinician welfare, and communication 
with families are warranted if visiting policy restrictions are continued or 
re-introduced."
144,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Different approaches are available after progression of 
disease (PD) to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) for hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), including continuation of ICI, treatment switching to tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (TKIs) and cessation of anticancer therapy. We sought to characterise 
the relationship between radiologic patterns of progression and survival 
post-ICI, also appraising treatment strategies.
METHODS: We screened 604 HCC patients treated with ICIs, including only those 
who experienced PD by data cut-off. We evaluated post-progression survival (PPS) 
according to treatment strategy at PD and verified its relationship with 
radiologic patterns of progression: intrahepatic growth (IHG), new intrahepatic 
lesion (NIH), extrahepatic growth (EHG), new extrahepatic lesion (NEH) and new 
vascular invasion (nVI).
RESULTS: Of 604 patients, 364 (60.3%) experienced PD during observation. Median 
PPS was 5.3 months (95%CI: 4.4-6.9; 271 events). At data cut-off, 165 patients 
(45%) received no post-progression anticancer therapy; 64 patients (17.6%) 
continued ICI beyond PD. IHG (HR 1.64 [95%CI:1.21-2.22]; p=0.0013) and nVI (HR 
2.15 [95%CI:1.38-3.35]; p=0.0007) were associated with shorter PPS. Multivariate 
models adjusted for progression patterns, treatment line, and ALBI grade and 
ECOG-PS at PD confirmed receipt of ICI beyond PD with (HR 0.17, 95%CI 0.09-0.32; 
p<0.0001), or without subsequent TKI (HR 0.39, 95%CI 0.26-0.58; p<0.0001) as 
predictors of prolonged PPS versus no anticancer therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: ICI-TKI sequencing is a consolidated option in advanced HCC. nVI 
and IHG predict poorer prognosis. Despite lack of recommendation, continuation 
of ICI beyond progression in HCC is adopted clinically: future efforts should 
appraise which patients benefit from this approach."
145,"Introduction&#160;: The idea of therapeutic fasting with healing virtues is 
circulating among cancer patients. Our study aims to improve knowledge of this 
practice, which is contraindicated in France during chemotherapy, and to 
establish recommendations to facilitate exchanges between doctors and 
patients.Methods&#160;: Chemotherapy patients completed a self-questionnaire on 
diet, therapeutic fasting and alternative medicine. A subsample of patients 
intending to follow dietary restrictions were interviewed.Results&#160;: Among 
the 133 participants, more than half had changed their diet and/or had heard of 
therapeutic fasting. Twenty-one patients intended to fast or have dietary 
restrictions during chemotherapy. These were mainly women, with an average age 
of 56 years, being treated for breast cancer, using alternative medications. 
They had little interaction with the health care team but would have liked to 
have had some with their oncologist. Nine patients were interviewed. They had 
tested short fasting and/or a ketogenic diet to improve treatment efficacy, 
reduce side effects and/or gain more control over their management. They did not 
dare to talk about it with the oncologist but regretted their silence. They are 
often advised by naturopaths and have tested homeopathy to accompany their 
treatment.Conclusions&#160;: Patients explain that they want to put all the odds 
in their favor. They would like the medical profession to offer times for 
discussion on fasting, silence being perceived as potentially harmful."

clinical challenges in a highly vulnerable patient category. These were 
associated with many uncertainties for patients and health care professionals 
and prompted many ethical debates regarding the safe delivery of kidney 
transplantation. In this article, we highlight some of the most important 
ethical questions that were raised during the pandemic and attempt to analyze 
ethical arguments in light of core principles of medical ethics to either 
suspend or continue kidney transplantation, and to mandate vaccination in 
transplant patients, transplant candidates, and, finally, health care providers. 
We have come up with frameworks to deal responsibly with these ethical 
challenges, and formulated recommendations to cope with the issues imposed on 
patients and transplant professionals."
147,"CONTEXT: In health care, monitoring of quality indicators (QIs) in general 
urology remains underdeveloped in comparison to other clinical specialties.
OBJECTIVE: To identify, synthesise, and appraise QIs that monitor in-hospital 
care for urology patients.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This systematic review included peer-reviewed articles 
identified via Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, CINAHL, Global Health, Google 
Scholar, and grey literature from 2000 to February 19, 2021. The review was 
carried out under the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and used the Appraisal of Indicators through 
Research and Evaluation (AIRE) tool for quality assessment.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 5111 articles and 62 government agencies were 
screened for QI sets. There were a total of 57 QI sets included for analysis. 
Most QIs focused on uro-oncology, with prostate, bladder, and testicular cancers 
the most represented. The most common QIs were surgical QIs in uro-oncology 
(positive surgical margin, surgical volume), whereas in non-oncology the QIs 
most frequently reported were for treatment and diagnosis. Out of 61 articles, 
only four scored a total of ≥50% on the AIRE tool across four domains. Aside 
from QIs developed in uro-oncology, general urological QIs are underdeveloped 
and of poor methodological quality and most lack testing for both content 
validity and reliability.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need for the development of methodologically 
robust QIs in the clinical specialty of general urology for patients to enable 
standardised quality of care monitoring and to improve patient outcomes.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We investigated a range of quality indicators (QIs) that 
provide health care professionals with feedback on the quality of their care for 
patients with general urological diseases. We found that aside from urological 
cancers, there is a lack of QIs for general urology. Hence, there is an urgent 
need for the development of robust and disease-specific QIs in general urology."
148,"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a complex treatment used in 
malignancies and some non-malignant diseases. The informed consent process for 
HCT can also be complex due to patient- and process-related barriers. The 
informed consent process needs to be a dynamic and ongoing process, not simply a 
checklist. As a result of the realities of HCT, we highlight some potential 
pitfalls to the informed consent process including uncertainty, sociocultural 
and communication barriers, and decisional regret. The purpose of this 
comprehensive review is to highlight unique situations which can result in 
failure of the informed consent process. We also offer potential solutions to 
these pitfalls, primarily making the informed consent more patient focused 
through dynamic and continuous processes to mitigate decisional regret."
149,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of morbidity and mortality after hepatic resection often 
lacks stratification by extent of resection or diagnosis. Although a liver 
resection for different indications may have technical similarities, 
postoperative outcomes differ. The aim of this systematic review and 
meta-analysis was to determine the risk of major complications and mortality 
after resection of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
METHODS: Meta-analysis was performed to assess postoperative mortality 
(in-hospital, 30-, and 90-day) and major complications (Clavien-Dindo grade 
≥III).
RESULTS: A total of 32 studies that reported on 19,503 patients were included. 
Pooled in-hospital, 30-day, and 90-day mortality were 5.9% (95% confidence 
interval 4.1-8.4); 4.6% (95% confidence interval 4.0-5.2); and 6.1% (95% 
confidence interval 5.0-7.3), respectively. Pooled proportion of major 
complications was 22.2% (95% confidence interval 17.7-27.5) for all resections. 
The pooled 90-day mortality was 3.1% (95% confidence interval 1.8-5.2) for a 
minor resection, 7.4% (95% confidence interval 5.9-9.3) for all major 
resections, and 11.4% (95% confidence interval 6.9-18.7) for extended resections 
(P = .001). Major complications were 38.8% (95% confidence interval 29.5-49) 
after a major hepatectomy compared to 11.3% (95% confidence interval 5.0-24.0) 
after a minor hepatectomy (P = .001). Asian studies had a pooled 90-day 
mortality of 4.4% (95% confidence interval 3.3-5.9) compared to 6.8% (95% 
confidence interval 5.6-8.2) for Western studies (P = .02). Cohorts with 
patients included before 2000 had a pooled 90-day mortality of 5.9% (95% 
confidence interval 4.8-7.3) compared to 6.8% (95% confidence interval 5.1-9.1) 
after 2000 (P = .44).
CONCLUSION: When informing patients or comparing outcomes across hospitals, 
postoperative mortality rates after liver resection should be reported for 
90-days with consideration of the diagnosis and the extent of liver resection."
150,"PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the preoperative systemic 
inflammation response index (SIRI) to predict the outcomes after open radical 
cystectomy (RC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the 
institutional cystectomy database and identified 241 consecutive RC patients. 
Patient demographics and oncologic outcomes were noted. We calculated the SIRI 
as previously described (NeutrophilxMonocytes/Lymphocytes), based on the 
blood-tests at the day before surgery and a minimum >30-day later.
RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 20 months (interquartile range 9-52). Two, 3 
and 5 years recurrence free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 60.6%, 
57.1%, 48.9%, and 54.7%, 47.0%, 37.2%, respectively. Patients with preoperative 
SIRI >1.91 had significantly higher recurrence rates (P < 0.001) and lower OS (P 
< 0.001). For internal validation, we evaluated postoperative SIRI >1.91 
(repeatability testing), and again found significantly higher recurrence rates 
(P < 0.001) and lower OS (P = 0.004). Persistently high SIRI increased the 
recurrence and death risk 5.79 and 2.87 fold, respectively. SIRI was also a 
significant independent predictive factor for RFS and OS in the multivariable 
cox regression analyses (P < 0.05). SIRI improved the discriminative ability of 
the models 1.5% to 4.2% and this was quite higher than other inflammatory 
markers (NLR, MLR, PLR, SII) in all models.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SIRI >1.91 had significantly higher recurrence and 
lower OS rates. The cut-off value is validated internally. SIRI is an 
independent predictive factor for RFS and OS. The contribution of SIRI in the 
cox models is higher than other inflammatory markers."
151,"AIM: To explore the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics 
and whole-lesion apparent diffusion coefficient histogram analysis of brain 
metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the differentiation of 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with brain metastases from NSCLC 
were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were subtyped into EGFR 
mutation (23 cases) and wild-type (25 cases) groups. Whole-lesion histogram 
metrics were derived from the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and 
imaging features were evaluated according to conventional MRI. Student's t-test 
or Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-squared test, and receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve analysis were performed to discriminate the two groups and to 
determine the diagnostic efficacy of ADC histogram parameters.
RESULTS: EGFR mutation group had more multiple brain metastases, less 
peritumoural brain oedema (PTBO), and lower peritumoural brain oedema index 
(PTBO-I) than EGFR wild-type group (all p<0.05). In addition, 90th and 75th 
percentiles of ADC and maximum ADC in the EGFR mutation group were significantly 
higher than in the EGFR wild-type group (all p<0.05). Ninetieth percentile of 
ADC had the highest area under the curve (AUC; 0.711), and it was found to 
outperform 75th percentile of ADC (AUC, 0.662; p=0.039) and maximum ADC (AUC, 
0.681).
CONCLUSIONS: Whole-lesion ADC histogram analysis and MRI features of brain 
metastasis from NSCLC are expected to be potential biomarkers to non-invasively 
differentiate the EGFR mutation status."
152,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive disease, with a growing incidence, and a 
poor prognosis. Neoadjuvant treatments in PC are highly recommended in 
borderline resectable and recently in upfront resectable PC. PC is characterized 
by exocrine insufficiency and nutritional imbalance, leading to 
malnutrition/sarcopenia. The concept of malnutrition in PC is multifaceted, as 
the cancer-related alterations create an interplay with adverse effects of 
anticancer treatments. All these critical factors have a negative impact on the 
postoperative and oncological outcomes. A series of actions and programs can be 
implemented to improve resectable and borderline resectable PC in terms of 
postoperative complications, oncological outcomes and patients' quality of life. 
A timely nutritional evaluation and the implementation of appropriate 
evidence-based nutritional interventions in onco-surgical patients should be 
considered of importance to improve preoperative physical fitness. 
Unfortunately, nutritional care and its optimization are often neglected in 
real-world clinical practice. Currently available studies and ERAS® guidelines 
mostly support the use of pre- or perioperative medical nutrition, including 
immunonutrition, in order to decrease the rate of postoperative infections and 
length of hospital stay. Further data also suggest that medical nutrition should 
be considered proactively in PC patients, to possibly prevent severe 
malnutrition and its consequences on disease and treatment outcomes. This 
narrative review summarizes the most recent data related to the role of 
prehabilitation, ERAS® program, medical nutrition, and the timing of 
intervention on clinical outcomes of upfront resectable and borderline PC, and 
their potential implementation within the timeframe of neoadjuvant treatments."
153,"OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is the most lethal malignancy for women worldwide. 
Developed countries, such as Portugal, Spain, and the United States, have 
declining mortality rates due to breast cancer; however, in developing 
countries, the epidemiological reports are scarce. In this context, the aims of 
this study are to describe and discuss the female breast cancer profile of 
hospitalization and mortality according to age and geographic region in Brazil 
from 2008 to 2019.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Health System Department of 
Informatics (DATASUS), maintained by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which 
includes the registers of hospitalization and mortality by malignant neoplasm of 
breast (code C50, ICD-10). Proportional rates of hospitalization and deaths were 
estimated per 100,000 inhabitants according to respective subjects' age, region, 
and year of the occurrence.
RESULTS: From 2008 to 2019, 643,822 hospital admissions due to malignant 
neoplasm of breast were reported in Brazil, of which the South and Southeast 
regions were the most prevalent. Higher hospitalization rates were seen in 
subjects aged 50-79-years-old. Regarding mortality, 53,480 deaths by breast 
cancer were reported; similarly to hospitalization, the Southeast and South were 
the most affected regions. Mortality rates have increased over time in different 
magnitudes depending on subjects' age.
CONCLUSION: We have shown an increase in morbidity and mortality over time, 
which is dependent on patients' age and region. The results presented here may 
contribute to the ongoing discussion about the role and future perspectives of 
the Brazilian health care system, especially regarding to the strategies for the 
prevention, control, and treatment of breast cancer."
154,"AIM: Organ saving treatment for early-stage rectal cancer can reduce patient 
reported side effects compared to standard total mesorectal excision (TME) and 
preserve quality of life (QOL). An optimal strategy for achieving organ 
preservation and longer-term oncological outcomes are unknown, thus there is a 
need for high quality trials.
METHOD: Can we Save the rectum by watchful waiting or TransAnal surgery 
following (chemo)Radiotherapy versus Total mesorectal excision for early REctal 
Cancer (STAR-TREC) is an international 3-arm multi-centre, partially randomised 
controlled trial incorporating an external pilot. In phase III, patients with 
cT1-3b N0 tumours, ≤40mm in diameter, who prefer organ preservation are 
randomised 1:1 between mesorectal long course chemoradiation versus mesorectal 
short course radiotherapy, with selective transanal microsurgery. Patients 
preferring radical surgery receive TME. STAR-TREC aims to recruit 380 patients 
to organ preservation and 120 to TME surgery. The primary outcome is the rate of 
organ preservation at 30 months. Secondary clinician reported outcomes include 
acute treatment-related toxicity, rate of non-operative management, non-regrowth 
pelvic tumour control at 36 months, non-regrowth disease free survival at 36 
months, and overall survival at 60 months and patient reported toxicity, health 
related QOL at baseline, 12 and 24 months. Exploratory biomarker research uses 
circulating tumour DNA to predict response and relapse.
DISCUSSION: STAR-TREC will prospectively evaluate contrasting therapeutic 
strategies and implement new measures including a smaller mesorectal target 
volume, 2-step response assessment and non-operative management for complete 
response. The trial will yield important information to guide routine management 
of patients with early-stage rectal cancer."
155,"Cost and availability have often dictated the use of heterologous/alien 
prolactins in experiments, particularly in vivo. The assumption has been that 
what is initiated in the target cell is representative of the homologous hormone 
since many heterologous mammalian prolactins bind to and activate rodent 
receptors. Here, we examined gene expression in mouse liver in response to a 
7-day treatment with recombinant mouse prolactin (mRecPRL), recombinant ovine 
prolactin (oRecPRL) and pituitary extract ovine prolactin (oPitPRL). Having 
established mouse ribosomal protein S9 as the most stable reference gene in the 
liver in the absence and presence of prolactin treatment, we examined expression 
of the two most highly expressed prolactin receptors (PRLRs) and three members 
of the Cyp3a group of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes by qRTPCR. For short form (SF) 
3 PRLR, mRecPRL doubled expression while for oRecPRL and oPitPRL expression was 
only 1.3-fold control. For the long form (LF) PRLR, changes were similar to 
those seen for SF 3 PRLR, such that the SF3:LF PRLR ratio remained the same. 
Expression of the Cyp3as was also dependent on the prolactin origin and, 
although mRecPRL always stimulated, the other PRLs caused varying results. 
Compared to control, Cyp3a16 was stimulated 12-fold by mRecPRL, 3-fold by 
oRecPRL, and 6-fold by oPitPRL. For Cyp3a41, mRecPRL was 3.7-fold control, 
oRecPRL was without effect, and oPitPRL was 2-fold control. Importantly, for 
Cyp3a44, mRecPRL stimulated 2-fold, whereas both oRecPRL and oPitPRL had an 
opposite, inhibitory effect, with expression at 0.5-fold control. We conclude 
that homologous hormone had the largest stimulatory effect on expression of all 
measured genes and that by contrast heterologous hormone showed reduced 
activity, no activity, or opposite activity, depending on the gene being 
analyzed. Thus, experimentation using alien heterologous PRL may lead to 
inaccurate conclusions."

157,"EUS-guided treatments for focal tumor lesions has been developed since 20 years 
using at onset of the technique mainly local and guided alcohol injection [1-4]. 
Pancreatic tumors are the most assessed targeted lesions for EUS treatment 
because of their accessibility and because EUS management could be a safe 
alternative to surgery. More and more pancreatic tumors are discovered mainly 
fortuitously due to the advances in conventional imaging (abdominal ultrasound, 
CT, MRI) resulting in the question of surgical management of an asymptomatic 
pancreatic lesion (""incidentaloma"") [5-8]. The lesions detected include mostly 
pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCN) and neuroendocrine tumors (NET) mainly well 
differentiated. Clinically, NET are mostly non-functional and do not induce 
secretory disorders [5-8]. Once their nature is yielded by diagnostic tests like 
EUS-FNA, incidental nonfunctional NET currently lead to difficult management 
when their largest diameter is less than 2 cm [2,4,9,10]. EUS-guided treatment 
for pancreatic adenocarcinoma have also been developed with recent prospective 
observational study and randomized control study [11,12]. Thus, therapeutic 
surgical choices could be challenged by EUS- guided treatment [2,4,9]."
158,"Myoepithelial carcinomas (MECs) of soft tissue are rare and aggressive tumors 
affecting young adults and children, but their molecular landscape has not been 
comprehensively explored through genome sequencing. Here, we present the 
whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and RNA sequencing 
findings of two MECs. Patients 1 and 2 (P1, P2), both male, were diagnosed at 27 
and 37 yr of age, respectively, with shoulder (P1) and inguinal (P2) soft tissue 
tumors. Both patients developed metastatic disease, and P2 died of disease. P1 
tumor showed a rhabdoid cytomorphology and a complete loss of INI1 (SMARCB1) 
expression, associated with a homozygous SMARCB1 deletion. The tumor from P2 
showed a clear cell/small cell morphology, retained INI1 expression and strong 
S100 positivity. By WES and WGS, tumors from both patients displayed low tumor 
mutation burdens, and no targetable alterations in cancer genes were detected. 
P2's tumor harbored an EWSR1::KLF15 rearrangement, whereas the tumor from P1 
showed a novel ASCC2::GGNBP2 fusion. WGS evidenced a complex genomic event 
involving mainly Chromosomes 17 and 22 in the tumor from P1, which was 
consistent with chromoplexy. These findings are consistent with previous reports 
of EWSR1 rearrangements (50% of cases) in MECs and provide a genetic basis for 
the loss of SMARCB1 protein expression observed through immunohistochemistry in 
10% of 40% of MEC cases. The lack of additional driver mutations in these tumors 
supports the hypothesis that these alterations are the key molecular events in 
MEC evolution. Furthermore, the presence of complex structural variant patterns, 
invisible to WES, highlights the novel biological insights that can be gained 
through the application of WGS to rare cancers."
159,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been approved in 
malignancies associated with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants, such 
as breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. In malignancies not 
associated with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants, the therapeutic 
relevance of PARP inhibitors is less clear. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
is known to demonstrate somatic alterations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. The current 
report is on a gentleman with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with a somatic 
BRCA2 pathogenic variant, who was effectively treated with olaparib. 
Furthermore, we discuss the existing data for use of PARP inhibitors in NSCLC. 
This study highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing in identifying 
gene mutations and demonstrates how such information can be used to select 
targeted therapies in patients with actionable molecular alterations."
160,"OBJECTIVES: Antioxidant property like radical scavenging is a primary target to 
elucidate the efficacy mechanism of a drug against diseases linked to oxidative 
stress such as cancer, metabolic disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. In 
alternative therapies, homeopathy is one of the preferred choices by patients 
and clinicians due to its potential to cure chronic and complex illnesses. 
However, the efficacy of homeopathic preparations at high diluted potencies 
attracts rational criticism due to insufficient scientific knowledge supporting 
the mechanism of action. Therefore, an attempt was made to estimate the total 
phenolic content (TPC) and radical scavenging activity of clinically prescribed 
homeopathic drugs.
METHODS: With gallic acid as a reference control, mother tinctures (MTs) and 
different potencies of Eucalyptus globulus (EG), Syzygium jambolanum (SJ), Ruta 
graveolens (RG), and Thuja occidentalis (TO) were used to perform 
Folin-Ciocalteu test, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) 
(ABTS), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays.
RESULTS: The results showed TPC of MTs equivalent to µg/mL of gallic acid viz; 
EG (4,872.5 ± 133.2), SJ (8,840.5 ± 14.8), RG (985.6 ± 39.1), and TO 
(341.5 ± 19.5) with significant ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging potential. 
Whereas 30C and 200C potencies of each homeopathic drug showed undetectable 
phenolic content and insignificant radical scavenging potential compared to 
vehicle control, i.e., alcohol 90% (2.0 ± 1.5).
CONCLUSIONS: The reported efficacy of 30C and 200C potencies of homeopathic 
medicines against oxidative stress-related illnesses might be due to mechanisms 
other than radical scavenging. Furthermore, the assays studied can be helpful in 
drug standardization and quality control of MTs that are used as starting 
material in homeopathic preparations."
161,"BACKGROUND: Compared with inhalation anesthesia, propofol-based total 
intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) improves long-term outcomes after cancer surgery. 
However, its effect on patients undergoing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
surgery remains unclear. We aimed to compare the oncological outcomes of TIVA 
and inhalation anesthesia after curative resection of early-stage NSCLC.
METHODS: We analyzed the medical records of patients diagnosed with stage I or 
II NSCLC who underwent curative resection at a tertiary university hospital 
between January 2010 and December 2017. The primary outcomes were 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) according to anesthesia 
type.
RESULTS: We included 1,508 patients with stage I/II NSCLC. The patients were 
divided into the TIVA (n = 980) and inhalation (n = 528) groups. The two groups 
were well balanced in terms of baseline clinical characteristics. The TIVA group 
showed a better RFS (7.7 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.37-8.02) than 
the inhalation group (6.8 years; 95% CI, 6.30-7.22, P = 0.003). Similarly, TIVA 
was superior to inhalation agents with respect to OS (median OS, 8.4 years [95% 
CI, 8.08-8.69] vs. 7.3 years [95% CI, 6.81-7.71]; P < 0.0001). Multivariable Cox 
regression analysis revealed that TIVA was an independent prognostic factor 
related to recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 95% CI] 1.04-1.47, P = 0.014) and 
OS (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.12-1.72, P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Propofol-based TIVA was associated with better RFS and OS than 
inhalation anesthesia in patients with stage I/II NSCLC who underwent curative 
resection."
162,"PURPOSE: There is no consensus on the ideal treatment of odontogenic keratocysts 
(OKCs). Certain risk factors may modify the disease recurrence rate. The purpose 
of this study was: 1) to estimate the incidence of OKC recurrence in a 
statistically rigorous manner; and 2) to identify risk factors associated with 
OKC recurrence.
METHODS: The investigators designed and implemented a retrospective cohort study 
and enrolled a sample derived from the population of patients presenting to the 
Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery outpatient clinics at the 
University of Washington School of Dentistry and Harborview Medical Center for 
evaluation and management of OKCs between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 
2020. Predictor variables included demographics (age, gender), radiographic 
characteristics (location of lesion, locularity, size, and cortical 
perforation), and type of operation performed (decompression + cystectomy, 
enucleation ± adjuvant therapy, or resection). The primary outcome variable was 
time to recurrent disease, defined as the time from treatment to radiographic or 
clinical evidence of a new lesion (recorded in months). Kaplan-Meier analysis 
was used to estimate median time to recurrence, and Cox proportional hazards 
models were used to identify covariates statistically associated with recurrent 
disease (P ≤ .05).
RESULTS: The sample was composed of 60 subjects with 63 previously untreated 
lesions. Eight subjects (13%) developed a recurrent lesion during the study 
interval with a median time to recurrence of 31 (interquartile range, 24 to 48) 
months. One of the 8 recurrences occurred within 12 months of treatment and 7 of 
the 8 recurrences occurred more than 21 months after treatment. Based on using 
Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 5-year incidence of disease recurrence was estimated 
to be 34%. Lesions with cortical perforation were 8.3 times more likely to recur 
(95% confidence interval [1.7, 41.3]; P-value = .01), and multilocular lesions 
were 10.6 times more likely to recur (95% confidence interval [1.3, 86.9]; 
P-value = .03). The sample size was the limiting factor to performing regression 
analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Virtually every publication on OKCs to date reports frequencies of 
disease recurrence rather than applying appropriate survival analyses commonly 
used to estimate outcomes in cancer research. Failure to use the appropriate 
statistical analyses underestimates the risk of disease recurrence. Our study is 
no exception. The estimated frequency of disease recurrence during the study 
interval was 13% (8/60). When survival analyses are applied that account for 
varying months of follow-up, the incidence of disease recurrence is 34 per 100 
per 5 years. We recommend the application of time-to-event analyses in the study 
of disease entities with the potential for recurrence."
163,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major public health burden in Hong Kong, and 
chronic hepatitis B is the most common HCC etiology in our region. With the high 
case load, extensive local expertise on HCC has been accumulated. This article 
summarized local guidelines and real-life practice on HCC management in Hong 
Kong. For HCC surveillance, liver ultrasound and serum alpha-fetoprotein for 
periodic screening is recommended in viral hepatitis or cirrhotic patients, and 
this is adhered to in clinical practice. HCC diagnosis is not covered in local 
guidelines, yet our practice is in-line with regional guidelines, where 
diagnosis is usually achieved by cross-sectional imaging and without the need 
for histology. Our guidelines recommend using the Hong Kong Liver Cancer (HKLC) 
Staging for pre-treatment staging, yet we routinely use other widely-adopted 
systems such as the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) Staging and the 
Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) Staging as well. Our local guidelines have provided 
clear treatment algorithms for the whole range of HCC therapies, including 
resection, ablation, transplant, transarterial chemoembolization, transarterial 
radioembolization, stereotactic body radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and 
immunotherapy. Real-life treatment choices are largely in line with the 
guidelines, although treatment protocols are individualized, and availability of 
specific therapies can vary between centers. Overall, HCC guidelines in Hong 
Kong are tailored based on local expertise and our unique patient population. 
The guidelines are up-to-date and provide practical pathways to assist our 
routine practice. Regular updates of local guidelines are warranted to account 
for the rapidly evolving paradigm of HCC management."
164,"Sialic acids are key mediators of cell function, particularly with regard to 
cellular interactions with the surrounding environment. Reagents that modulate 
the display of specific sialyl glycoforms at the cell surface would be useful

the control of cell surface sialosides, none that shows high selectivity between 
sialyltransferases or that targets a specific sialyl glycoform has yet to 
emerge. Here, we describe a strategy to block the formation of α2,8-linked 
sialic acid chains (oligo- and polysialic acid) through the use of 8-keto-sialic

165,"INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer. As metastasis and 
recurrence are main causes of CRC death, it is of great significance to find 
prognostic biomarkers.
METHODS: Data related to CRC were collected from GEO database. The patients were 
grouped based on clinical information, and the differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) were obtained by differential analysis. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment 
analyses were conducted based on DEGs. Cox combined with LASSO regression 
analysis was applied to screen out the key genes that used to build the 
prognostic model. Survival curve and receiver operating characteristic curve 
were employed to evaluate the validity and reliability of the model. Cox 
regression analysis was applied to determine the independence of risk score. 
GSEA and GSVA analyses were performed on patients with different risks according 
to the risk model scores, and the prognostic nomogram was plotted combined with 
clinical data. Also, qRT-PCR was applied to examine the expression status of the 
screened signatures in clinical cases.
RESULTS: We obtained 302 DEGs by dividing CRC patients into early-stage and 
advanced-stage groups. The results of enrichment analyses demonstrated that the 
DEGs were mainly concentrated in tissues of extracellular matrix, epithelial 
cell proliferation, and cell adhesion-related pathways. Regression identified 9 
hub genes notably correlated with prognosis, including CLK1, SLC2A3, LIPG, 
EPHB2, ATOH1, PLCB4, GZMB, CKMT2, and CXCL11. The validation of the risk model 
proved that the risk model was accurate and could independently determine the 
prognosis of patients. Finally, differences were found in pathway activity of 
extracellular matrix secretion, plaque secretion, Notch signaling pathway, and 
tight junctions in high-risk and low-risk patients. In addition to LIPG and 
CKMT2, other feature genes were notably overexpressed in CRC tumor tissues.
CONCLUSION: The results proved that the expression levels of the 9 biomarkers 
could be used to predict the prognosis of CRC patients."
166,"INTRODUCTION: Conflicting reports exist about the effect obesity has on adverse 
postoperative surgical outcomes after distal pancreatectomy (DP). The aim of 
this study is to explore the role of obesity in terms of morbidity and 
pancreas-specific complications following DP for pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
METHODS: All patients who underwent DP at a single institution over 10 y were 
analyzed (2009-2020). Patients were categorized as nonobese (body mass index 
[BMI] < 30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). Independent predictors of adverse 
postoperative outcomes were calculated using multivariate logistic regression 
models. Overall survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 178 patients included, 58 (32.5%) were obese. Clinically 
relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF) formation rate was 
significantly higher in the obese group (20.6% versus 7.5%, P value = 0.011). We 
did not identify any significant difference between obese and nonobese patients 
in median overall survival (30.2 mon versus 28.9 mon, P value = 0.811). On 
multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, BMI ≥ 30 was an independent 
predictor of morbidity (any complication) and CR-POPF formation after DP for 
PDAC.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is associated with a significantly increased risk for 
CR-POPF in patients undergoing DP for PDAC. Obesity should be considered as a 
variable in fistula risk calculators for DP."
167,"OBJECTIVE: Histopathology image segmentation can assist medical professionals in 
identifying and diagnosing diseased tissue more efficiently. Although fully 
supervised segmentation models have excellent performance, the annotation cost 
is extremely expensive. Weakly supervised models are widely used in medical 
image segmentation due to their low annotation cost. Nevertheless, these weakly 
supervised models have difficulty in accurately locating the boundaries between 
different classes of regions in pathological images, resulting in a high rate of 
false alarms. Our objective is to design a weakly supervised segmentation model 
to resolve the above problems.
APPROACH: The segmentation model is divided into two main stages, the generation 
of pseudo labels based on Class Residual Attention Accumulation Network 
(CRAANet) and the semantic segmentation based on Pixel Feature Space 
Construction Network (PFSCNet). CRAANet provides attention scores for each class 
through the Class Residual Attention (CRA) module, while the Attention 
Accumulation (AA) module overlays the attention feature maps generated in each 
training epoch. PFSCNet employs a network model containing an inflated 
convolutional residual neural network and a multi-scale feature-aware module as 
the segmentation backbone, and proposes Dense Energy Loss (DE Loss) and Pixel 
Clustering (PCL) are modules based on contrast learning to solve the 
pseudo-labeling-inaccuracy problem.
MAIN RESULTS: We validate our method using the lung adenocarcinoma 
(LUAD-HistoSeg) dataset and the breast cancer (BCSS) dataset. The results of the 
experiments show that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art 
methods on both datasets in several metrics. This suggests that it is capable of 
performing well in a wide variety of histopathological image segmentation tasks.
SIGNIFICANCE: We propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation network that 
achieves approximate fully supervised segmentation performance even in the case 
of incomplete labels. The proposed attention accumulation and pixel-level 
contrast learning also make the edges more accurate and can well assist 
pathologists in their research."
168,"HOXA9 is commonly upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it confers 
poor prognosis. Characterising the protein interactome of endogenous HOXA9 in 
human AML, we identified a chromatin complex of HOXA9 with the nuclear matrix 
attachment protein-SAFB. SAFB perturbation phenocopied HOXA9 knockout to 
decrease AML proliferation, increase differentiation and apoptosis in vitro and 
prolonged survival in vivo. Integrated genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic 
analyses further demonstrated that the HOXA9-SAFB-chromatin complex associates 
with NuRD and HP1g to repress the expression of factors associated with 
differentiation and apoptosis, including NOTCH1, CEBPd, S100A8, and CDKN1A. 
Chemical or genetic perturbation of NuRD and HP1g -associated catalytic activity 
also triggered differentiation, apoptosis and the induction of these 
tumor-suppressive genes. Importantly, this mechanism is operative in other 
HOXA9-dependent AML genotypes. This mechanistic insight demonstrates active 
HOXA9-dependent differentiation block as a potent mechanism of disease 
maintenance in AML, that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention via 
therapies targeting the HOXA9/SAFB interface and/or NuRD and HP1g activity."
169,"Aim: To identify genes associated with the prognosis of head and neck squamous 
cell carcinoma (HNSC) and potential molecular targets for therapy. Materials and 
Methods: Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Human Protein Atlas, 
University of ALabama at Birmingham CANcer, LinkedOmics, cBioPortal, Cell 
Counting Kit 8, and polymerase chain reaction were used in this study. Results: 
The expression level of nuclear transport factor 2 (NUTF2) was elevated in HNSC 
tissues and was associated with poor prognosis in HNSC patients. NUTF2-targeted 
intervention inhibited the proliferation of HNSC cells. SEC61G, which was 
positively correlated with NUTF2, was decreased in HNSC cells with NUTF2 
suppression. Conclusions: NUTF2 may be correlated with the prognosis and 
development of HNSC, laying the foundation for future studies on the potential 
role of NUTF2 in HNSC."
170,"Aims: In this study, we determined whether different genotypes of 
drug-metabolizing enzymes are associated with the therapeutic effects of 
gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: A retrospective 
analysis of 112 patients with stage III or IV NSCLC was performed. The clinical 
characteristics of these patients, including progression-free survival (PFS), 
outcome of gefitinib treatment, and relationship between the genotypes of 
rs1065852/rs2242480 and prognosis, were analyzed. Results: The rs1065852 CT/TT 
genotype was associated with worse prognosis than the CC type (p = 0.0306), and 
the median PFS was lower than that with the CC type (287 days vs. 350 days). 
Compared with those with CC+CC genotypes, individuals carrying T alleles 
(CT/TT+CT/TT) at rs1065852/rs2242480 had a poorer prognosis, and the median PFS 
of CT/TT+CT/TT at rs1065852/rs2242480 was significantly lower than that of the 
CC+CC type (188 days vs. 444.5 days). Conclusions: Genotypes of the 
drug-metabolizing enzymes rs1065852 and rs2242480 have an impact on the 
prognosis of patients with NSCLC treated with gefitinib."
171,"Background: Liver cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignant 
tumors, with an extremely high incidence rate. Diagnosis of liver cancer is 
difficult with the existing methods and improved biomarkers are urgently needed. 
A number of studies have established a link between abnormal miR-375 expression 
and liver cancer. Therefore, we conducted a systematic analysis to appraise 
whether miR-375 can be used as a screening tool for liver cancer detection. 
Methods: Through a systematic database search, studies investigating miR-375 
expression in serum by the quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR 
(qRT-PCR) method were included in the study. A total of 1,100 participants (576 
with liver cancer and 534 without liver cancer) were recruited. The efficacy of 
microRNA-375 in the detection of liver cancer was assessed by sensitivity, 
specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), 
diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under curve (AUC). Results: The pooled 
sensitivity and specificity of miR-375 in the detection of liver cancer were 
0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.98) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.67-0.92), 
respectively. Furthermore, the pooled PLR was 5.40 (95% CI: 2.58-11.31), NLR was 
0.10 (95% CI: 0.03-0.36), DOR was 52.52 (95% CI: 10.02-275.42), and AUC was 0.93 
(95% CI: 0.90-0.95), indicating that miR-375 is effective at detecting liver 
cancer. Conclusions: According to our meta-analysis, measuring serum miR-375 has 
high sensitivity and specificity, which will facilitate its clinical application 
in liver cancer monitoring."
172,"Chemical immunotherapeutic strategies including Antibody Recruiting Molecules 
(ARMs) direct immune-mediated clearance of diseased cells or pathogens. ARMs are 
bivalent small molecules containing an antibody-binding domain (ABD) and a 
target-binding domain (TBD) to recruit endogenous serum antibodies to highly 
overexpressed tumour antigens for immune mediated clearance. ARM function relies 
on a high tumour antigen valency, limiting function against lower antigen 
expressing tumours. To address this limitation, we report a tuneable multivalent 
immune recruitment platform (MIR) to amplify/stabilize antibody recruitment to 
cells with lower antigen valencies. An initial set of polymeric ARMs (pARMs) 
were synthesized and screened to evaluate ABD/TBD copy number, ratio, and steric 
occlusion on specific immune induction. Most pARMs demonstrate simultaneous high 
avidity binding to anti-dinitrophenyl antibodies and prostate specific membrane 
antigens on prostate cancer. Optimized pARMs mediated enhanced and specific 
anti-cancer immune function against lower antigen expressing prostate cancer 
cells compared to an analogous monovalent ARM."
173,"Androgen receptor (AR) and its splice variants (AR-SVs) promote prostate cancer 
(PCa) growth by orchestrating transcriptional reprogramming. Mechanisms by which 
the low complexity and intrinsically disordered primary transactivation domain 
(AF-1) of AR and AR-SVs regulate transcriptional programming in PCa remains 
poorly defined. Using omics, live and fixed fluorescent microscopy of cells, and 
purified AF-1 and AR-V7 recombinant proteins we show here that AF-1 and the 
AR-V7 splice variant form molecular condensates by liquid-liquid phase 
separation (LLPS) that exhibit disorder characteristics such as rapid 
intracellular mobility, coactivator interaction, and euchromatin induction. The 
LLPS and other disorder characteristics were reversed by a class of 
small-molecule-selective AR-irreversible covalent antagonists 
(SARICA) represented herein by UT-143 that covalently and selectively bind to 
C406 and C327 in the AF-1 region. Interfering with LLPS formation with UT-143 or 
mutagenesis resulted in chromatin condensation and dissociation of AR-V7 
interactome, all culminating in a transcriptionally incompetent complex. 
Biochemical studies suggest that C327 and C406 in the AF-1 region are critical 
for condensate formation, AR-V7 function, and UT-143's irreversible AR 
inhibition. Therapeutically, UT-143 possesses drug-like pharmacokinetics and 
metabolism properties and inhibits PCa cell proliferation and tumor growth. Our 
work provides critical information suggesting that clinically important AR-V7 
forms transcriptionally competent molecular condensates and covalently engaging 
C327 and C406 in AF-1, dissolves the condensates, and inhibits its function. The 
work also identifies a library of AF-1-binding AR and AR-SV-selective covalent 
inhibitors for the treatment of PCa."
174,"Adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) therapies suffer from a number of limitations 
(e.g., poor control of solid tumors), and while combining ACT with cytokine 
therapy can enhance effectiveness, this also results in significant side 
effects. Here, we describe a nanotechnology approach to improve the efficacy of 
ACT therapies by metabolically labeling T cells with unnatural sugar 
nanoparticles, allowing direct conjugation of antitumor cytokines onto the T 
cell surface during the manufacturing process. This allows local, concentrated 
activity of otherwise toxic cytokines. This approach increases T cell 
infiltration into solid tumors, activates the host immune system toward a Type 1 
response, encourages antigen spreading, and improves control of aggressive solid 
tumors and achieves complete blood cancer regression with otherwise noncurative 
doses of CAR-T cells. Overall, this method provides an effective and easily 
integrated approach to the current ACT manufacturing process to increase 
efficacy in various settings."
175,"Background: High frequency of Helicobacter pylori infection and the unknown mode 
of transmission prompted us to investigate H. pylori-wild housefly relationship. 
H. pylori causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and stomach cancer. H. pylori 
persists in the gut of the experimentally infected houseflies. The existence of 
H. pylori strains isolated from wild houseflies, on the other hand, has never 
been documented. Methods: In this study, 902 wild houseflies from different 
sites were identified as Musca domestica, then 60 flies were screened by 
traditional microbiological techniques and H. pylori-specific 16S rRNA gene. The 
antibiotic resistance (ART) was investigated phenotypically. Wild housefly gut 
bacterial isolates were further evaluated genotypically to have 23S rRNA gene 
mutation related to clarithromycin resistance. To find efficient therapeutic 
alternatives, the potency of three plant extracts (garlic, ginger, and lemon) 
and the wasp, Vespa orientalis venom was evaluated against H. pylori. The 
cytotoxic effect of the crude wasp venom, the most potent extract, against Vero 
and Colon cancer (Caco2) cell lines was investigated using the 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Results: All 
isolates from houseflies were positive. The isolated bacteria have variable 
resistance to frequently used antibiotics in all isolates. Minimum inhibitory 
concentration values of 15.625 mg/mL for both ginger and lemon extracts, 
7.8125 mg/mL for garlic extract, and 0.0313 mg/mL for wasp venom were recorded. 
Wasp venom has the most potent antibacterial activity compared with the four 
antibiotics that are currently used in therapies against H. pylori. Conclusion: 
We conclude that wild houseflies can play a role in disseminating H. pylori. The 
housefly gut may be a suitable environment for the horizontal transfer of ART 
genes among its associated microbiome and H. pylori. Wasp venom proved its 
potential activity as a new and effective anti-H. pylori drug for both 
therapeutic and preventative usage."
176,"Membrane protein engineering exhibits great potential for cell 
functionalization. Although genetic strategies are sophisticated for membrane 
protein engineering, there still exist some issues, including transgene 
insertional mutagenesis, laborious, complicated procedures, and low tunability. 
Herein, we report a DNA-templated anchoring of exogenous proteins on living cell 
membranes to realize programmable functionalization of living cells. Using DNA 
as a scaffold, the model cell membranes are readily modified with proteins, on 
which the density and ratio of proteins as well as their interactions can be 
precisely controlled through predictable DNA hybridization. Then, the natural 
killer (NK) cells were engineered to gain the ability to eliminate the immune 
checkpoint signaling at the NK-tumor synapse, which remarkably promoted NK cell 
activation in immunotherapy. Given the versatile functions of exogenous proteins 
and flexible designs of programmable DNA, this method has the potential to 
facilitate membrane-protein-based cell engineering and therapy."
177,"Purpose: To explore the surgical techniques and clinical value of pure 
transperitoneal laparoscopic nephroureterectomy (LNU) plus bladder cuff excision 
(BCE) conducted without changing the patient's position in the treatment of 
upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Methods: From August 2018 to July 2021, 
we retrospectively reviewed 66 patients who underwent LNU + BCE in a single 
position. Then, their demographic characteristics, perioperative and 
pathological outcomes, and postoperative follow-up data were evaluated. Results: 
All 66 operations in this group were successfully completed without conversion 
to open surgery. The mean operative time was 125 ± 47 minutes, whereas the 
estimated blood loss was 10 (10, 15) mL. The median postoperative drainage time 
was 4 (3.8, 6.0) days, the time to catheter extraction after the operation was 
4.5 (3.0, 6.0) days, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 6 (5, 7) 
days. Pathological results showed urothelial carcinoma in 65 cases, including 56 
high-grade and 9 low-grade cases. Lymph node metastasis was found in 8 cases of 
high-grade urothelial carcinoma. All the surgical margins were negative. The 
median follow-up was 16.5 (11.0-25.6) months, and there was neither tumor 
recurrence nor distant metastasis. Conclusions: Pure transperitoneal LNU + BCE 
in a single position is a safe and effective minimally invasive technique for 
UTUC and is worthy of clinical application and promotion. It takes advantage of 
a programmed procedure, short operation time, less blood loss, less trauma, and 
quick recovery after the operation. However, multicenter randomized controlled 
studies with large samples are needed to further confirm these findings. Trial 
Registration: The study was registered at Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of 
Medical Sciences (No. 22/054-3255) and the registration date is August 2018."
178,"A pulldown using a biotinylated natural product of interest in the 
17β-hydroxywithanolide (17-BHW) class, physachenolide C (PCC), identified the 
bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family of proteins (BRD2, BRD3, and 
BRD4), readers of acetyl-lysine modifications and regulators of gene 
transcription, as potential cellular targets. BROMOscan bromodomain profiling 
and biochemical assays support PCC as a BET inhibitor with increased selectivity 
for bromodomain (BD)-1 of BRD3 and BRD4, and X-ray crystallography and NMR 
studies uncovered specific contacts that underlie the potency and selectivity of 
PCC toward BRD3-BD1 over BRD3-BD2. PCC also displays characteristics of a 
molecular glue, facilitating proteasome-mediated degradation of BRD3 and BRD4. 
Finally, PCC is more potent than other withanolide analogues and gold-standard 
pan-BET inhibitor (+)-JQ1 in cytotoxicity assays across five prostate cancer 
(PC) cell lines regardless of androgen receptor (AR)-signaling status."
179,"In April 2022, the National Cancer Institute of the United States organized a 
3-day seminar, dedicated to boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). This short 
article summarizes a presentation from that event, which is intended to provide 
an overview of activities currently underway worldwide to make BNCT available 
for patient treatments. This overview does not claim to be exhaustive but shows 
a great deal of activity in all areas necessary for the complex therapy that is 
BNCT. A rapid increase in the number of BNCT centers can be expected over the 
next few years, coupled with the introduction of novel drugs for BNCT. It will 
be a major challenge to all stakeholders to create clinical networks that can 
conduct the necessary prospective clinical trials in a short time and in high 
quality."
180,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of diseases without a 
care standard and show variability in treatment outcomes. This Spanish, 
observational, prospective study ERASME (CEL-SMD-2012-01) assessed the evolution 
of newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve high-risk MDS patients (according to 
IPPS-R). 204 patients were included: median age 73.0 years, 54.4% males, 69.6% 
0-1 ECOG, and 94.6% with comorbidities. Active treatment was the most common 
strategy (52.0%) vs. stem cell transplantation (25.5%) and supportive 
care/watchful-waiting (22.5%). Overall (median) event-free survival was 
7.9 months (9.1, 8.3, and 5.3); progression-free survival: 10.1 months (12.9, 
12.8, and 4.3); and overall survival: 13.8 months (15.4, 14.9; 8.4), 
respectively, with significant differences among groups. Adverse events (AEs) of 
≥3 grade were reported in 72.6% of patients; serious AEs reported in 60.6%. 
33.1% of patients died due to AEs. Three patients developed second primary 
malignant neoplasms (median: 8.2 months). Our study showed better outcomes in 
patients receiving active therapy early after diagnosis."
181,"BACKGROUND: This study used machine learning to develop a 3-year lung cancer 
risk prediction model with large real-world data in a mostly younger population.
METHODS: Over 4.7 million individuals, aged 45-65 years with no history of any 
cancer or lung cancer screening, diagnostic, or treatment procedures, with an 
outpatient visit in 2013 were identified in the Optum® De-identified Electronic 
Health Record (EHR) Dataset. A Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator 
model was fit using all available data in the 365 days prior. Temporal 
validation was assessed with recent data. External validation was assessed with 
data from Mercy Health Systems EHR and Optum® De-Identified Clinformatics Data 
Mart. Racial inequities in model discrimination were assessed with xAUCs.
RESULTS: The model AUC was 0.76. Top predictors included age, smoking, race, 
ethnicity, and diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The model 
identified a high-risk group with lung cancer incidence 9 times the average 
cohort incidence, representing 10% of lung cancer patients. Model performed well 
temporally and externally, while performance was reduced for Asians and 
Hispanics.
CONCLUSIONS: A high-dimensional model trained using big data identified a subset 
of patients with high lung cancer risk. The model demonstrated transportability 
to EHR and claims data, while underscoring the need to assess racial disparities 
when using machine learning methods.
IMPACT: This internally and externally validated real-world data-based lung 
cancer prediction model is available on an open-source platform for broad 
sharing and application. Model integration into an EHR system could minimize 
physician burden by automating identification of high-risk patients."
182,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is an established risk factor for colorectal cancer 
(CRC). However, genetically-defined population subgroups may have increased 
susceptibility to smoking-related effects on CRC.
METHODS: A genome-wide interaction scan was performed including 33,756 CRC cases 
and 44,346 controls from three genetic consortia.
RESULTS: Evidence of an interaction was observed between smoking status (ever vs 
never smokers) and a locus on 3p12.1 (rs9880919, p=4.58x10-8), with higher 
associated risk in subjects carrying the GG genotype (OR 1.25, 95%CI 1.20-1.30) 
compared with the other genotypes (OR <1.17 for GA and AA). Among ever smokers, 
we observed interactions between smoking intensity (increase in 10 cigarettes 
smoked per day) and two loci on 6p21.33 (rs4151657, p=1.72x10-8) and 8q24.23 
(rs7005722, p=2.88x10-8). Subjects carrying the rs4151657 TT genotype showed 
higher risk (OR 1.12, 95%CI 1.09-1.16) compared with the other genotypes (OR 
<1.06 for TC and CC). Similarly, higher risk was observed among subjects 
carrying the rs7005722 AA genotype (OR 1.17, 95%CI 1.07-1.28) compared with the 
other genotypes (OR <1.13 for AC and CC). Functional annotation revealed that 
SNPs in 3p12.1 and 6p21.33 loci were located in regulatory regions, and were 
associated with expression levels of nearby genes. Genetic models predicting 
gene expression revealed that smoking parameters were associated with lower CRC 
risk with higher expression levels of CADM2 (3p12.1) and ATF6B (6p21.33).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified novel genetic loci that may modulate the risk 
for CRC of smoking status and intensity, linked to tumor suppression and immune 
response.
IMPACT: These findings can guide potential prevention treatments."
183,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) is a poorly characterized member 
of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family. Functional analysis of the 
ERK3 signaling pathway has been hampered by a lack of knowledge about the 
substrates and downstream effectors of the kinase. Here, we used large-scale 
quantitative phosphoproteomics and targeted gene silencing to identify direct 
ERK3 substrates and gain insight into its cellular functions. Detailed 
validation of one candidate substrate identified the gelsolin/villin family 
member supervillin (SVIL) as a bona fide ERK3 substrate. We show that ERK3 
phosphorylates SVIL on Ser245 to regulate myosin II activation and cytokinesis 
completion in dividing cells. Depletion of SVIL or ERK3 leads to increased 
cytokinesis failure and multinucleation, a phenotype rescued by wild type SVIL 
but not by the non-phosphorylatable S245A mutant. Our results unveil a new 
function of the atypical MAP kinase ERK3 in cell division and the regulation of 
cell ploidy."
184,"BACKGROUND: Cytopathologic analysis is feasible and provides detailed 
morphological characterisation of head and neck lesions.
AIMS: To integrate the available data published on fine-needle aspiration 
cytology (FNAC) used for the diagnosis of plasma cell neoplasms (PCN) of the 
head and neck region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Searches on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus 
were performed to compile data from case reports/case series published in 
English. The Joanna Briggs Institute tool was used for the critical appraisal of 
studies.
RESULTS: A total of 82 studies comprising 102 patients were included in this 
review. There was a predilection for men (68.6%) (male/female ratio: 2.1:1). 
Individuals in their 50s (29.4%), 60s (22.5%), and 70s (22.5%) were more often 
affected. The thyroid gland (26.2%) was the main anatomical location, followed 
by scalp (15.5%), neck/cervical region (15.5%), jaws (13.6%), and major salivary 
glands (13.6%). For FNAC analysis, a smear was employed in 41 (40.6%) cases and 
a cell block was used in four (3.9%). In 56 (55.4%) reports, no cytological 
methods were available. Morphologically, 34 (56.7%) cases had a diagnosis of PCN 
with agreement between cytopathology and histopathology. The rate of wrong 
diagnoses when using cytology was 27.5%. Immunophenotyping was performed in 49 
(48%) of the cases. The 69-month disease-free survival rate was 60.2%, while the 
27-month overall survival rate was 64.1%.
CONCLUSION: This study reinforces that FNAC can be an ancillary tool in the 
first step towards the diagnosis of PCN of the head and neck region, especially 
when applying a cell block for cytological analysis."
185,"PURPOSE: The feasibility of a deep learning-based markerless real-time tumor 
tracking (RTTT) method was retrospectively studied with orthogonal kV X-ray 
images and clinical tracking records acquired during lung cancer treatment.
METHODS: Ten patients with lung cancer treated with marker-implanted RTTT were 
included. The prescription dose was 50 Gy in four fractions, using seven- to 
nine-port non-coplanar static beams. This corresponds to 14-18 X-ray tube angles 
for an orthogonal X-ray imaging system rotating with the gantry. All patients 
underwent 10 respiratory phases four-dimensional computed tomography. After a 
data augmentation approach, for each X-ray tube angle of a patient, 2250 
digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) images with gross tumor volume (GTV) 
contour labeled were obtained. These images were adopted to train the patient 
and X-ray tube angle-specific GTV contour prediction model. During the testing, 
the model trained with DRR images predicted GTV contour on X-ray projection 
images acquired during treatment. The predicted three-dimensional (3D) positions 
of the GTV were calculated based on the centroids of the contours in the 
orthogonal images. The 3D positions of GTV determined by the marker-implanted 
RTTT during the treatment were considered as the ground truth. The 3D deviations 
between the prediction and the ground truth were calculated to evaluate the 
performance of the model.
RESULTS: The median GTV volume and motion range were 7.42 (range, 1.18-25.74) 
cm3 and 22 (range, 11-28) mm, respectively. In total, 8993 3D position 
comparisons were included. The mean calculation time was 85 ms per image. The 
overall median value of the 3D deviation was 2.27 (interquartile range: 
1.66-2.95) mm. The probability of the 3D deviation smaller than 5 mm was 93.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation results and calculation efficiency show the proposed 
deep learning-based markerless RTTT method may be feasible for patients with 
lung cancer."
186,"Background: Medical marijuana (MM) and cannabidiol (CBD) have received 
increasing attention to manage pain and other symptoms even with limited 
scientific evidence. Objectives: We examined the attitudes and beliefs of health 
care providers toward MM and CBD compared to standard treatments for 
cancer-associated pain and various symptoms. Design: Two sets of anonymous 
surveys (MM and CBD) containing similar items were completed by clinicians of 
four symptom-focused specialties. Results: A minority of respondents preferred 
recommending MM (9%) and CBD (13%), respectively, over opioids for cancer pain, 
while 11% and 22% felt that MM and CBD, respectively, would be useful to combine 
with opioids to treat cancer pain. Respondents did not favor MM or CBD over 
common treatment options for nonpain symptoms. Conclusion: MM and CBD were not 
preferred over current standard treatments for pain and other symptoms. 
Responses from the four specialties aligned with unique aspects of their 
clinical practice."
187,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Systemic inflammation is well-recognized to be associated 
with ulcerative colitis (UC), but whether these effects are causal or 
consequential remains unclear. We aimed to define potential causal relationship 
of cytokine dysregulation with different tiers of evidence.
METHODS: We firstly synthesized serum proteomic profiling data from two 
multi-centered observational studies, in which a panel of systemic inflammatory 
proteins was analyzed to examine their associations with UC risk. To further 
dissect observed associations, we then performed a bidirectional two-sample 
Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis from both forward and reverse directions 
using five genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary level data for serum 
proteomic profiles and the largest GWAS of 28,738 European-ancestry individuals 
for UC risk.
RESULTS: Pooled analysis of serum proteomic data identified 14 proteins to be 
associated with the risk of UC. Forward MR analysis using only cis-acting 
protein quantitative trait loci (cis-pQTLs) or trans-pQTLs further validated 
causal associations of two chemokines and the increased risk of UC: C-X-C motif 
chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9) (OR, 1.45, 95% CI, 1.08-1.95, P=.012) and C-C motif 
chemokine ligand 11 (CCL11) (OR, 1.14, 95%CI: 1.09-1.18, P=3.89×10  -10). Using 
both cis- and trans-acting pQTLs, an association of caspase-8 (CASP8) (OR, 1.04, 
95% CI, 1.03-1.05, P= 7.63×10  -19) was additionally identified. Reverse MR did 
not find any influence of genetic predisposition to UC on any of these three 
inflammation proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing elevated levels of CXCL9, CCL11 and CASP8 may play a 
role in the pathogenesis of UC."
188,"BACKGROUND: The hyperglycemia condition disrupts the metabolism of 
nitrate/nitrite and nitric oxide, and dietary nitrate intake can restore nitric 
oxide homeostasis. This study aims to examine whether urinary nitrate is 
associated with diabetes complications and long-term survival among people with 
hyperglycemia.
METHODS: A total of 6208 people with hyperglycemia who participated in the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2005 to 2014 were 
enrolled. Diabetes complications included congestive heart failure, coronary 
heart disease, angina, stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetic retinopathy, and 
nephropathy. Mortality wasobtained from the National Death Index until 2015. 
Urinary nitrate was measured by ion chromatography coupled with electrospray 
tandem mass spectrometry, which was log-transformed and categized into tertiles. 
Logistic regression models and cox proportional hazards models were respectively 
performed to assess the association of urinary nitrate with the risk of diabetes 
complications and disease-specific mortalities.
RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders including urinary 
perchlorate and thiocyanate, compared with the participants in the lowest 
tertile of nitrate, the participants in the highest tertile had lower risks of 
congestive heart failure(odd-ratio[OR] = 0.41, 95%CI:0.27-0.60) and diabetic 
nephropathy(OR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.41-0.62). Meanwhile, during a total follow-up of 
41,463 person-year, the participants in the highest tertile had lower mortality 
risk of all-cause(hazard-ratio[HR] = 0.78, 95%CI:0.62-0.97), cardiovascular 
disease(CVD)(HR = 0.56, 95%CI:0.37-0.84) and diabetes(HR = 0.47, 
95%CI:0.24-0.90), which showed dose-dependent linear relationships(P for 
non-linearity > 0.05). Moreover, no association between nitrate and cancer 
mortality was observed(HR = 1.13, 95%CI:0.71-1.80).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher urinary nitrate is associated with lower risk of congestive 
heart failure and diabetic nephropathy, and lower risk of all-cause, CVD, and 
diabetes mortalities. These findings indicated that inorganic nitrate 
supplementation can be considered as a supplementary treatment for people with 
hyperglycemia."
189,"Background: The Emergency Department (ED) has increasingly been recognized as an 
important site of care for older adults with unmet palliative care needs. 
Despite this, no clear model of care delivery has emerged. Aim: To assess the 
acceptability and feasibility of a scripted palliative care communication 
intervention in the ED directed by social workers. We hypothesized that the 
intervention would be feasible, acceptable to patients and ED social workers, 
and that the collection of patient outcomes would be possible. Design: A 
prospective, unblinded, pilot randomized clinical trial of older adults with 
serious illness presenting to the ED. Patients were randomized to either receive 
a social worker-directed palliative care intervention (n-65), which consisted of 
a conversation focused on patients' goals, values, hopes and worries, or to 
usual care (n-52). The intervention was evaluated for feasibility and 
acceptability. Results: Of patients randomized to the intervention arm, 66% 
(43/65) completed a conversation with the social worker. Focus group feedback 
with the social workers further demonstrated the feasibility of these 
conversations. There was minimal (12%) loss to follow-up. Of the patients who 
received the intervention, the majority reported that they appreciated the 
social workers bringing up their goals for the future (77%), their social 
workers asking about their fears and worries (72%), and they liked the way the 
conversation was set up (81%). Social workers administered 95% of the 
conversation components. Conclusions: This pilot trial demonstrated the 
feasibility and acceptability of a social worker-directed, scripted palliative 
care communication intervention in a single urban, academic ED."
190,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated racial disparities in breast 
cancer treatment and secondary lymphedema. However, no studies have yet examined 
the effects of race and socioeconomic status on physiological surgical treatment 
for lymphedema. The authors aimed to evaluate whether disparities exist within 
patients seeking physiological surgical lymphedema treatment.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of patients presenting for 
physiological surgical treatment of lymphedema from 2013 to 2019. Data on 
demographics, medical history, socioeconomic factors, lymphedema, and treatments 
were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 789 patients (712 women and 77 men) seeking physiological 
surgical treatment of lymphedema were selected. Their mean age was 54.4 ± 13.4 
years. A total of 620 patients (78.5%) self-reported as White, 120 (15.2%) as 
Black, 17 (2.2%) as Asian, five (0.6%) as Hispanic, and eight (2.4%) as 
multiracial. A total of 566 patients (71.7%) met criteria for surgical 
candidacy. White race was associated with increased rates of surgical candidacy 
compared with Black race (46.6% versus 77.2%; P < 0.0001). Compared with White 
patients, Black patients presented with a longer symptom duration (11.07 versus 
6.99 years; P < 0.001), had a higher body mass index (mean, 34.5 versus 28.1; P 
< 1 × 10 -10 ), had a higher International Society of Lymphology stage ( P < 
0.05), and were less likely to have maximized medical treatment for lymphedema 
(30.8% versus 55.4%; P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates racial disparities in patients seeking 
physiological surgical treatment for lymphedema. Black patients present later 
with more severe disease, receive less nonsurgical treatment before 
consultation, and are less likely to meet criteria for physiological surgery. 
Improved patient and provider education on lymphedema and appropriate diagnosis 
and nonsurgical treatment is of primary importance to address this disparity."
191,"SUMMARY: The medial femoral condyle flap is well-described for reconstruction of 
small bone defects of the upper and lower extremities. There are limited case 
reports of its use in other anatomic sites, particularly for reconstruction of 
complex head and neck defects. In the setting of previous radiation and 
contaminated fields, vascularized bone is generally preferred to bone grafts, 
cadaveric allografts, or synthetic implants. The authors present a case series 
of complex craniofacial defects involving the midface that were reconstructed 
using medial femoral condyle flaps, focusing on the type of defect and lessons 
learned from their early experience to promote awareness of this flap among 
microsurgeons, who may wish to consider the potential of this flap and 
incorporate its use into their armamentarium.
CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV."

193,"IMPORTANCE: Treatment at high-volume centers (HVCs) has been associated with 
improved overall survival (OS) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC); however, it is unclear how patterns of referral affect these findings.
OBJECTIVE: To understand the relative contributions of treatment site and 
selection bias in driving differences in outcomes in patients with PDAC and to 
characterize socioeconomic factors associated with referral to HVCs.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: A population-based retrospective review of the 
Oregon State Cancer Registry was performed from 1997 to 2019 with a median 4.3 
months of follow-up. Study participants were all patients diagnosed with PDAC in 
Oregon from 1997 to 2018 (n = 8026).
EXPOSURES: The primary exposures studied were diagnosis and treatment at HVCs 
(20 or more pancreatectomies for PDAC per year), low-volume centers ([LVCs] less 
than 20 per year), or both.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: OS and treatment patterns (eg, receipt of 
chemotherapy and primary site surgery) were evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis 
and logistic regression, respectively.
RESULTS: Eight thousand twenty-six patients (male, 4142 [52%]; mean age, 71 
years) were identified (n = 3419 locoregional, n = 4607 metastatic). Patients 
receiving first-course treatment at a combination of HVCs and LVCs demonstrated 
improved median OS for locoregional and metastatic disease (16.6 [95% CI, 
15.3-17.9] and 6.1 [95% CI, 4.9-7.3] months, respectively) vs patients receiving 
HVC only (11.5 [95% CI, 10.7-12.3] and 3.9 [95% CI, 3.5-4.3] months, 
respectively) or LVC-only treatment (8.2 [95% CI, 7.7-8.7] and 2.1 [95% CI, 
1.9-2.3] months, respectively; all P < .001). No differences existed in disease 
burden by volume status of diagnosing institution. When stratifying by site of 
diagnosis, HVC-associated improvements in median OS were smaller (locoregional: 
10.4 [95% CI, 9.5-11.2] vs 9.9 [95% CI, 9.4-10.4] months; P = .03; metastatic: 
3.6 vs 2.7 months, P < .001) than when stratifying by the volume status of 
treating centers, indicating selection bias during referral. A total of 94% 
(n = 1103) of patients diagnosed at an HVC received HVC treatment vs 18% 
(n = 985) of LVC diagnoses. Among patients diagnosed at LVCs, later year of 
diagnosis and higher estimated income were independently associated with higher 
odds of subsequent HVC treatment, while older age, metastatic disease, and 
farther distance from HVC were independently associated with lower odds.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: LVC-to-HVC referrals for PDAC experienced improved OS 
vs HVC- or LVC-only care. While disease-related features prompting referral may 
partially account for this finding, socioeconomic and geographic disparities in 
referral worsen OS for disadvantaged patients. Measures to improve access to 
HVCs are encouraged."

195,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a trivalent genetically engineered inactivated Escherichia 
coli vaccine (K88ac-3STa-LTB) that neutralizes the STa toxin by targeting 
fimbriae and entertoxins for the treatment of enterotoxigenic E coli.
ANIMALS: 18- to 22-g mice, rabbits, pregnant sows.
PROCEDURES: Using PCR, the K88ac gene and LTB gene were cloned separately from 
the template C83902 plasmid. At the same time, the 3 STa mutant genes were also 
amplified by using the gene-directed mutation technology. Immune protection 
experiments were performed, and the minimum immune dose was determined in mice 
and pregnant sows.
RESULTS: The ELISA test could be recognized by the STa, LTB, and K88ac 
antibodies. Intragastric administration in the suckling mouse confirmed that the 
protein had lost the toxicity of the natural STa enterotoxin. The results of the 
immune experiments showed that K88ac-3STa-LTB protein could stimulate rabbits to 
produce serum antibodies and neutralize the toxicity of natural STa enterotoxin. 
The efficacy test of the K88ac-3STa-LTB-inactivated vaccine showed that the 
immune protection rate of the newborn piglets could reach 85% on the first day 
after suckling. At the same time, it was determined that the minimum 
immunization doses for mice and pregnant sows were 0.2 and 2.5 mL, respectively.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This research indicates that the K88ac-3STa-LTB trivalent 
genetically engineered inactivated vaccine provides a broad immune spectrum for 
E coli diarrhea in newborn piglets and prepares a new genetically engineered 
vaccine candidate strain for prevention of E coli diarrhea in piglets."
196,"Background: Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) is a common peripheral 
neuropathy subtype. We aimed to determine the association between breastfeeding 
and DSP among postmenopausal women aged 40-70 years, and the effect modification 
of obesity on this association. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted 
using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004. 
Postmenopausal women aged 40-70 years were included. Women with diabetes, 
stroke, cancer, cardiovascular disease, thyroid disease, liver disease, 
weak/failing kidneys, or amputation were excluded. Binary logistic regression 
was used to analyze the association between breastfeeding and DSP. Results: 
Among 798 participants, 386 (44.30%) reported breastfeeding history and 51 
(5.29%) were defined as having DSP using the monofilament test. A significant 
inverse association was observed between breastfeeding and DSP (odds ratio 
[OR] = 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11-0.79; p = 0.017) after adjusting 
for other confounding variables. In subgroup analysis, this adjusted association 
was observed only in the obese group (OR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.06-0.73, p = 0.013). 
Conclusions: Breastfeeding was found to have potential benefits in the presence 
of DSP in postmenopausal women aged 40-70 years, and obesity modified the 
association between breastfeeding and DSP. Promoting breastfeeding may reduce 
the burden of peripheral neuropathy in middle-aged postmenopausal women."
197,"The effects of combined administration of red ginseng (RG) extracts and 
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on immunostimulatory activity and tumor 
metastasis inhibition were investigated in mice. For the immunostimulatory 
activity, splenocyte proliferation, natural killer (NK) cell activity, including 
the production of granzyme B (GrB) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and serum level 
of cytokine such as IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-17, and IL-21 were assessed. Peyer's 
patch cells obtained from mice administered with RG+GABA were cultured, and the 
cytokine level in the culture supernatant and bone marrow (BM) cell 
proliferation activity were examined. The proliferative activity of splenocytes 
was significantly higher in the RG-GABA treatment group than in RG or GABA alone 
(P < .05). In the experimental tumor metastasis model, oral administration of 
RG+GABA showed a higher antitumor metastatic effect compared to that of RG or 
GABA alone. Oral administration of RG+GABA significantly augmented NK 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity against YAC-1 tumor cells. In addition, the 
production of GrB and IFN-γ was stimulated in the culture supernatant of NK 
cells and YAC-1 cells. Serum concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-21 in mice 
with RG+GABA were significantly higher compared to the corresponding blood 
levels in mice administered with RG or GABA alone. The RG+GABA group showed 
significant BM cell proliferation and increased production of IL-6 and 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor compared to that in the 
monotherapy groups. Therefore, RG may have a synergistic effect with GABA for 
enhancing the host defense system such as BM proliferation and NK cell activity 
in a tumor metastasis model."
198,"Background: Circular RNAs (circ-RNAs) have been demonstrated to influence 
initiation, drug resistance, and metastasis of tumors. However, the effects of 
circular-phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (circ-PGAM1) on matrine resistance in 
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unknown. Materials and Methods: The 
reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used 
to determine gene expression. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP 
nick end labeling (TUNEL) and cell colony formation assays were used to evaluate 
NSCLC apoptosis and cell proliferation after indicated treatments, respectively. 
Results: circ-PGAM1 was upregulated in human NSCLC cell lines (H1299 and A549) 
compared with the human normal lung epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells. circ-PGAM1 
overexpression reversed the matrine treatment-induced inhibition on 
proliferation of NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) and rescued the matrine 
treatment-stimulated apoptosis of these cells. miR-326 was demonstrated to 
interact with circ-PGAM1. circ-PGAM1 knockdown enhanced the antitumor effect of 
matrine on NSCLC cell proliferation and apoptosis, which was reversed by miR-326 
inhibition. The authors also identified CXCR5 as a key downstream target of 
miR-326 in A549 cells. Conclusions: circ-PGAM1 enhances matrine resistance of 
NSCLC cells through the miR-326/CXCR5 axis. The authors' findings provide new 
insights into NSCLC-targeted therapy."
199,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Post radiation mucosal ulcers (PRMU) after treatment for 
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) can have a huge negative impact on 
patients' quality of life, but little is known concerning risk factors and the 
impact of fraction size. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the 
pattern of PRMU development and to identify risk factors after a 
hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy boost (SBRT) compared to 
conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for OPSCC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study (N = 332) of 
OPSCC patients with ≥ 1-year disease-free survival, treated with 46 Gy Intensity 
Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) (2 Gy fractions) followed by either an SBRT boost 
of 16.5 Gy (5.5 Gy fractions) (N = 180), or 24 Gy IMRT (2 Gy fractions) 
(N = 152). PRMU (grade ≥ 2) was scored when observed > three months after the 
last radiotherapy (RT) fraction (CTCAE v5.0). Potential risk factors were 
analyzed with Cox regression models using death as competing risk. Dose at the 
PRMU site was calculated by projecting delineated PRMU on the planning CT.
RESULTS: All cases of PRMU (N = 64) occurred within 24 months; all were grade 2. 
The cumulative incidence at 2 years in the SBRT boost group was 26% (N = 46) vs. 
12% (N = 18) for conventional fractionation (p = 0.003). Most PRMU developed 
within nine months (N = 48). PRMU occurring > nine months (N = 16) were mainly 
observed in the SBRT boost group (N = 15). Sex (p = 0.048), acute tube feeding 
(p = < 0.001), tumor subsite tonsil (p = 0.001), and N stage (p = 0.017) were 
associated with PRMU risk at multivariable regression in the hypofractionated 
SBRT boost group. All 25 delineated PRMU were located within the high dose 
regions.
CONCLUSION: The risk of PRMU should be included in the cost benefit analysis 
when considering future research using a hypofractionated SBRT boost for OPSCC 
patients."
200,"Plain Language Summary: This cohort study estimates state-level changes in 
cigarette sales in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic."
201,"IMPORTANCE: Lung cancer screening with chest computed tomography (CT) prevents 
lung cancer death; however, fewer than 5% of eligible Americans are screened. 
CXR-LC, an open-source deep learning tool that estimates lung cancer risk from 
existing chest radiograph images and commonly available electronic medical 
record (EMR) data, may enable automated identification of high-risk patients as 
a step toward improving lung cancer screening participation.
OBJECTIVE: To validate CXR-LC using EMR data to identify individuals at 
high-risk for lung cancer to complement 2022 US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services (CMS) lung cancer screening eligibility guidelines.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study compared CXR-LC 
estimates with CMS screening guidelines using patient data from a large US 
hospital system. Included participants were persons who currently or formerly 
smoked cigarettes with an outpatient posterior-anterior chest radiograph between 
January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014, with no history of lung cancer or 
screening CT. Data analysis was performed between May 2021 and June 2022.
EXPOSURES: CXR-LC lung cancer screening eligibility (previously defined as 
having a 3.297% or greater 12-year risk) based on inputs (chest radiograph 
image, age, sex, and whether currently smoking) extracted from the EMR.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 6-year incident lung cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 14 737 persons were included in the study population (mean 
[SD] age, 62.6 [6.8] years; 7154 [48.5%] male; 204 [1.4%] Asian, 1051 [7.3%] 
Black, 432 [2.9%] Hispanic, 12 330 [85.2%] White) with a 2.4% rate of incident 
lung cancer over 6 years (361 patients with cancer). CMS eligibility could be 
determined in 6277 patients (42.6%) using smoking pack-year and quit-date from 
the EMR. Patients eligible by both CXR-LC and 2022 CMS criteria had a high rate 
of lung cancer (83 of 974 patients [8.5%]), higher than those eligible by 2022 
CMS criteria alone (5 of 177 patients [2.8%]; P < .001). Patients eligible by 
CXR-LC but not 2022 CMS criteria also had a high 6-year incidence of lung cancer 
(121 of 3703 [3.3%]). In the 8460 cases (57.4%) where CMS eligibility was 
unknown, CXR-LC eligible patients had a 5-fold higher rate of lung cancer than 
ineligible (127 of 5177 [2.5%] vs 18 of 2283 [0.5%]; P < .001). Similar results 
were found in subgroups, including female patients and Black persons.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Using routine chest radiographs and other data 
automatically extracted from the EMR, CXR-LC identified high-risk individuals 
who may benefit from lung cancer screening CT."
202,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Urinary bladder recurrences (UBRs) after radical 
nephroureterectomy (RNUx) are a known challenge in patients with upper-tract 
urothelial cancers (UTUCs). We aim to assess factors associated with UBR and 
clonal-relatedness with resected UTUC.
METHODS: Patients who underwent RNUx for UTUC between 1998 and 2015 in five 
institutions were identified. Clonal relatedness between primary UTUC and 
subsequent UBR in a sub-cohort was assessed using next-generation sequencing. A 
Kaplan-Meier curve was used to assess differences in UBR between two groups 
(with or without ureteroscopic biopsy).
RESULTS: Of 267 patients with complete records, 73 (27.3%) had UBR during 
follow-up. The five-year UBR-free survival in all patients was 64.7%. The 
five-year UBR-free-survival was inferior in patients who underwent URS biopsy 
compared with patients who did not undergo ureteroscopic biopsy (49.9% vs 76.4%, 
p < 0.001). History of bladder tumour (HR, 95% CI; 2.94, 1.73-5.00, p < 0.001), 
ureteroscopic biopsy (HR, 95% CI; 2.21, 1.38-3.53, p = 0.001) and preoperative 
urine cytology ≥C3 (HR, 95% CI; 2.06, 1.24-3.40, p = 0.005) were independently 
associated with UBR. Patients with ureteroscopic biopsy (n = 3/5) showed 
identical mutational changes for common genes (TP53 and FGFR3) between primary 
UTUC and subsequent UBR.
CONCLUSIONS: Ureteroscopic biopsy of UTUC is a significant risk factor for UBR. 
Qualitative clonality assessment showed identical mutational signatures between 
primary UTUC and UBR."
203,"PURPOSE: Dual-specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) inactivates factors in the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, activated in uveal 
melanoma (UM) by mutations in upstream G-protein α subunits GNAQ/11 in >90% 
cases. This study examined whether DUSP4 (1) protein expression in primary UM 
(pUM) was a biomarker of metastatic risk and (2) knockdown sensitized UM cells 
to therapeutic agents, selumetinib or doxorubicin.
METHODS: DUSP4 mRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and DUSP4 protein 
expression examined using immunohistochemistry in 28 cases of pUM were evaluated 
for association with clinical, genetic, and histological features. In vitro 
cytotoxic drug assays tested the efficacy of selumetinib and doxorubicin in UM 
cell lines with/without small interfering RNA DUSP4 gene silencing.
RESULTS: DUSP4 protein expression was observed in 93% of cases, with strong 
nuclear positivity in 79%. Despite higher DUSP4 messenger RNA levels in disomy 
3/wild-type BAP1 UM, there was no significant association of nDUSP4 protein with 
these metastatic risk predictors or outcome. DUSP4 expression in UM cell lines 
varied. DUSP4 silencing in Mel202, MP46, and MP41 cells did not affect ERK1/2 or 
phospho-ERK levels. Despite increased phospho-ERK levels in Mel285, no cell line 
showed enhanced sensitivity to selumetinib/doxorubicin.
CONCLUSIONS: DUSP4 protein expression is not a biomarker of UM metastatic risk. 
DUSP4 plays a complex role in oncogenesis, as reported in other cancers, and 
further work is required to fully understand its functional role in the MAPK 
pathway.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the role of phosphatases, such as DUSP4, 
in the control of intracellular signaling cascades will facilitate our ability 
to identify successful treatment options."
204,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of 
gallium-68-prostate specific membrane antigen (68Ga-PSMA) positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in detecting metastases in prostate 
cancer (PCa) patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of studies published 
before August 2021 in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases was 
conducted.The methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment 
of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. Studies investigating the diagnostic 
value of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT were selected for qualitative and quantitative 
analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-five articles using 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for detecting metastases in 
PCa patients were selected for qualitative analysis, 16 of which were selected 
for meta-analysis. The sensitivities of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in detecting lymph node 
metastases ranged from 33.3% to 96.08%, with high specificities ranged from 82% 
to 100%. Gallium-68-PSMA PET/CT demonstrated outstanding diagnostic performance 
in PCa patients with bone metastases. Only two articles about 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT 
for lung metastases showed that the detection value was limited. It was 
difficult to distinguish lung metastases in PCa patients from benign lesions or 
primary lung cancer. There was only one article about 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for liver 
metastases, which showed that about 77.7% of metastatic lesions will be 
68Ga-PSMA-positive and 22.3% will be false negatives. Due to the lack of 
articles on PCa visceral metastases, we only conducted a meta-analysis on lymph 
node metastases and bone metastases. In our meta-analysis, the per-patient 
pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative 
likelihood ratio (LR-), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and the area under the ROC 
curve (AUC) of lymph node metastases were 0.61, 0.96, 14.4, 0.41, 35, and 0.95, 
respectively. The per-lesion pooled sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR-, DOR, and 
AUC of V were 0.74, 0.99, 76.0, 0.26, 289 and 0.99, respectively. The 
per-patient pooled sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR-, DOR, and AUC of bone 
metastases were 0.97, 1.00, 1100.1, 0.03, 37490 and 0.98, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Gallium-68-PSMA PET/CT demonstrated outstanding diagnostic 
performance for bone metastases in PCa patients. The majority of lymph node 
metastases, lung metastases, and liver metastases overexpressed PSMA, which 
could be directly detected. However, a considerable number of lesions were false 
negatives."
205,"BACKGROUND: Transcription factor LEF1 is a downstream mediator of the 
Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. It is expressed in dermal papilla and 
surrounding cells in the hair follicle, promoting cell proliferation and 
differentiation.
RESULTS: Here we report that LEF1 is also expressed all through the hair cycle 
in the terminal Schwann cells (TSCs), a component of the lanceolate complex 
located at the isthmus. The timing of LEF1 appearance at the isthmus coincides 
with that of hair follicle innervation. LEF1 is not found at the isthmus in the 
aberrant hair follicles in nude mice. Instead, LEF1 in TSCs is found in the de 
novo hair follicles reconstituted on nude mice by stem cells chamber graft 
assay. Cutaneous denervation experiment demonstrates that the LEF1 expression in 
TSCs is independent of nerve endings. At last, LEF1 expression in the 
interfollicular epidermis during the early stage of skin development is 
significantly suppressed in transgenic mice with TCF3 overexpression.
CONCLUSION: We reveal the expression dynamics of LEF1 in skin during development 
and hair cycle. LEF1 expression in TSCs indicates that the LEF1/Wnt signal might 
help to establish a niche at the isthmus region for the lanceolate complex, the 
bulge stem cells and other neighboring cells. This article is protected by

206,"Hepatoblastoma is the most common type of hepatic tumors occurring in children 
between 0 and 5 years. And the exact pathophysiology of the disease is still 
mysterious. Accumulating studies on LncRNA have shown its pivotal role in the 
development and progression of distinct human cancers. However, the role of 
LINC01023 in hepatoblastoma is unknown. The relative expression of LINC01023, 
miR-378a-5p, and Wnt3 on hepatoblastoma tissue and cell lines was determined by 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The effect of LINC01023 
downregulation and upregulation on cell proliferation, colony formation and 
apoptosis activities in HUH6 and HepG2 Cells was assessed by CKK8, clonogenic 
and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Dual luciferase, RNA 
immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull-down were performed to confirm the 
interaction between LINC01023 and miR-378a-5p. Similarly, Dual luciferase assay 
was performed to confirmed the interaction between Wnt3 and miR-378a-5p. The 
xenograft tumorgenicity test was performed to elucidate the tumorgenicity 
potential of LINC01023. LINC01023 was significantly upregulated in 
hepatoblastoma tissue and cell lines rather than in adjacent normal hepatic 
tissue and QSG7701 cell lines. LINC01023 silencing attenuated cell 
proliferation, colony formation and increased cell apoptosis. Conversely, 
LINC01023 upregulation results in significant increase in cell proliferation, 
and colony formation activities however, a significant reduction in apoptosis 
activity was reported. Interaction between the LINC01023 and WNT3 was confirmed 
by dual luciferase assay. Xenograft animal tumorgenicity test confirmed the 
in-vivo tumorigenesis potential of LINC01203. To the best of our knowledge, this 
study is the first study demonstrating the role of LINC01023 in hepatoblastoma 
tumorigenesis through the LINC01023/miR-378a-5p/Wnt3 axis. It could be a 
potential therapeutic target and a prognostic biomarker in hepatoblastoma."
207,"Necroptosis is a promising novel target for cervical cancer therapy. 
Nevertheless, differentially expressed necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) in 
cervical cancer and their associations with prognosis are far from fully 
clarified. In this study, differentially expressed NRGs (DE-NRGs) were screened 
out and their bio-function was elucidated. Subsequently, a prognostic scoring 
model based on the regression coefficients of the screened out NRGs and their 
corresponding mRNA expressions were constructed and validated. Finally, the 
survival probability of cervical cancer patients based on the constructed 
prognostic scoring model in 3 and 5 years was predicted and assessed. We found 
17 DE-NRGs in cervical cancer tissues which were closely related to cancer 
progression, and most of them were significantly highly expressed. Furthermore, 
3 NRG were confirmed as the prognostic signature genes from 17 DE-NRGs by 
regression analysis. Overall survival predicted through our prognostic scoring 
model was lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group (p < 0.05) in 
both the TCGA cohort and the external GEO44001 validation cohort. What's more, 
the prediction performance of our prognostic scoring models well verified by the 
ROC curve, and the risk score calculated could act as an independent prognostic 
factor for cervical cancer patients. The calibration curve and C-index (0.776) 
of the nomogram analysis suggested that the predictive performance of the 
nomogram was satisfactory. Our study identified and validated a 
necroptosis-related prognostic signature in cervical cancer, which could well 
predict the prognosis for cervical cancer patients."
208,"Adriamycin is widely used as a chemotherapeutic strategy for advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the clinical response was disappointing 
because of the acquired drug resistance with long-term usage. Revealing the 
underlying mechanism could provide promising therapeutics for the drug-resistant 
patients. The recently identified linc-ROR (long intergenic non-protein-coding 
RNA, regulator of reprogramming) has been found to be an oncogene in various 
cancers, and it also demonstrated to mediate drug resistance and metastasis. We 
thereby wonder whether this lincRNA could mediate adriamycin chemoresistance in 
HCC. In this study, linc-ROR was found to be upregulated in adriamycin-resistant 
HCC cells. And its overexpression accelerated epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) program and adriamycin resistance. Conversely, its silence suppressed EMT 
and made HCC cells sensitize to adriamycin in vitro and in vivo. Further 
investigation revealed that linc-ROR physically interacted with AP-2α, mediated 
its stability by a post-translational modification manner, and sequentially 
activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Furthermore, linc-ROR expression was positively 
associated with β-catenin expression in human clinical specimens. Taken 
together, linc-ROR promoted tumorigenesis and adriamycin resistance in HCC via a 
linc-ROR/AP-2α/Wnt/β-catenin axis, which could be developed as a potential 
therapeutic target for the adriamycin-resistant patients."
209,"The specialty of palliative care has evolved over time to provide symptom 
management, psychosocial support, and care planning for patients with cancer 
throughout the disease continuum and in multiple care settings. This review 
examines the delivery and impact of palliative care in the outpatient, 
inpatient, and community-based settings. The article will discuss how these 3 
palliative care settings can work together to optimize patient outcomes under a 
unifying model of palliative care ""anywhere, anytime"" and how to prioritize 
palliative care services when resources are limited. Many patients with advanced 
cancer receive care from each of the 3 branches of palliative care-outpatient, 
inpatient, and community-based settings-at some point along their disease 
trajectory. Early on, outpatient clinics provide longitudinal supportive care 
concurrent with active disease-modifying treatments. Telemedicine appointments 
can serve patients remotely to minimize their need to travel. When patients 
experience functional decline, community-based palliative care services can 
provide support and monitoring for patients at home. When patients develop acute 
symptomatic complications requiring admission, inpatient care consultation teams 
are essential for symptom management and goals-of-care discussions. For patients 
in severe distress, receiving care in a palliative care unit that provides 
intensive symptom control and facilitates complex discharge planning is ideal. 
Under a unifying model of palliative care designed to offer care ""anywhere, 
anytime,"" the 3 branches of palliative care could work in unison to support each 
other, minimize gaps in care, and optimize patient outcomes."
210,"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) performs strongly invasive and poor prognosis, and 
adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type in it. Statistically, the 
5-year survival rate of patients with advanced GBC is less than 5%. Such dismal 
outcome might be caused by chemotherapy resistance and native biology of tumor 
cells, regardless of emerging therapeutic strategies. Early diagnosis, depending 
on biomarkers, receptors and secretive proteins, is more important than clinical 
therapy, guiding the pathologic stage of cancer and the choice of medication. 
Therefore, it is in urgent need to understand the specific pathogenesis of GBC 
and strive to find promising novel biomarkers for early screening in GBC. 
Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs), long non-coding 
RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), are confirmed to participate in 
and regulate the occurrence and development of GBC. Exceptionally, lncRNAs and 
circRNAs could act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) containing binding 
sites for miRNAs and crosstalk with miRNAs to target regulatory downstream 
protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs), thus affecting the expression levels of 
specific proteins to participate in and regulate the development and progression 
of GBC. It follows that ncRNAs may become promising biomarkers and potential 
therapeutic targets for GBC. In this review, we mainly summarize the recent 
research progress of miRNAs and lncRNAs in regulating the development and 
progression of GBC, chemoresistance, and predicting the prognosis of patients, 
and highlight the potential applications of the lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA 
cross-regulatory networks in early diagnosis, chemoresistance, and prognostic 
evaluation, aiming to better understand the pathogenesis of GBC and develop new 
diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."
211,"PURPOSE: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) orchestrate critical roles in human 
tumorigenesis. However, the regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs in tissue-specific 
expressions in breast cancer (BC) remains poorly understood. This study aims to 
investigate lncRNA role and mechanisms in BC.
METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to explore differentially expressed lncRNAs in 
BC and adjacent tissues. H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) chromatin 
immune-precipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data of BC cells from the GEO dataset 
(GSE85158) was retrieved to identify the H3K27ac activated lncRNAs that were 
involved in tumorigenesis. RP11-162G10.5 was selected as the target lncRNA for 
further functional and mechanism study.
RESULTS: In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA RP11-162G10.5, whose 
overexpression was specifically driven by H3K27ac in luminal breast cancer. And 
increased RP11-162G10.5 in BC is correlated with poor patient outcomes. 
RP11-162G10.5 promotes tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. 
Mechanistically, RP11-162G10.5 recruits transcriptional factor YBX1 to the GLO1 
promoter, consequently activating GLO1 transcription to modulate the progression 
of BC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the histone modification-activated lncRNA 
contributes to the oncogenesis of BC. Also, our data reveal a role for 
RP11-162G10.5 in BC tumorigenesis and may supply a strategy for targeting the 
RP11-162G10.5 as a potential biomarker and a therapeutic target for breast 
cancer patients."
212,"BACKGROUND: Several studies of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
have reported a notable therapeutic effect of segmentectomy. However, the 
secondary benefits of lung volume preservation remain unclear. This study aimed 
to investigate the potential benefits of segmentectomy, in terms of its impact 
on postoperative bronchial change.
METHODS: Patients who underwent left-sided upper lobectomy and upper division 
segmentectomy for pStage 0-IA2 NSCLC, were retrospectively analyzed. Degree of 
the left main bronchial deviation was measured by the curvature index (CI), 
determined using computed tomography. Variables, including CI value and 
postoperative rate of change in CI were compared for postoperative cough 
management the lobectomy and segmentectomy groups.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were reviewed. Thirty-seven and 30 patients 
underwent lobectomy and segmentectomy, respectively, without any significant 
differences in baseline and surgical variables. The 5-year overall survival 
rates in the lobectomy and segmentectomy groups were 86.7 and 95.2%, 
respectively (p = 0.437). While there was no significant difference in 
postoperative complications, the rate of change in CI was significantly higher 
in the lobectomy group than in the segmentectomy group (113 vs. 106%, 
p = 0.005). In addition, the analysis based on postoperative cough reveals the 
rate of change in CI to be significantly higher in patients requiring medical 
treatment (p = 0.005). Conclusions Left upper division segmentectomy provides 
satisfactory treatment and relief of postoperative bronchial tortuosity. Our 
study suggests that there is a possibility the mitigation of environmental 
changes in the thoracic cavity may reduce symptoms, thus contributing to an 
improved quality of life."
213,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of chemotherapy on 
invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) and overall survival (OS) in a nationwide 
cohort of patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative/human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, T1abN0 breast cancer.
METHODS: Patients with ER-negative/HER2-negative, T1abN0 breast cancer 
registered in the Danish Breast Cancer Group database between 2007 and 2016 were 
identified. The effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on iDFS and OS was analyzed with 
Cox proportional hazards analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 296 patients were included in the statistical analyses. Of 
these, 235 (79.4%) received chemotherapy and 61 patients (20.6%) did not. 
Patients treated with chemotherapy were significantly younger, had a 
significantly higher proportion of grade 3 tumors, T1b tumors, and tumors of 
ductal subtype. With 7.7 years of median follow-up, treatment with chemotherapy 
was associated with a significant improvement in OS in the adjusted analysis, 
Hazard Ratio 0.35 (95% Confidence Interval (0.15-0.81), p = 0.02), chemotherapy 
vs. no chemotherapy. In the unadjusted analyses, patients with both T1a and T1b 
tumors had significantly improved OS with chemotherapy. At 5 years, OS was 100% 
vs. 94.4% and 93.8% vs. 81.3% for patients with T1a and T1b tumors, 
respectively, chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy. With 4.9 years of median 
follow-up, iDFS was not significantly improved with chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Patients with ER-negative/HER2-negative, T1abN0 breast cancer had 
significantly improved OS when treated with chemotherapy. This improvement was 
significant in patients with both T1a and T1b tumors, respectively. The effect 
was, however, limited in patients with T1a tumors."
214,"INTRODUCTION: Obesity and breast cancer are two major pathologies closely 
associated with increasing incidence and mortality rates, especially amongst 
women. The association between both diseases have been thoroughly discussed but 
much is still to uncover.
AIM: The aim of this study is to analyse tumour characteristics and clinical 
outcomes of overweight and obese women to disclosure potential associations and 
better understand the impact of obesity in breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinicopathological information of 2246 women were 
extracted from the institutional database of comprehensive cancer centre in 
Portugal diagnosed between 2012 and 2016. Women were stratified according to 
body mass index as normal, overweight, and obese. Patients' demographic 
information and tumour features (age, family history, topographic localization, 
laterality, histological type, and receptor status) were taken as independent 
variables and overall survival, tumour stage, differentiation grade and 
bilaterality were considered clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: The main results reveal that overweight and obesity are predominantly 
associated with worse outcomes in breast cancer patients. Obese patients present 
larger (p-value: 0.002; OR 1.422; 95% CI 1.134-1.783) and more poorly 
differentiated tumours (p-value: 0.002; OR 1.480; 95% CI 1.154-1.898) and tend 
to have lower overall survival although without statistical significance 
(p-value: 0.117; OR 1.309; 95% CI 0.934-1.833). Overweighted women are more 
likely to have bilateral breast cancer (p-value: 0.017; OR 3.076; 95% CI 
1.225-7.722) than obese women. The results also reveal that overweight women 
present less distant metastasis (p-value: 0.024; OR 0.525; 95%CI 0.299-0.920). 
Topographic localization and laterality did not achieve statistical 
significance."
215,"A 54-year-old woman with a history of esophageal adenocarcinoma suffered from 
obstructive jaundice after completing esophagectomy with gastric tube 
reconstruction and adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy 1 year. An abdominal 
computed tomography showed that the common bile duct was compressed by 
metastatic lymphadenopathy. She received endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography first but it was failed in cannulation. Then, 
endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS) was performed with a 
partially covered metallic stent placed from the stomach to the left 
intrahepatic duct. Though aspiration pneumonia occurred after the procedure, she 
recovered on the next day. She resumed oral intake since the third day without 
fever or abdominal pain and she was discharged on the seventh day after the 
procedure. This is the second case report of placing a partially covered 
metallic stent through EUS-HGS in a patient with post esophagectomy and gastric 
tube reconstruction and it can be an alternative treatment."
216,"Exosomes have come to the fore in drug delivery systems due to their 
biological-based and immune-suppressing properties. In this study, we 
investigated the effect of doxorubicin loading of exosomes isolated from human 
platelets on breast cancer.Exosomes released from ADP (1 µM)-activated platelets 
were isolated by the ultracentrifugation method, and their size and charge were 
measured with a TEM and zeta sizer. Then doxorubicin (Dox) loading into exosomes 
(PLT-Exo-Dox) was done by electroporation and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cells. 
In exosome characterization, CD62 positivity was higher in platelet pellets, 
while CD9 positivity was higher in released exosomes. The size of PLT-Exo and 
PLT-Exo-Dox was 82.02 ± 5.21 nm and 116 ± 3.73 nm, with a polydispersity index 
of 0.26 ± 0.04 and 0.39 ± 0.06, and the Zeta potential was - 16.45 mV and 
24.07 mV, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency of the preparation was 
86.02 ± 6.16%, with a drug loading capacity of 4.75 ± 0.16 µg/µg of the exosome. 
In MDA-MB-231 cells, PLT-Exo increased cell viability, while PLT-Exo-Dox 
decreased in 24 h. The Annexin-V binding level and Bax gene expression were 
increased in PLT-Exo-Dox and Bcl-2 gene expression was decreased. This study 
will shed light on the development of release systems that can be effective with 
chemotherapeutic agents by using exosomes released by cells in the development 
of personalized treatments."
217,"As a tumor suppressor in lung cancer, FAT atypical cadherin 4 (FAT4) has a 
critical role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the role of 
FAT4 in ceritinib-resistant anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) EMT has not been reported. It is necessary to discuss 
the role of FAT4 in this process and its potential mechanism of interaction. We 
found that the expression level of FAT4 was downregulated markedly in 
ceritinib-resistant NCI-H2228 (H2228/Cer) cells. Jujuboside A, a FAT4 activator, 
diminished EMT and metastasis of H2228/Cer cells. Importantly, autophagy 
inhibition inverted the inhibitory effect of FAT4 activation on EMT. 
Furthermore, we found the regulatory action of FAT4 on autophagy was related to 
proteasome 26S subunit ubiquitin receptor and non-ATPase 4 (PSMD4) and 
proteasome 20S subunit beta 4 (PSMB4), and the inhibitory effect of autophagy on 
EMT might be related to ROS/NF-κB/IκB-α and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. In 
conclusion, FAT4 activation can inhibit the process of EMT in H2228/Cer cells by 
promoting autophagy, which provides a potential target for ceritinib-resistant 
ALK positive NSCLC therapy."
218,"After more than 60 years of intense research in allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT), this therapy has progressed from one that was fraught 
with seemingly insurmountable complications to a standard treatment of patients 
with aplastic anemia. During the 1970s and 1980s, HCT donors were almost 
exclusively HLA-identical siblings. Subsequent advances in the understanding of 
the complexity of the HLA region along with the development of molecular HLA 
typing and the establishment of unrelated volunteer donor registries have 
resulted in an ever-increasing use of such donors. Most recent breakthroughs 
have enabled HLA-haploidentical HCT and, thereby, finding donors for nearly 
every patient. The outstanding outcomes reported with any of the donor options 
have made allogeneic HCT the preferred treatment over immunosuppressive therapy."
219,"Tirabrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor for treating B-cell 
malignancies. We report the final results of a Phase I study of tirabrutinib in 
17 Japanese patients with B-cell malignancies. Patients were administered 
tirabrutinib at a dose of 160 mg, 320 mg, or 480 mg once daily, or 300 mg twice 
daily (N = 3, 3, 4, and 7, respectively). Three patients continued tirabrutinib 
until study completion (November 30, 2020). Adverse events (AEs) occurred in all 
17 patients, with Grade 3-4 AEs in 8 (47.1%), serious AEs in 7 (41.2%), 
drug-related AEs in 16 (94.1%), and Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs in 6 (35.3%). 
Drug-related AEs reported in 3 or more patients were rash, vomiting, 
neutropenia, arthralgia, and malaise. One additional serious AE (benign neoplasm 
of the lung, unrelated to tirabrutinib) occurred after the previous data cutoff 
(January 4, 2018). Tirabrutinib administration and response assessment were 
continued for over 4 years in 4 patients. The overall response rate was 76.5% 
(13/17 patients). The median (range) time to response and duration of response 
were 0.9 (0.9-5.9) months and 2.59 (0.08-5.45) years, respectively. These 
findings demonstrate the long-term safety and efficacy of tirabrutinib in 
Japanese patients with B-cell malignancies.Clinical trial registration:

220,"Previous studies have extensively explored impacts of trace elements on human 
beings and complex relationships with cancers. However, contradictory 
conclusions may be more challenging to explain due to biological specimen 
differences. To investigate the distribution of trace elements inside body, we 
collected serum, whole blood and tissues from 77 patients with esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), as well as serum and whole blood from 100 
healthy individuals, and determined the concentrations of 13 elements (Al, V, 
Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Sr, Cd, and Pb) with inductively coupled 
plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Al, Ni, Cu, Sr, and Cd variations between 
patients and controls were found to be inconsistent in serum and blood. 
Concentrations of Cu, As, Se, and Sr in serum were positively correlated with 
that in whole blood in both case and control group (rs >0.450, P <0.01). 
Elements in serum had a higher accuracy (87.0%) than whole blood (74.0%) in 
classifying ESCC patients and healthy individuals with discriminant analysis. 
As, Cd, and Pb concentrations in cancerous tissues were positively correlated 
with those in normal epithelium (rs =0.397, 0.571, and 0.542, respectively), 
while Mn, Cu, and Se accumulated in malignant tissues, with V, Cr, Co, Ni, Sr, 
and Cd partitioning in normal epithelium (all P <0.05). Thus, certain elements 
in blood, such as Cu, As, Se, and Sr, were useful in assessing element exposure 
burdens and accumulation tendency of some elements (Mn, Cu and Se, etc.) was 
uncovered in tumors. Our investigation demonstrated the variations in trace 
element distribution for frequently used specimens and further evidence of 
etiological mechanism is necessary."
221,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide; 
however, the potentially possible molecular biological mechanism of CRC is still 
not completely comprehended. This study aimed to confirm candidate key hub genes 
involved in the growth and development of CRC and their connection with immune 
infiltration as well as the related pathways. Gene expression data were selected 
from the GEO dataset. Hub genes for CRC were identified on the basis of 
differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
(WGCNA), and LASSO regression. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), 
Gene Ontology (GO), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were applied to 
reveal possible functions of the differential genes. Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) 
was implemented to identify the relationship between immune cells infiltration 
and hub genes. Two hundred and sixty-two differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were identified. Three modules were acquired based on WGCNA, and the blue module 
presented the highest relevance with CRC. Ten hub genes (AQP8, B3GALT5, CDH3, 
CEMIP, CPM, FOXQ1, PLAC8, SCNN1B, SPINK5, and SST) were acquired with LASSO 
analysis as underlying biomarkers for CRC. Compared with normal tissues, CRC 
tissues presented significantly higher numbers of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B 
cells, natural regulatory T (Treg) cells, and monocytes. The functional 
enrichment analyses demonstrated that hub genes were primarily enriched in 
metabolic process, inflammatory-related, and immune-related response. Ten hub 
genes were identified to be involved in the occurrence and development of CRC 
and may be deemed as novel biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and treatment."
222,"OBJECTIVE: RET (rearranged during transfection) kinase, as a transmembrane 
receptor tyrosine kinase, is a therapeutic target for several human cancer such 
as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and thyroid cancer. Pralsetinib is a 
recently approved drug for the treatment of RET-driven NSCLC and thyroid 
cancers. A single point mutation G810C at the C-lobe of the RET kinase causes 
pralsetinib resistance to this non-gatekeeper variant. However, the detailed 
mechanism remains poorly understood.
METHODS: Here, multiple microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, 
molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy 
calculations, and community network analysis were performed to reveal the 
mechanism of pralsetinib resistance to the RET G810C mutant.
RESULTS: The simulations showed that the G810C mutation had a minor effect on 
the overall conformational dynamics of the RET kinase domain. Energetic analysis 
suggested that the G810C mutation reduced the binding affinity of pralsetinib to 
the mutant. Per-residue energy contribution and structural analyses revealed 
that the hydrogen bonding interactions between pralsetinib and the hinge 
residues Glu805 and Ala807 were disrupted in the G810C mutant, which were 
responsible for the decreased binding affinity of pralsetinib to the mutant.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results may provide understanding of the mechanism of 
pralsetinib resistance to the non-gatekeeper RET G810C mutant."
223,"Papillomaviruses (PVs) are host-species-specific and tissue-specific viruses 
that infect a diverse array of vertebrate hosts, including humans and non-human 
primates, with varying pathogenic outcomes. Although primate PVs have been 
studied extensively, no complete genome sequences of PVs from lemurs have been 
determined to date. Saliva samples from three critically endangered, captive 
black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata variegata) at the Duke Lemur 
Center (USA) were analyzed, using high-throughput sequencing, for the presence 
of oral papillomaviruses. We identified three PVs from two individuals, one of 
which had a coinfection with two different PVs. Two of the three PVs share 99.6% 
nucleotide sequence identity, and we have named these isolates ""Varecia 
variegata papillomavirus 1"" (VavPV1). The third PV shares ~63% nucleotide 
sequence identity with VavPV1, and thus, we have named it ""Varecia variegata 
papillomavirus 2"" (VavPV2). Based on their E1 + E2 + L1 protein sequence 
phylogeny, the VavPVs form a distinct clade. This clade likely represents a 
novel genus, with VavPV1 and VavPV2 belonging to two distinct species. Our 
findings represent the first complete genome sequences of PVs found in 
lemuriform primates, with their presence suggesting the potential existence of 
diverse PVs across the over 100 species of lemurs."
224,"Combination therapy as an important treatment option for lung cancer has been 
attracting attention due to the primary and acquired resistance of 
chemotherapeutic drugs in the clinical application. In the present study, as a 
new therapy strategy, concomitant treatment with time-restricted feeding (TRF) 
plus cisplatin (DDP) on lung cancer growth was investigated in DDP-resistant and 
DDP-sensitive lung cancer cells. We first found that TRF significantly enhanced 
the drug susceptibility of DDP in DDP-resistant A549 (A549/DDP) cell line, 
illustrated by reversing the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) values of 
A549/DDP cells to normal level of parental A549 cells. We also found that TRF 
markedly enhanced DDP inhibition on cell proliferation, migration, as well as 
promoted apoptosis compared to the DDP alone group in A549, H460 and A549/DDP 
cells lines. We further revealed that the synergistic anti-tumor effect of 
combined DDP and TRF was greater than that of combined DDP and simulated fasting 
condition (STS), a known anti-tumor cellular medium. Moreover, mRNA sequence 
analysis from A549/DDP cell line demonstrated the synergistic anti-tumor effect 
involved in upregulated pathways in p53 signaling pathway and apoptosis. 
Notably, compared with the DDP alone group, combination of TRF and DDP robustly 
upregulated the P53 protein expression without mRNA level change by regulating 
its stability via promoting protein synthesis and inhibiting degradation, 
revealed by cycloheximide and MG132 experiments. Collectively, our results 
suggested that TRF in combination with cisplatin might be an additional novel 
therapeutic strategy for patients with lung cancer."
225,"BACKGROUND: Although new-onset diabetes has been described in up to 20% of 
patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer, reports regarding new-onset 
diabetes associated with newly developed liver metastasis from pancreatic cancer 
are limited.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with pancreatic tail cancer 
without impaired glycemic control. A curative-intent distal pancreatectomy with 
adjuvant S-1 chemotherapy was performed. Two years after surgery, a high HbA1c 
concentration and solitary liver metastasis were identified on follow-up 
examination. Two major chemotherapy regimens, gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and 
modified FOLFIRINOX, were sequentially administered to the patient; however, his 
carbohydrate 19-9 concentration continued to increase. Because the patient's 
glycemic control rapidly worsened in synchrony with the tumor growth, insulin 
therapy was initiated. Although the liver metastasis was refractory to 
chemotherapy, curative-intent left hepatectomy was performed because only one 
tumor remained. His impaired glycemic control improved immediately after 
surgery, and insulin therapy was terminated. When writing this report (2 years 
after hepatectomy), the patient was alive and recurrence-free.
CONCLUSIONS: New-onset diabetes appeared with the progression of metachronous 
liver metastasis from pancreatic cancer, without recurrence at any other site. 
The patient's diabetic state was improved by resection of the liver tumor, and 
liver metastasis itself was proven to have caused the glucometabolic disorder by 
increasing insulin resistance."
226,"PURPOSE: Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common malignant tumors of 
genitourinary system in men. CACYCLIN binding protein (CACYBP) is involved in 
the progression of a variety of cancers. The aim of this study was to explore 
the expression and functional role of CACYBP in PC.
METHODS: The expression of CACYBP in PC was evaluated by immunohistochemical 
(IHC) staining and qRT-PCR. Subsequently, we established lentivirus-mediated 
CACYBP knockdown in PC cell lines. The biological roles of CACYBP on 
proliferation, apoptosis, cycle distribution, migration and tumor formation of 
PC were investigated by Celigo cell counting assay, flow cytometry, transwell 
assay, wound-healing assay and mice xenograft models, respectively.
RESULTS: CACYBP was highly expressed in PC and was positively correlated with 
the pathological grade of PC patients. Knockdown of CACYBP inhibited 
proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, arrested cell cycle in G2 and suppressed 
migration of PC cell lines in vitro. In addition, CACYBP knockdown weakened the 
tumor growth of PC in vivo. Moreover, addition of p53 inhibitor could 
effectively alleviate the inhibitory effect of CACYBP knockdown on cell 
activity.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that knockdown of CACYBP inhibited the 
proliferation, migration and tumorigenicity of PC, which may serve as a 
potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PC."
227,"Numerous mechanisms involved in promoting cancer cell survival under nutrient 
starvation have been described. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as 
critical players in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, but the role of lncRNAs 
in the progression of CRC under nutrient starvation has not been well clarified. 
Here, we identified a lncRNA, LINC01615, that was significantly upregulated in 
response to serum starvation. LINC01615 can contribute to the adaptation of CRC 
cells to serum-deprived conditions and enhance cell survival under similar 
conditions. LINC01615 activated the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) under serum 
starvation, manifested as decreased ROS production and enhanced nucleotide and 
lipid synthesis. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a key rate-limiting 
enzyme of the PPP, and LINC01615 promoted G6PD expression by competitively 
binding with hnRNPA1 and facilitating G6PD pre-mRNA splicing. Moreover, we also 
found that serum starvation led to METTL3 degradation by inducing autophagy, 
which further increased the stability and level of LINC01615 in a m6A-dependent 
manner. LINC01615 knockdown combined with oxaliplatin achieved remarkable 
antitumor effects in PDO and PDX models. Collectively, our results demonstrated 
a novel adaptive survival mechanism permitting tumor cells to survive under 
limiting nutrient supplies and provided a potential therapeutic target for CRC."
228,"The hypofractionated radiotherapy modality was established to reduce treatment 
durations and enhance therapeutic efficiency, as compared to conventional 
fractionation treatment. However, this modality is challenging because of rigid 
dosimetric constraints. This study aimed to assess the impact of multi-leaf 
collimator (MLC) widths (10 mm and 5 mm) on plan quality during the treatment of 
prostate cancer. Additionally, this study aimed to investigate the impact of the 
MLC mode of energy on the Agility flattening filter (FF), MLC Agility-free 
flattening filter (FFF), and MLCi2 for patients receiving hypofractionated 
radiotherapy. Two radiotherapy techniques; Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy 
(IMRT) and Volumetric Modulated Arc Radiotherapy (VMAT), were used in this 
research. In the present study, computed tomography simulations of ten patients 
(six plans per patient) with localized prostate adenocarcinoma were analyzed. 
Various dosimetric parameters were assessed, including monitor units, treatment 
delivery times, conformity, and homogeneity indices. To evaluate the plan 
quality, dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were estimated for each technique. The 
results demonstrated that the determined dosimetric parameters of planning 
target volume (PTV)p (such as D mean, conformity, and homogeneity index) showed 
greater improvement with MLC Agility FF and MLC Agility FFF than with MLCi2. 
Additionally, the treatment delivery time was reduced in the MLC Agility FF (by 
31%) and MLC Agility FFF (by 10.8%) groups compared to the MLCi2 group. It is 
concluded that for both the VMAT and IMRT techniques, the smaller width (5 mm) 
MLCs revealed better planning target volume coverage, improved the dosimetric 
parameters for PTV, reduced the treatment time, and met the constraints for 
OARs. It is therefore recommended to use 5 mm MLCs for hypofractionated prostate 
cancer treatment due to better target coverage and better protection of OARs."
229,"PURPOSE: Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is associated in nearly 100% with 
persistent high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection. ICC is still one 
of the leading causes for cancer mortality in women worldwide. The 
immunosuppressive influence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the 
immunocompromised period of pregnancy due to tolerance induction against the 
hemiallogeneic fetus, are generally risk factors for acquisition and persistence 
of HR-HPV infections and their progression to precancerous lesions and 
HPV-associated carcinoma.
METHODS: Overall, 81 pregnant women living with HIV (WLWH) were included. A 
medical history questionnaire was used to record clinical and HIV data. 
Participants received cervicovaginal cytological smear, colposcopy and HPV 
testing. HPV test was performed using BSGP5+/6+ PCR with Luminex read-out. The 
HR-HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58 were additionally grouped together 
as high-high-risk HPV (HHR-HPV) for the purpose of risk-adapted analysis.
RESULTS: HR-HPV prevalence was 45.7%. Multiple HPV infections were detected in 
27.2% of participants, of whom all had at least one HR-HPV genotype included. 
HR-HPV16 and HR-HPV52 were the most prevalent genotypes and found when high 
squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) was detected by cytology. HIV viral load 
of ≥ 50 copies/ml was associated with higher prevalence of HR-HPV infections. 
Whereas, CD4 T cells < 350/µl showed association with occurrence of multiple HPV 
infections. Time since HIV diagnosis seemed to impact HPV prevalence.
CONCLUSION: Pregnant WLWH require particularly attentive and extended HPV-, 
colposcopical- and cytological screening, whereby clinical and HIV-related risk 
factors should be taken into account."
230,"OBJECTIVES: Lymph node (LN) metastasis is a common cause of recurrence in oral 
cancer; however, the accuracy of distinguishing positive and negative LNs is not 
ideal. Here, we aimed to develop a deep learning model that can identify, 
locate, and distinguish LNs in contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) images with a higher 
accuracy.
METHODS: The preoperative CECT images and corresponding postoperative 
pathological diagnoses of 1466 patients with oral cancer from our hospital were 
retrospectively collected. In stage I, full-layer images (five common anatomical 
structures) were labeled; in stage II, negative and positive LNs were separately 
labeled. The stage I model was innovatively employed for stage II training to 
improve accuracy with the idea of transfer learning (TL). The Mask R-CNN 
instance segmentation framework was selected for model construction and 
training. The accuracy of the model was compared with that of human observers.
RESULTS: A total of 5412 images and 5601 images were labeled in stage I and II, 
respectively. The stage I model achieved an excellent segmentation effect in the 
test set (AP50-0.7249). The positive LN accuracy of the stage II TL model was 
similar to that of the radiologist and much higher than that of the surgeons and 
students (0.7042 vs. 0.7647 (p = 0.243), 0.4216 (p < 0.001), and 0.3629 (p < 
0.001)). The clinical accuracy of the model was highest (0.8509 vs. 0.8000, 
0.5500, 0.4500, and 0.6658 of the Radiology Department).
CONCLUSIONS: The model was constructed using a deep neural network and had high 
accuracy in LN localization and metastasis discrimination, which could 
contribute to accurate diagnosis and customized treatment planning.
KEY POINTS: • Lymph node metastasis is not well recognized with modern medical 
imaging tools. • Transfer learning can improve the accuracy of deep learning 
model prediction. • Deep learning can aid the accurate identification of lymph 
node metastasis."

232,"Relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is common and is 
associated with a dismal prognosis. Treatment options are limited and the 
understanding of molecular response patterns is still challenging. We analyzed 
the clonal response patterns of 15 patients with relapsed/refractory AML treated 
with selinexor in a phase II trial (SAIL). DNA was analyzed at three time points 
and showed a decline of mutated alleles in FLT3, SF3B1, and TP53 under SAIL 
treatment. Overall survival (OS) was similar between patients with declining 
versus persisting clones. We show an interesting long-term course of a patient 
who relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) with SF3B1- 
and SRSF2-mutated AML and received selinexor as maintenance treatment for 
4 years. Measurable residual disease (MRD) remained detectable for 2 weeks after 
donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) in this patient and then remained negative under 
selinexor maintenance treatment. Selinexor was tolerated well and was stopped 
after 4 years of SAIL treatment. We present an exploratory study and identify 
subclonal patterns of patients treated with selinexor."
233,"PURPOSE: The tumorigenesis of squamous cell cancer of unknown primary (SCCUP) in 
the head and neck area has not been decoded so far, while poor survival rates 
and limited therapeutic options pose a serious challenge. The aim of this 
project was to investigate immunological characteristics of SCCUPs and compare 
them to oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).
METHODS: PD-L1 expression (TC) was examined by immunohistochemistry in 50 lymph 
node metastases of SCCUP and 47 primaries of OPSCC. CD3 + and CD8 + lymphocytic 
infiltration was measured in 5 high power fields. Expression of p16 and HPV ISH 
were assessed.
RESULTS: SCCUP demonstrated a significantly higher expression of PD-L1 than 
OPSCC. In p16-negative SCCUPs PD-L1 proved to be an independent prognostic 
factor to prioritize high-risk patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Immunologic differences between SCCUP and OPSCC were detected. A 
higher PD-L1 expression in SCCUP could potentially facilitate further evaluation 
of checkpoint inhibitor therapy."
234,"BACKGROUND: To date, the optimal recommended specific neoadjuvant regimens for 
resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC or BRPC) remain an 
unanswered issue.
METHODS: We systematically searched the electronic databases to identify 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different neoadjuvant therapy 
strategies for RPC or BRPC. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). 
Comprehensive analyses and evaluations were performed using the single-arm, 
paired, and network meta-analyses.
RESULTS: Twelve RCTs involving 1279 patients with RPC or BRPC were enrolled. The 
paired meta-analysis showed that neoadjuvant therapy improved OS for both RPC 
(hazard ratio (HR) 0.69, 95% c.i. 0.54 to 0.87) and BRPC (HR 0.60, 0.42 to 0.86) 
compared with upfront surgery (UP-S). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) also 
improved OS for both RPC (HR 0.63, 0.47 to 0.85) and BRPC (HR 0.44, 0.27 to 
0.71), while neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACR) improved OS only for BRPC (HR 
0.68, 0.52 to 0.89) and not for RPC (HR 0.79, 0.54 to 1.16). Network 
meta-analysis found that NAC was superior to NACR in OS for RPC/BRPC (HR 0.58, 
0.37 to 0.90). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on modified fluorouracil/folinic 
acid/irinotecan/oxaliplatin (NAC-mFFX) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on 
abraxane/gemcitabine (NAC-AG) ranked first and second in OS for RPC/BRPC.
CONCLUSIONS: Both RPC and BRPC could obtain OS benefits from neoadjuvant therapy 
compared with UP-S, and NAC improved OS both in RPC and BRPC while NACR only 
improved OS in BRPC. Furthermore, NAC was superior to NACR, and NAC-mFFX and 
NAC-AG might be recommended sequentially as the best neoadjuvant therapy 
strategies."
235,"PURPOSE: To investigate the four-phase computed tomography (CT) features of 
rectal neuroendocrine neoplasms (R-NENs) as they relate to different World 
Health Organization pathological grades.
METHODS: A total of 42 patients who underwent pre-operative four-phase CT for 
evaluation of neoplasms confirmed as different pathological grades of R-NENs by 
surgery were included. The CT features were retrospectively analyzed by two 
radiologists in consensus including the tumor location, shape, long diameter, 
necrosis, boundary, transmural invasion, CT attenuation values of noncontrast 
and different enhancement phases, intra mesenteric metastasis, lateral lymph 
node metastasis, and distant metastasis. The differences among R-NENs of 
different pathological grades were analyzed using T-test, analysis of variance, 
and non-parametric rank sum test.
RESULTS: Among 42 cases (23 males, 19 females, aged 57 ± 10.48 years) of R-NENs, 
neuroendocrine tumors G1, G2, and G3 (NET G1, NET G2, NET G3) and neuroendocrine 
carcinoma (NEC) were 13, 13, 3 and 13 cases, respectively. There were 
statistically significant differences in tumor long diameter, shape, necrosis, 
boundary, transmural invasion, CT values in delayed phase, intra mesenteric 
metastasis, lateral lymph node metastasis, and liver metastasis of different 
pathological grades (P < 0.001, P = 0.014, P = 0.004, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, 
P = 0.038, P = 0.006, P = 0.022, and P = 0.020, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Features on four-phase CT can correlate with WHO pathological grades 
of R-NENs; this may be helpful for preoperative diagnosis and prognosis 
evaluation."
236,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic nonspecific intestinal inflammatory 
disease, which belongs to a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease, but still 
lacks effective drug treatment. Bletilla striata (B. striata) is one of the most 
valuable traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) in China, can stop bleeding, can 
promote wound healing, and can regulate immunity. Based on data mining, B. 
striata was found to be a common TCM for the treatment of UC, but the exact 
therapeutic mechanism is not yet known. This study aims to explore the potential 
mechanisms of B. striata in the treatment of UC using network pharmacology, 
molecular docking techniques, and in vivo experimental research. We extracted 
the active ingredients and targets of B. striata from the Traditional Chinese 
Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database and analysis platform. We 
retrieved and screened the corresponding UC-related target genes in multiple 
databases. Subsequently, we constructed an 
herb-ingredient-target-disease-network, generated a protein-protein interaction 
network, performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, and performed Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis to identify potential 
treatment mechanisms. After screening for key active ingredients and target 
genes, we performed molecular docking using AutoDock Vina software to select the 
best binding target for molecular docking and validate the binding activity. The 
UC model was established in mice, and the results of network pharmacology and 
molecular docking were verified by in vivo experiments. In all, 5 compounds were 
obtained from the TCMSP database, and 74 UC-related pathogenic genes were 
obtained from GeneCards, DisGeNET, OMIM, TTD, and DrugBank. After KEGG 
enrichment analysis, pathways in cancer, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3K)/AKT signalling pathway, and metabolic pathways were identified as the top 
three signalling pathways associated with UC treatment. The results of molecular 
docking showed that the active components of B. striata have good binding 
activities to the pivotal targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and 
PIK3CA. In a dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis model, we found that B. 
striata can alleviate the symptoms of UC, decrease the secretion of the 
inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α, and 
downregulate the expression levels of EGFR, PIK3CA, and p-AKT. In conclusion, 
the treatment of UC with B. striata may alleviate the inflammatory response of 
the colon, and B. striata mainly inhibits the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signalling pathways."
237,"Purpose: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic 
hepatic disease worldwide, with functional impairment of the mitochondria 
occurring from early stages. Technetium-99m methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile 
(99mTc-MIBI) is a lipophilic agent trapped in the mitochondria. This study aims 
to evaluate the utility of 99mTc-MIBI heart/liver uptake ratio in screening for 
NAFLD during myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). Methods: Seventy eligible 
patients underwent a 2-d rest/stress 99mTc-MIBI scan with a 2-min planar image 
acquired in rest phase, at 30, 60, and 120 min postradiotracer administration. 
Heart/liver uptake ratio was calculated by placing identical regions of interest 
on the heart and liver dome. All patients underwent liver ultrasound and were 
allocated into groups A, having NAFLD; and B, healthy individuals without NAFLD. 
Results: Mean count per pixel heart/liver ratios gradually increased over time 
in either group; nonetheless the values were significantly higher in group A, 
regardless of acquisition timing; with the p-value equal to 0.007, 0.014, and 
0.010 at 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively. Conclusion: Determining 99mTc-MIBI 
heart/liver uptake ratio during rest phase in patients undergoing MPI may be a 
useful, noninvasive screening method for NAFLD; with no additional cost, 
radiation burden, or adverse effects in these patients. Trial registration 
number: IR.SBMU.MSP.REC.1398.308."
238,"INTRODUCTION: Several techniques have been proposed for the closure of loop 
ileostomy. This is the first study comparing bowel function and outcomes of two 
different hand-sewn surgical techniques used for the closure of diverting 
protective loop ileostomy.
METHOD: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial, 40 
patients with a history of rectal cancer, low anterior resection, and diverting 
loop ileostomy who were candidates for ileostomy reversal were included and 
randomly assigned into two groups, hand-sewn direct repair of the ileal defect 
(group A) and resection and hand-sewn anastomosis of the ileum (group B).
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 56.42 and 52.10 years in groups A and B, 
respectively. Regarding early postoperative period, group A developed earlier 
first gas passage (1.68 vs. 2.25 days, p = 0.041) and stool passage (2.10 vs. 
2.80 days, p = 0.032). Group A also revealed shorter operating time (83.68 vs. 
89.50 min, p = 0.040) and hospital stay (4.73 vs. 6.80 days, p = 0.001). None of 
the participants in both groups developed signs of bowel obstruction during the 
early and late postoperative follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Direct hand-sewn repair for the closure of diverting loop ileostomy 
is a safe technique with better postoperative bowel function, oral diet 
tolerance, and less hospital stay compared to resection and hand-sewn 
anastomosis of the ileum."
239,"Together with an anti-tumor immune response, oncolysis using a recombinant viral 
vector promises to eliminate cancer cells by both gene transfer and 
host-mediated functions. In this study we explore oncolysis induced by 
nonreplicating adenoviral vectors used for p14ARF and interferon-β (hIFNβ) gene 
transfer in human melanoma cell lines, revealing an unexpected role for p14ARF 
in promoting cellular responses predictive of immune stimulation. Oncolysis was 
confirmed when UACC-62 (p53 wild-type) cells succumbed upon p14ARF gene transfer 
in vitro, whereas SK-Mel-29 (p53-mutant) benefitted from its combination with 
hIFNβ. In the case of UACC-62, in situ gene therapy in nude mice yielded reduced 
tumor progression in response to the p14ARF and hIFNβ combination. Potential for 
immune stimulation was revealed where p14ARF gene transfer in vitro was 
sufficient to induce emission of immunogenic cell death factors in UACC-62 and 
upregulate pro-immune genes, including IRF1, IRF7, IRF9, ISG15, TAP-1, and B2M. 
In SK-Mel-29, p14ARF gene transfer induced a subset of these factors. hIFNβ was, 
as expected, sufficient to induce these immune-stimulating genes in both cell 
lines. This work is a significant advancement for our melanoma gene therapy 
strategy because we revealed not only the induction of oncolysis, but also the 
potential contribution of p14ARF to immune stimulation."
240,"OBJECTIVE: Management of patients with penile cancer (PeC) with palpable 
inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs) relies on radical ILN dissection (RILND). Low burden 
of nodal metastatic disease may lead to long-lasting survival with surgical 
management. Nevertheless, RILND involves significant postoperative morbidity. We 
compared the complications of patients undergoing RILND with (RILND-T) and 
without (RILND-0T) placement of a collagen-fibrin sealant patch on the resection 
bed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an observational retrospective study. Data 
from men submitted to RILND-T and RILND-0T from Jan/2001 to Feb/2022, in a 
tertiary care centre were compared. The primary endpoint was the overall 
incidence of complications until 1 month after the procedure and their 
respective severity in both cohorts (Clavien-Dindo classification system). 
Secondarily, length of hospital stay (LOHS) was analysed. The placement of a 
collagen-fibrin sealant patch was left at the surgeon's discretion.
RESULTS: Seven patients underwent RILND-T and 20 underwent RILND-0T, 
respectively. There were no differences in pathologic TNM stage nor in the total 
number of ILNs removed (17 ± 4 vs. 20 ± 8, p = 0.37). Overall, 23 (85.2%) 
patients had complications. The complication rate was similar in both cohorts 
(85.7% vs 85%, p = 0.73). Surgical wound infection (3/7 vs. 11/20) and 
lymphocele (4/7 vs. 11/20) were the most reported complications. Patients 
undergoing RILND-T were discharged faster (mean length of hospital stay 9 ± 3 vs 
19 ± 20 days, p = 0.22).
CONCLUSIONS: The application of a collagen-fibrin sealant patch on the resection 
bed does not seem to reduce the postoperative complication rate in patients 
undergoing RILND. Nevertheless, a trend towards a shorter LOHS in patients with 
RILND-T cannot be excluded and should be validated by further studies with a 
higher number of patients."
241,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact on erectile and ejaculatory function following 
transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies of the prostate (TRUS-Bx) in sexually 
active men.
METHODS: Monocentric prospective study from May 2021 to January 2022 of 
consecutive patients with suspected prostate cancer [elevated prostate specific 
antigen (PSA) level and/or abnormal digital rectal examination] undergoing 
TRUS-Bx. The 15-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function 
(IIEF-15), Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PDET) and short form of Male 
Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ-EjD Short Form) were assessed before, one and 
three months after TRUS-Bx. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the risk of 
temporary post-biopsy erectile and/or ejaculatory dysfunctions. The statistical 
significance was set as p value < 0.05.
RESULTS: A total of 276 consecutive patients were included in the study. The 
median age, PSA and biopsy cores were 65 years (IQR 59-69), 7 ng/ml (IQR 5-9.7) 
and 16 (IQR 12-16), respectively. We compared the IIEF subdomains before TRUS-Bx 
vs. one or three months: the erectile function (EF) decreased after one month 
(p<0.001) but recovered after three months (p=0.833); the Orgasmic Function 
(OF), the Sexual Desire (SD), the Intercourse Satisfaction (IS), the Overall 
Satisfaction (OS), and Total IIEF decreased significantly after both one and 
three months compared to pre-biopsy values (p < 0.05). As for ejaculatory 
function (EjF), PDET, MSHQ-EjD Short Form 1, 2, 3 and MSHQ-EjD Short Form 4 
scores decreased significantly after one month (p < 0.001), but they returned to 
pre-biopsy values after 3 months: p = 0.538, p = 0.071 and p = 0.098, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study proved that EF, assessed through IIEF- 15, and 
ejaculatory function, assessed through PDET and MSHQ-EjD Short Form, were 
negatively affected by TRUS-Bx one month after the procedure and recovered after 
three months. Interestingly, the other IIEF-15 subdomains (OF, SD, IS, OS and 
Total) resulted as significantly reduced also after 3 months: this issue 
highlights the importance of carefully considering the indication to TRUS-Bx."
242,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of patients 
suffering prostate cancer (PCa) treated conservatively using 1064 nm laser 
energy for focal laser ablation (FLA). The patients included in the study were 
unsuitable for surgery or unwilling to receive external beam radiotherapy 
because they were afraid of the possible side effects of whole-gland therapies.
METHODS: This study included patients with a diagnosis of nonmetastatic PCa who 
underwent FLA using SoracteLiteTM system. Tissue ablation was performed at a 
fixed power of 5 W by the diode multichannel laser system EchoLaser X4 that uses 
laser light transmitted through optical fibres causing the target tissue to 
undergo irreversible thermal damage. Functional outcomes were evaluated with the 
International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) and 5-item version of the 
International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) before the treatment and one 
year later.
RESULTS: Ten patients suffering non-metastatic PCa were included. Four decided 
upon a conservative treatment because of reduced performance status and for six 
patients the procedure was chosen electively. All patients underwent 
multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging at 3 and 12 months and eight out of 
ten patients underwent prostate biopsy at 6 months. Persistent disease was 
detected in 3 patients who underwent a second ablation. In these patients at the 
biopsy following the second ablation none harbored residual disease. At 
follow-up, no patient suffered urinary incontinence requiring the use of pads. 
No significant worsening in sexual potency measured with IIEF-5 (p = 0.356) or 
prostatic symptoms measured at IPSS (p = 0.462) were recorded comparing 
pre-treatment condition vs one-year follow-up. Compared with baseline, 
prostate-specific antigen was significantly reduced at one-year follow-up (3.7 ± 
1.1 vs 7.9 ± 4.1 ng/mL; p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Although whole gland therapies remain the gold standard treatment 
for PCa, our results indicate that the SoracteLiteTM system for focal laser 
ablation, as a very preliminary step, appears to offer a short-term oncologic 
control of PCa with negligible side effects."
243,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated AB0 blood groups prevalence according to 
preoperative and pathological tumor characteristics, and their association with 
oncological outcomes, and renal function decline in a contemporary large cohort 
of bladder cancer (BCa) patients, who underwent radical cystectomy (RC) at a 
tertiary referral center.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated data of patients with 
histologically confirmed and clinically non metastatic BCa, who underwent RC 
between 2014 and 2021 at our Institution. Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots and Cox 
regression (CR) models tested the relationship between AB0 blood groups and 
local recurrence-, metastasis-, cancer specific mortality-, and overall 
mortality-free survival. Logistic regression (LR) models tested the association 
between AB0 blood groups and renal function decline, defined as an estimated 
Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min, at post-operative day 1, 
discharge and 6- months of follow-up.
RESULTS: Of 301 included patients, 128 (42.5%) had group A, 126 (41.9%) had 
group 0, 28 (9.3%) had group B, and 19 (6.3%) had group AB. Patients with group 
0 developed higher rates of muscle- invasive BCa (p = 0.028) with high-grade 
features (p = 0.005) at last bladder resection, and less frequently received 
preoperative immunotherapy with Bacillus of Calmette-Guerin (p = 0.044), than 
their non-0 counterparts. Additionally, these patients harbored more advanced 
pathologic tumor stage at RC (p = 0.024). KM plots showed no differences among 
all tested cancer control outcomes between AB0 blood groups (p > 0.05 in all 
cases). Patients with group AB presented the lowest median eGFR at each time 
point. In multivariable LR analyses addressing renal function decline, group AB 
was independently associated with eGFR< 60 mL/min at discharge (Odds Ratio: 
4.28, p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: Among AB0 blood groups, patients with group 0 exhibited the most 
aggressive tumor profile. However, no differences were recorded in recurrence or 
survival rates. Group AB independently predicted renal function decline at 
discharge."
244,"OBJECTIVES: Phosphate and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) acts as a regulator of 
PI3-KAkt molecular pathway. ETS Related gene (ERG), an oncogene located in 
chromosome 21q22.2, is involved in prostate cancer (PCa) by serine 2 (TMPRSS2), 
a protein encoded by TMPRSS2 gene. The aim of this study is to evaluate the 
clinical impact of PTEN loss and ERG rearrangement in terms of oncologic results 
in patients diagnosed with localized PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective data were collected from a total of 74 
patients who underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy for localized PCa 
and immunohistochemical study was performed in tissue samples. The primary 
antibodies for anti-ERG antibody as well as anti-PTEN antibody were obtained 
from DAKO. ERG was considered positive if at least 20% of the evaluated cells 
were stained at least with medium intensity. PTEN protein loss was considered 
when the intensity of cytoplasmic and nuclear staining was mild or entirely 
negative across > 10% of tumor cells.
RESULTS: Homogenous loss of PTEN was associated with higher clinical 
International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade (p = 0.018) while no 
statistical significant association was present regarding the presence of ERG 
rearrangement with either ISUPc or ISUPp. After a median follow up of 34 months, 
24 patients developed biochemical recurrence. No statistical significant 
correlation of ERG status with biochemical recurrence was noted while PTEN was 
associated with biochemical recurrence development in a statistical significant 
way. Lastly the combination of PTEN loss with ERG rearrangement presence was 
detected more often in higher ISUPc and ISUPp as well as biochemical recurrence 
development, although in a non statistical significant way.
CONCLUSIONS: Homogenous and heterogenous PTEN loss was associated with 
biochemical recurrence. No association of ERG and biochemical recurrence was 
noted. The combination of PTEN loss and ERG rearrangement presented a trend for 
higher ISUPc and ISUPp as well as biochemical recurrence but not in a 
statistical significant way."
245,"OBJECTIVE: Bladder cancer (BC) is considered one of the malignancies with 
moderate-high incidence, high rate of recurrence and costly management. 
Diagnosis and staging are thus important for therapeutic purposes. Considering 
the risk of residual tumour and understaging, in specific cases, international 
guidelines recommend performing a second transurethral resection of the bladder 
(reTURB). Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of hexaminolevulinate 
Photodynamic Diagnostics (PDD) at first TURB on the rate of residual tumour.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed patients undergoing TURB in 
our centre between 2012 and 2020. Eightytwo patients had a re-TURB after a first 
complete TURB with a delay < 3 months. Patients who had an incomplete first 
resection were excluded. We compared patients who underwent standard white light 
cystoscopy/TURB and then hexaminolevulinate PDDguided reTURB (group A, n = 49) 
and patients with PDD-cystoscopy/ TURB at the first procedure then white light 
cystoscopy/reTURB (group B, n = 33). The residual tumour rate at reTURB as well 
as median recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Residual tumour at reTURB was detected in 48.8% of cases in our cohort, 
with a significant difference between the two groups (71.4% in group A versus 
12.5% in group B, p < 0.001). After a median follow-up of 22 months, the median 
RFS was 15 months in Group A and 32 months in Group B, but this difference was 
not significant (p = 0.7).
CONCLUSIONS: Using PDD at the time of the initial TURB had a statistically 
significant impact on the rate of residual tumour at the reTURB. Nevertheless, 
the percentage of residual tumour even with the use of PDD does not allow for 
safely omitting second resection. Performing a reTURB with PDD for patients who 
did not have it initially, provides the same benefit in terms of recurrence-free 
survival."
246,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine if patients undergoing radical 
retropubic prostatectomy with localized prostate cancer under combined 
(epidural-spinal) anaesthesia have any benefit over patients undergoing the 
procedure under general anaesthesia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with clinically localised prostate cancer, 
scheduled for radical retropubic prostatectomy, were allocated to undergo the 
operation under either general anaesthesia (GA) or under combined 
(epidural-spinal) (CESA) anaesthesia. Several parameters were recorded both 
preoperatively (medical history, biometric data, PSA, biopsy Gleason score) and 
postoperatively (blood pressure, heart rate, haemoglobin levels, operation time 
and total hospital stay). In addition, mean arterial pressure, change in heart 
rate, total blood loss, blood transfusions, SAS score, intravenous fluid 
administration and operation time were also noted down intraoperatively. Patient 
pain levels and total satisfaction were evaluated using appropriate 
questionnaires. At the 12-month follow-up, biochemical recurrence using PSA 
levels and urinary continence status were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included (30 in each group). 
Intraoperatively, mean MAP and heart rate change was higher in the GA group 
(MAP+7,46, HR+27) and mean SAS was higher in the CESA group (+0.93). The time 
needed for patients' recovery was faster (-3.5 min) and hospitalization was 
shorter for patients in the CESA group (-0.6 days). Intraoperative blood loss, 
time for induction and duration of operation were not significantly different. 
Mean postoperative drop of haemoglobin was greater in the GA group (+0.56) while 
blood transfusions, VAS pain scores and amount of intravenous fluids did not 
differ significantly between the two groups. No complications were reported. 
Patient satisfaction and urinary continence were comparable between the groups 
and there were no cases of biochemical recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Radical retropubic prostatectomy can safely be performed under 
combined (spinal epidural anaesthesia, with possible benefits of lower blood 
loss, less post-operative complications and earlier discharge. Both procedures 
have equal oncological and functional outcomes at the 12-month follow-up."
247,"OBJECTIVES: Focal therapies (FTs) are promising techniques for the treatment of 
localized prostate cancer. We assessed the medium-term oncological outcomes of 
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) treated with HIFU or cryotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred and fifty consecutive patients with 
intermediate-risk PCa, treated between 2009 and 2018 at a single center were 
included. Primary study outcome was failure-free survival (FFS), defined as 
absence of additional treatment, systemic progression or prostate cancer related 
death.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven (25%) patients underwent cryotherapy and 113 (75%) HIFU. 
Median age was 69 (IQR 62-72) years, with 36 (24%) presenting palpable disease 
on rectal examination, and median total PSA of 7.85 (IQR 5.75-10.62) ng/mL. 
Patients were followed for a median of 61 (IQR 48-82) months. FFS at 2 and 4 
years was of 75.6% and 53.6%, respectively. Survival from whole gland or 
systematic treatment at 2 and 4 years was of 78.9% and 53.9%, respectively. 
Patients with FFS presented lower total PSA nadir (1.89 vs 3.25 ng/mL, p < 
0.001), higher % PSA reduction at 3 months (66.1% vs 49.3%, p < 0.001), and at 
nadir (75.5% vs 55.8%, p < 0.001). Other characteristics such has the treatment 
modality, age, prostate size, initial total PSA, cT stage, International Society 
of Urological Pathology (ISUP), tumor location and biopsy results by region did 
not differ between patients failing and not failing FT. Complications were 
uncommon (13%), with only onr (1%) patient having Clavien-Dindo grade > II. No 
deaths due to treatment were registered.
CONCLUSIONS: At medium-term, FTs for intermediate-risk PCa presented good 
oncological results, with an excellent safety profile."
248,"OBJECTIVES: Localized very high-risk prostate cancer (VHR PCa) has long suffered 
from the inex-istence of good lymph node staging methods other than invasive 
surgery, as computed tomogra-phy has low sensitivity for nodal disease. With the 
rising use of positron emission tomography (PET), it is clinically meaningful to 
know its value for these patients. Our goal was to evaluate the real-life 
diagnostic accuracy of PET Choline in nodal staging, comparing it with the gold 
standard of extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed data from a high-volume center, including 
patients with VHR PCa according to current NCCN guidelines who underwent 
community 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT; followed by ro-botic assisted laparoscopic 
prostatectomy (RALP) and ePLND between 2010 and 2021.
RESULTS: We included 44 patients and 88 lymph node regions. Among those, 14/44 
(31.8%) patients and 20/88 (22.7%) regions had nodal disease present on 
definitive pathology. In comparison with ePLND, we found a sensitivity of 64.3% 
(95% CI, 39.2-89.4%), specificity of 83.3% (95% CI, 70.0- 96.7%), PPV of 64.3% 
(95% CI, 39.2-89.4%), and NPV of 83.3% (95% CI, 70.0-96.7%) for nodal disease on 
a patient-based analysis; and sensitivity of 35.0% (95% CI, 14.1-60.0%), 
specificity of 88.2% (95% CI, 80.6-95.9%), PPV of 46.7% (95% CI, 21.4-71.9%), 
and NPV of 82.2% (95% CI, 73.4-91.0%) on a region-based analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In our view 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT doesn't meet the criteria to 
be a standard exam for pre-operative staging for patients with VHR PCa, mostly 
due to its low sensitivity. However, other radiotracers should continue to be 
investigated in this setting."
249,"BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy with a 2 per 100 000 
incidence rate in the world. Overall survival (OS) of patients in stage I-II 
disease is around 80%, whereas OS of patients in stage III-IVB disease drops to 
60%, implying the importance of diagnosis to reduce NPC mortality. However, more 
than 70% patients of NPC were diagnosed at advanced stages (stage III and IV) in 
clinics, and it definitely contributes to little substantial improvement in the 
5-year survival rates although NPC is sensitive to radio-and chemotherapy. 
Hence, development of novel biomarkers and targetable genes in NPC is eagerly 
awaited.
METHODS: We had analyzed the dataset GSE12452 and found hundreds of genes 
trans-activated in NPC. Among them, this study focused on PARP-1 binding protein 
(PARPBP) whose overexpression was also validated in GSE13597 and GSE53819 
datasets.
RESULTS: Knockdown of PARPBP significantly reduced cell viability in NPC and 
also identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes including 377 
downregulated and 518 upregulated genes in HONE-1 cells with stably knockdown 
PARPBP. Furthermore, PARPBP might promote cell migration and invasion in NPC 
through positive regulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2C (UBE2C).
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the aberrant expression of PARPBP in NPC, 
and imply its importance in nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis which further opens up 
the possibility of PARPBP as a novel diagnostic biomarker for NPC therapy."
250,"Cancer multidrug resistance (MDR) is an important reason that results in 
chemotherapy failure. As a main mechanism of MDR, overexpressed P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp) utilizes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to actively pump chemotherapy drugs 
out of cells. In addition, metabolic reprogramming of drug-resistant tumor cells 
(DRTCs) exacerbates the specific hypoxic microenvironment and promotes tumor 
metastasis and recurrence. Therefore, we propose a novel sonodynamic therapy 
(SDT) paradigm to induce energy metabolism disorder and drug resistance change 
of DRTCs. A US-controlled ""Nanoenabled Energy Metabolism Jammer"" (TL@HPN) is 
designed using perfluoropentane (PFP) adsorbing oxygen in the core, and a 
targeting peptide (CGNKRTR) is attached to the liposome as the delivery carrier 
shell to incorporate hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) and paclitaxel 
(PTX). The TL@HPN with ultrasonic/photoacoustic imaging (PAI/USI) precisely 
controlled the release of drugs and oxygen after being triggered by ultrasound 
(US), which attenuated the hypoxic microenvironment. SDT boosted the reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) content in tumor tissues, preferentially inducing 
mitochondrial apoptosis and maximizing immunogenic cell death (ICD). 
Persistently elevated oxidative stress levels inhibited ATP production and 
downregulated P-gp expression by disrupting the redox balance and electron 
transfer of the respiratory chain. We varied the effect of TL@HPN combined with 
PD-1/PD-L1 to activate autoimmunity and inhibit tumor metastasis, providing a 
practical strategy for expanding the use of SDT-mediated tumor energy 
metabolism."
251,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous and complex disease with limited 
treatment options. Targeting transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and programmed 
death ligand 1 pathways may enhance antitumor efficacy. Bintrafusp alfa is a 
first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein composed of the extracellular domain 
of TGF-β receptor II (a TGF-β ""trap"") fused to a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody 
blocking programmed cell death ligand 1. We report results from an expansion 
cohort of a phase I study (NCT02517398) in patients with heavily pretreated 
advanced CRC treated with bintrafusp alfa. As of May 15, 2020, 32 patients with 
advanced CRC had received bintrafusp alfa for a median duration of 7.1 weeks. 
The objective response rate was 3.1% and the disease control rate was 6.3% (1 
partial response, 1 stable disease); 2 patients were not evaluable. The safety 
profile was consistent with previously reported data."
252,"BACKGROUND: In phase III TIVO-3 trial, tivozanib improved progression-free 
survival (PFS) compared to sorafenib for patients with metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma (mRCC). However, the effectiveness of this drug after exposure to 
other selective VEGFR agents has not yet been defined. Herein, we characterize 
the clinical efficacy of tivozanib in patients with mRCC previously treated with 
axitinib.
METHODS: We identified patients from the intention to treat (ITT) population, in 
the TIVO-3 trial, who received treatment with axitinib before enrolment in the 
study and evaluated PFS, response rate (RR), and safety.
RESULTS: Out of 350 patients, 172 (83:89, tivozanib:sorafenib) had received 
prior treatment with axitinib in TIVO-3. In this subgroup, PFS was 5.5 months 
with tivozanib and 3.7 months with sorafenib (HR 0.68). RR was 13% and 8% 
favoring tivozanib.
CONCLUSIONS: Tivozanib is active in the treatment of patients with mRCC who have 
progressed on prior therapies, including axitinib."
253,"BACKGROUND: Geometrical uncertainties in patients can severely affect the 
quality of radiotherapy.
PURPOSE: We evaluated the dosimetric efficacy of robust optimization for helical 
intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning in the presence of patient 
setup uncertainty and anatomical changes.
METHODS: Two helical IMRT plans for 10 patients with localized prostate cancer 
were created using either minimax robust optimization (robust plan) or a 
conventional planning target volume (PTV) margin approach (PTV plan). Plan 
robustness was evaluated by creating perturbed dose plans with setup uncertainty 
from isocenter shifts and anatomical changes due to organ variation. The 
magnitudes of the geometrical uncertainties were based on the patient setup 
uncertainty considered during robust optimization, which was identical to the 
PTV margin. The homogeneity index, and target coverage (TC, defined as the V100% 
of the clinical target volume), and organs at risk (OAR; rectum and bladder) 
doses were analyzed for all nominal and perturbed plans. A statistical t-test 
was performed to evaluate the differences between the robust and PTV plans.
RESULTS: Comparison of the nominal plans showed that the robust plans had lower 
OAR doses and a worse homogeneity index and TC than the PTV plans. The 
evaluations of robustness that considered setup errors more than the PTV margin 
demonstrated that the worst-case perturbed scenarios for robust plans had 
significantly higher TC while maintaining lower OAR doses. However, when 
anatomical changes were considered, improvement in TC from robust optimization 
was not observed in the worst-case perturbed plans.
CONCLUSIONS: For helical IMRT planning in localized prostate cancer, robust 
optimization provides benefits over PTV margin-based planning, including better 
OAR sparing, and increased robustness against systematic patient-setup errors."
254,"Objective: In this study, we aimed to determine the role of Psidium cattleianum 
extract (PCE) and compare its effects with those of metformin (Met) in an animal 
model with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Methods: T2DM was induced in rats 
using a high-fat diet (HFD), followed by a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ). 
Met and PCE were administered intragastrically once a day throughout the 
experiment, and their effects on biochemical, inflammatory, oxidative, and 
histological parameters were evaluated.Results: Met and PCE prevented the 
increase in serum levels of glucose, total cholesterol (TC), triacylglycerol 
(TG), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced by 
T2DM, and restored redox homeostasis in the liver and brain. Met increased the 
serum levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine and interleukin-10 (IL-10). 
Furthermore, both treatments restored the liver and pancreas from marked 
cellular disorganization, vacuolization, and necrosis, with PCE being more 
effective than Met in recovering histological changes.Conclusion: PCE is a 
promising agent for the prevention of T2DM complications."
255,"Systematic identification of signaling pathways required for the fitness of 
cancer cells will facilitate the development of new cancer therapies. We used 
gene essentiality measurements in 1,086 cancer cell lines to identify selective 
co-essentiality modules and found that a ubiquitin ligase complex composed of 
UBA6, BIRC6, KCMF1 and UBR4, which is required for the survival of a subset of 
epithelial tumors that exhibit a high degree of aneuploidy. Suppressing BIRC6 in 
cell lines that are dependent on this complex led to a substantial reduction in 
cell fitness in vitro and potent tumor regression in vivo. Mechanistically, 
BIRC6 suppression resulted in selective activation of the integrated stress 
response (ISR) by stabilization of the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), a direct 
ubiquitination target of the UBA6/BIRC6/KCMF1/UBR4 complex. These observations 
uncover a novel ubiquitination cascade that regulates ISR and highlight the 
potential of ISR activation as a new therapeutic strategy."
256,"BACKGROUND: It is known that the microenvironmental cytokine IFN-γ provides a 
survival advantage for CLL cells. However, the mechanisms involved in this 
effect have not been properly investigated.
METHODS: Herein, we conducted a comprehensive screening of the effects of IFN-γ 
on signaling pathways and gene expression profile in CLL cells by using western 
blotting, RT-qPCR and high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).
RESULTS: We found that IFN-γ not only activated the pro-survival STAT3, but also 
activated the AKT and ERK signaling pathways. RNA-seq analysis showed that IFN-γ 
stimulation changed the expression profiles of more than 500 genes, with 391 
being up-regulated and 123 down-regulated. These genes are involved in numerous 
biological processes, including anti-apoptosis, cell migration and 
proliferation. IFN-γ significantly up-regulated the expression of CD38, BCL6, 
CXCL9, BCL2A1, SCOS3, IL-10, HGF, EGFR, THBS-1, FN1 and MUC1, which encode 
proteins potentially associated with disease progression, worse prognosis or 
poor response to treatment. Blocking JAK1/2 or STAT3 signal by specific 
inhibitors affected the expression of most genes, suggesting a pivotal role of 
the JAK1/2-STAT3 pathway in IFN-γ pro-survival effects in CLL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrates that IFN-γ regulates a complex pro-survival 
signal network in CLL through JAK1/2-STAT3, which provides a rational 
explanation for IFN-γ promoting CLL cells survival and drug resistance. This

257,"PARP7, a polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase, has been identified as a 
negative regulator in type I interferon (IFN) signaling. An overexpression of 
PARP7 is typically found in a wide range of cancers and can lead to the 
suppression of type I IFN signaling and innate immune response. Herein, we 
describe the discovery of compound I-1, a novel PARP7 inhibitor with high 
inhibitory potency (IC50 = 7.6 nM) and selectivity for PARP7 over other PARPs. 
Especially, I-1 has excellent pharmacokinetic properties and low toxicity in 
mice and exhibits significantly stronger in vivo antitumor potency (TGI: 67%) 
than RBN-2397 (TGI: 30%) without the addition of 1-aminobenzotriazole (a 
nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of cytochrome P450) in CT26 syngeneic 
mouse models. Our findings reveal that I-1 mainly acts as an immune activator 
through PARP7 inhibition in the tumor microenvironment, which highlights the 
potential advantages of I-1 as a tumor immunotherapeutic agent."
258,"Increasing female age is accompanied by a corresponding fall in her fertility. 
This decline is influenced by a variety of factors over an individual's life 
course including background genetics, local environment and diet. Studying both 
coding and non-coding RNAs of the embryo could aid our understanding of the 
causes and/or effects of the physiological processes accompanying the decline 
including the differential expression of sub-cellular biomarkers indicative of 
various diseases. The current study is a post-hoc analysis of the expression of 
trophectoderm RNA data derived from a previous high throughput study. Its main 
aim is to determine the characteristics and potential functionalities that 
characterize long non-coding RNAs. As reported previously, a maternal 
age-related component is potentially implicated in implantation success. 
Trophectoderm samples representing the full range of maternal reproductive ages 
were considered in relation to embryonic implantation potential, trophectoderm 
transcriptome dynamics and reproductive maternal age. The long non-coding RNA 
(lncRNA) biomarkers identified here are consistent with the activities of 
embryo-endometrial crosstalk, developmental competency and implantation and 
share common characteristics with markers of neoplasia/cancer invasion. 
Corresponding genes for expressed lncRNAs were more active in the blastocysts of 
younger women are associated with metabolic pathways including cholesterol 
biosynthesis and steroidogenesis."
259,"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can progress over time and cause renal 
replacement therapy. Studies showed an association between metabolic syndrome 
(MetS) and CKD. Current evidence is from cross sectional studies. There is a 
need for robust data from big prospective cohort studies with long-term 
follow-up. This study investigated the association between CKD and MetS after 
18 years of follow-up.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Among 15,255 participants aged ≥20 years at baseline 
(1999-2005), after exclusion of CKD, cancer, use of corticosteroid, 8987 
participants entered the study and followed at a three-year cycle up to 2018. 
All participants were divided into five subgroups: (1) MetS free, (2) MetS+ 
(DM+, HTN-) (3) MetS+ (DM-, HTN+) (4) MetS+ (DM+, HTN+) (5) MetS+ (DM-, HTN-).
RESULT: At baseline the mean age of the participants was 39.8±13.3 y; 4996 
(55.6%) were females. CKD was developed in 2,038 (22.7 %) subjects during 
18 years of follow-up, of whom 1,107 had Mets. After adjusting for the 
confounding variables, MetS (DM+, HTN+) subgroup had the highest risk of CKD 
(HR=1.51, 95 % CI=1.32-1.71). MetS subjects with five components had higher 
incidence rate of CKD (HR=1.43, 95% CI= 1.22-1.68). There was no association 
between high waist circumference (WC) (HR=1.08, 95% CI=0.99-1.19) and 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (HR=1.07, 95% CI=0.98-1.18) with CKD.
CONCLUSION: CKD significantly develops in patients with MetS. Metabolic syndrome 
was associated with chronic kidney disease incidence at long term follow-up. 
Hypertension, diabetes and age were strong indicators, while abdominal obesity 
and reduced HDL were not associated with the incidence of CKD."
260,"While brown fat is strongly associated with a constellation of cardiometabolic 
benefits in animal models and humans, it has also been tied to cancer cachexia. 
In humans, cancer-associated cachexia increases mortality, raising the 
possibility that brown fat in this context may be associated with increased 
cancer death. However, the effect of brown fat on cancer-associated cachexia and 
survival in humans remains unclear. Here, we retrospectively identify patients 
with and without brown fat on fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron-emission 
tomography (PET) scans obtained as part of routine cancer care and assemble a 
cohort to address these questions. We did not find an association between brown 
fat status and cachexia. Furthermore, we did not observe an association between 
brown fat and increased mortality in patients with cachexia. Our analyses 
controlled for confounding factors including age at cancer diagnosis, sex, body 
mass index, cancer site, cancer stage, outdoor temperature, comorbid conditions 
(heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, cerebrovascular disease), and beta-blocker use. Taken together, 
our results suggest that brown fat is not linked to cancer-associated cachexia 
and does not worsen overall survival in patients with cachexia."
261,"Mutations in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
can be drivers of cancer and also trigger drug resistance in patients receiving 
chemotherapy treatment based on kinase inhibitors. A priori knowledge of the 
impact of EGFR variants on drug sensitivity would help to optimize chemotherapy 
and design new drugs that are effective against resistant variants before they 
emerge in clinical trials. To this end, we explored a variety of in silico 
methods, from sequence-based to ""state-of-the-art"" atomistic simulations. We did 
not find any sequence signal that can provide clues on when a drug-related 
mutation appears or the impact of such mutations on drug activity. Low-level 
simulation methods provide limited qualitative information on regions where 
mutations are likely to cause alterations in drug activity, and they can predict 
around 70% of the impact of mutations on drug efficiency. High-level simulations 
based on nonequilibrium alchemical free energy calculations show predictive 
power. The integration of these ""state-of-the-art"" methods into a workflow 
implementing an interface for parallel distribution of the calculations allows 
its automatic and high-throughput use, even for researchers with moderate 
experience in molecular simulations."
262,"The critical challenge for cancer vaccine-induced T-cell immunity is the 
sustained activation of antigen cross-presentation in antigen-presenting cells 
(APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, we first discover that the 
clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), 
markedly augment the type-I interferon (IFN-I) production profile of the STING 
agonist MSA-2, and achieve a 16-fold dosage-sparing effect in the human STING 
haplotype. We next co-assembled acid-ionizable copolymers with IONPs and MSA-2 
into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph 
nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model 
antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen 
cross-presentation to elicit a 55-fold greater frequency of antigen-specific 
CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine 
immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung 
metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is 
applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune 
checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and 
distant metastasis in B16-OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The 
acid-ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable 
strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross-presentation for 
personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy. This article is protected by

263,"CD137 (4-1BB) is a costimulatory receptor of T and natural killer lymphocytes 
whose activity can be exploited in cancer immunotherapy strategies as discovered 
25 years ago. Following initial attempts that met unacceptable toxicity, new 
waves of constructs acting agonistically on CD137 are being developed in 
patients, offering signs of clinical and pharmacodynamic activity with tolerable 
safety profiles."
264,"Nucleic acid detection is undoubtedly one of the most important research fields 
to meet the medical needs of genetic disease diagnosis, cancer treatment, and 
infectious disease prevention. However, the practical detection methods based on 
biological amplification are complex and time-consuming and require highly 
trained operators. Herein, we report a simple, rapid, and sensitive method for 
the nucleic acid assay by fluorescence or naked eye using chemical cyclic 
amplification. The addition of hydroxylamine (HA) during the Fenton reaction can 
continuously generate hydroxyl radicals (•OH) via Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle, termed as 
""hydroxylamine boosts the Fenton reaction (Fenton-HA system)"". Meanwhile, the 
reducing substances, such as terephthalic acid or o-phenylenediamine, react with 
•OH to generate oxidized substances that can be recognized by the naked eye or 
detected by fluorescence so as to realize the detection of Fe3+. The 
concentration of Fe3+ has a good linear relationship with fluorescence intensity 
in the range of 0.1 to 100 nM, and the limit of detection is calculated to be 
0.03 nM (S/N = 3). Subsequently, Fe was introduced into the nucleic acid 
hybridization system after the Fe source was transformed into Fe3+, and the 
nucleic acids were indirectly determined by this method. This Fenton-HA system 
was used for sensing HIV-DNA and miRNA-21 to verify the validity of this method 
in nucleic acid detection. The detection limits were as low as 2.5 pM for 
HIV-DNA and 3 pM for miRNA-21. We believe that our work has unlocked an 
efficient signal amplification strategy, which is expected to develop a new 
generation of highly sensitive chemical biosensors."
265,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is emerging scientific evidence of the health 
benefits of traditional food plants at both molecular and folk remedy levels; 
however, epidemiological observations are limited. The Amami island region of 
Japan has a variety of unique traditions conserved till today, where a cohort 
study was conducted in 2005. The objective of this study was to investigate the 
associations between the intake of common and local vegetables and the risk of 
mortality and cancer incidence in Amami.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Participants were enrolled from the general population 
of Amami as part of the Japan Multi-institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) 
Study. In total, 5,015 participants (2,053 men and 2,962 women) aged 35-69 years 
were enrolled in this study. They were followed up to obtain information on 
movement, death, and cancer incidence. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were 
estimated using the Cox proportional hazard model after adjusting for potential 
confounding factors.
RESULTS: A significant inverse association was observed between cabbage intake 
and the HRs for overall mortality (p for trend=0.046) and lung cancer incidence 
(p=0.016). Intake of handama and togan as local vegetables was associated with 
decreased HRs for overall mortality (p=0.019 and 0.036, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: While the molecular and biochemical reasoning and residual 
confounding factors behind this association remain unclear, the findings of this 
study suggest that the dietary lifestyle in Amami has a positive impact on the 
residents, which can significantly decrease mortality risk."
266,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate independent risk 
factors for intra-abdominal infection and to construct a nomogram to identify 
colorectal patients at a high risk of intra-abdominal infection.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Clinical data of patients undergoing radical resection 
of colorectal cancer from January 2019 to December 2021 were retrospectively 
included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups according to 
postoperative intra-abdominal infection. Clinicopathological indicators, 
intraoperative conditions, and postoperative complications were compared between 
the two groups, logistic regression was used to look for independent risk 
factors for intra-abdominal infection, and a nomogram was constructed based on 
independent risk factors.
RESULTS: 402 colorectal cancer patients were enrolled in this study, and 46 
patients (11.4%) developed intra- abdominal infections after surgery. The 
independent risk factors for intra-abdominal infection were preoperative 
albumin, lymphocyte-white cell ratio (LWR) <0.17, low subcutaneous fat mass, and 
low skeletal muscle mass. The nomogram model for intra-abdominal infection was 
able to reliably quantify the risk of intraabdominal infection with strong 
optimism-adjusted discrimination (concordance index=0.931). Furthermore, 
decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram was clinically useful and had a 
better discriminative ability to recognize patients at high risk than the risk 
factors alone.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found that preoperative albumin, LWR <0.17, low 
subcutaneous fat mass, and low skeletal muscle mass were significantly 
correlated with intra-abdominal infection. Our nomogram was a simple and 
practical instrument to quantify the individual risk of intra-abdominal 
infection."
267,"The Immunotherapy of Cancer conference (ITOC) is an European meeting providing a 
global platform for discussions where all those dedicated to the immunotherapy 
of cancer can exchange their knowledge and the latest findings about 
immuno-oncology. The 9th ITOC was held in Munich in September 2022. Major 
highlights of the 2022 edition included the key note address and life time 
achievement to Laurence Zitvogel on her contributions on the understanding of 
the role of microbiota in cancer development and therapy resistance. Her 
research has paved the way for therapeutic exploitation of the microbiome."
268,"Antisaccade and prosaccade (PS) performance were studied in a large cohort of 
females (age range, 42-74). Antisaccade performance was assessed in two variants 
of the task, a ""traditional"" antisaccade (TA) task, in which no visual stimuli 
were present at the saccade goal, and a visually guided antisaccade (VGA) task, 
in which small visual stimuli were present at the possible saccade goals prior 
to the imperative visual stimulus. Directional error frequency was similar in 
the two antisaccade tasks. However, reaction time (RT) was ~33 msec longer in 
the VGA task than in the TA task. Across participants, average saccade amplitude 
of prosaccades and TAs were both correlated with those of VGAs, but not with 
each other. TAs had a hypermetria that increased with age. Saccade amplitude 
variability was much higher for TAs than for PSs and VGAs. Saccade polar angle 
variability was low for all 3 tasks. Age diminished performance with modest task 
dependence, except for an increase in TA hypermetria. These results suggest that 
the generation of antisaccade directional errors does not depend on visual 
target presence at the saccade goal, that antisaccade RT can be affected by 
target presence, that age can increase saccade hypermetria in the absence of 
visual guidance, and that visually guided antisaccades are governed by distinct 
voluntary and visually guided saccade mechanisms. Moreover, these results 
suggest that an understanding of human motor performance benefits from the use 
of a participant pool with a larger age range than is used in most studies."
269,"In order to provide a clinical reference for endometrial cancer treatment, this 
retrospective cohort study aimed to assess and compare the survival of 
endometrial cancer patients undergoing hysterectomy versus lymphadenectomy and 
hysterectomy combined with lymphadenectomy. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and 
End Results (SEER) database provided data on patients with primary endometrial 
cancer enrolled between 1975 and 2016. The longest follow-up time was ten years, 
and the median follow-up time was 51.00 months. The outcomes were overall 
survival (OS) and cancer-specificsurvival (CSS). COX models were constructed to 
assess the relationship between the three surgical methods and OS or CSS. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted based on American Joint Committee on Cancer 
(AJCC) stage and menopausal status. Totally 134,597 patients were included. In 
stage IV, the lymphadenectomy group had significantly worse OS than the 
hysterectomy group (HR = 1.330, 95%CI = 1.101-1.606). The hysterectomy combined 
with lymphadenectomy group had similar OS to the hysterectomy group (HR = 1.183, 
95%CI = 0.996-1.405). Regarding CSS, no significant differences were found 
between the hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy groups (HR = 1.267, 
95%CI = 0.996-1.610), and between the hysterectomy and hysterectomy combined 
with lymphadenectomy groups (HR = 1.186, 95%CI = 0.953-1.476) in stage IV. For 
postmenopausal women, lymphadenectomy (HR = 1.655, 95%CI = 1.495-1.831) and 
hysterectomy combined with lymphadenectomy (HR = 1.129, 95%CI = 1.038-1.228) 
were associated with significantly decreased OSthan hysterectomy. For CSS among 
postmenopausal women, significant declines inCSS were found in the 
lymphadenectomy (HR = 2.264, 95%CI = 1.957-2.619) and hysterectomy combined with 
lymphadenectomy (HR = 1.419, 95%CI = 1.260-1.599) groups versus the hysterectomy 
group. Hysterectomy may serve as a decision-making reference for clinicians in 
treating patients in stage IV or after menopause, combined with clinical 
experience and patients' wishes."
270,"To evaluate the clinical features, molecular subtypes, therapeutic strategies, 
and prognostic factors of occult breast cancer (OBC). Patients with T0-3/N1-3/M0 
breast cancer diagnosed in 2010-2018 (n = 114,303, including 691 with OBC) were 
retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results (SEER) database. 
The endpoints were overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival 
(BCSS). Compared with non-OBC, OBC presented significantly more adverse 
clinicopathological prognostic features. More patients with OBC underwent 
breast-conserving treatment (BCT) and less had axillary lymphadenectomy (ALD). 
Outcomes were more favorable in OBC cases compared with non-OBC cases (p = .002 
for OS, p = .002 for BCSS). Triple-negative (TNBC) and HER2-enriched were the 
subtypes with the worst prognosis in OBC (p < .05). Prognosis was better for 
triple-negative OBC compared with the same subtype of non-OBC. N-stage was not a 
strong prognostic indicator of OBC (p > .05 for OS). Cases who underwent 
systemic chemotherapy alone without surgery had the worst prognosis among OBC 
patients. For locoregional therapy, mastectomy and radiotherapy could confer 
survival advantage; standard axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and positive 
lymph node dissection (PLND) contributed notably to OS in OBC patients. Both OS 
and BCSS were better in OBC cases compared with non-OBC. Systemic chemotherapy 
alone without surgery is not appropriate for OBC treatment, and mastectomy plus 
standard axillary surgery is recommended. Patients with hormone 
receptor-positive and low burden of axillary lymph node metastasis may be spared 
from radiotherapy after undergoing standard axillary lymphadenectomy."
271,"Cancer evolution is explained by accumulation of driver mutations and subsequent 
positive selection by acquired growth advantages like Darwin evolution. However, 
it has not yet been fully investigated whether negative selection of cells that 
have lost malignant properties contributes to cancer progression. Using 
intestinal metastatic tumor-derived organoids carrying Apc, Kras, Tgfbr2, and 
Trp53 quadruple mutations, we show here that approximately 30% of subclones of 
the organoids show loss of metastatic ability to the liver, while keeping the 
driver mutations and oncogenic pathways. Notably, highly metastatic subclones 
also showed gradual loss of metastatic ability during further passages. Such 
non-metastatic subclones showed significantly decreased survival and 
proliferation ability in Matrigel and collagen gel culture conditions, which may 
cause elimination from the tumor tissues in vivo. RNA sequencing indicated that 
stemness-related genes including Lgr5 and Myb were significantly downregulated 
in non-metastatic subclones as well as subclones that lost metastatic ability 
during additional passages. Furthermore, a CGH analysis showed that 
non-metastatic subclones were derived from minor population of parental organoid 
cells. These results indicate that metastatic ability is continuously lost with 
decreased stem cell property in certain subpopulations of malignant tumors, and 
such subpopulations are eliminated by negative selection. Therefore, it is 
possible that cancer evolution is regulated not only by positive selection but 
by negative selection. The mechanism underlying the loss of metastatic ability 
will be an important for future development of therapeutic strategies against 
metastasis."
272,"The association between cholesterol metabolism and cancer development and 
progression has been recently highlighted. However, the role and function of 
many cholesterol transporters remain largely unknown. Herein, we focused on 
ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 9 (ABCA9) transporter given that its 
expression is significantly downregulated in both canine mammary tumors and 
human breast cancers, which in breast cancer patients correlates with poor 
prognosis. We found that ABCA9 is mainly present in the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) and is responsible for promoting cholesterol accumulation in this 
structure. Accordingly, ABCA9 inhibited sterol-regulatory element binding 
protein-2 (SREBP-2) translocation from the ER to the nucleus, a crucial step for 
cholesterol synthesis, resulting in the downregulation of cholesterol synthesis 
gene expression. ABCA9 expression in breast cancer cells attenuated cell 
proliferation and reduced their colony-forming abilities. We identified ABCA9 
expression to be regulated by Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). Inhibition of PI3K 
induced enhanced ABCA9 expression through the activation of PI3K-Akt-FOXO1 
pathway in breast cancer cells. Altogether, our study suggests that ABCA9 
functions as an ER cholesterol transporter that suppresses cholesterol synthesis 
via the inhibition of SREBP-2 signaling and that its restoration halts breast 
cancer cell proliferation. Our findings provide novel insight into a vital role 
of ABCA9 in breast cancer progression."
273,"Duodenal endoscopic submucosal dissection is a high-risk technique; however, 
prophylactic closure of mucosal defects reduces the risk. Unfortunately, we have 
encountered cases where closure is difficult, especially in large lesions. 
Therefore, we developed a novel closure technique, a string clip suturing method 
with an anchor. This study aimed to elucidate the feasibility of this method. 
Five patients underwent this method for the closure of mucosal defects after 
duodenal endoscopic submucosal dissection. The initial string clip was deployed 
at the anal end of the mucosal defects and the second clip was deployed at the 
other end of the mucosal defect. A third clip was deployed on the muscular layer 
in the middle of the mucosal defect. The free end of the string was pulled, and 
additional clips were deployed around the first to the third clips for complete 
closure. Because of grasping the muscle layer, string clip suturing method with 
an anchor can be employed for secure closure without creating a pocket. We 
reviewed the background and clinical course of hospitalization of patients who 
underwent this method. The resected specimens ranged from 52-103 mm in diameter. 
Complete closure of the mucosal defects was possible in all the cases. There 
were no adverse events, and no cases required additional treatment. All the 
patients were discharged within seven days. The new method achieved secure 
closure even for large mucosal defects after duodenal endoscopic submucosal 
dissection. This is a technique that can be applied to other organs, e.g., the 
colon."
274,"As an important endogenous signaling molecule, nitric oxide (NO) is involved in 
various physiological and pathological activities in living organisms. It is 
proved that NO plays a critical role in tumor therapy, while the extremely short 
half-life and nonspecific distribution of NO greatly limit its further clinical 
applications. Thus, the past few decades have witnessed the progress made in 
conquering these shortcomings, including developing innovative NO donors, 
especially smart and multimodal nanoplatforms. These platforms can precisely 
control the spatiotemporal distribution of therapeutic agents in the organism, 
which make big differences in tumor treatment. Here current NO therapeutic 
mechanisms for cancer, NO donors from small molecules to smart-responsive 
nanodrug delivery platforms, and NO-based combination therapy are 
comprehensively reviewed, emphasizing outstanding breakthroughs in these fields 
and hoping to bring new insights into NO-based tumor treatments."
275,"Objective: Emerging adulthood is a vulnerable period for problematic alcohol 
use, defined by a pattern of use associated with physical and functional 
impairment. Obsessive-compulsive psychopathology, which demonstrates high rates 
of onset in emerging adults, seems to be related to problematic alcohol use in 
this age group, consistent with research among the general population suggesting 
an association between emotional disorders and alcohol use in the context of 
coping drinking motives. Pain intensity, another risk factor of problematic 
alcohol use, may link obsessive-compulsive symptoms to problematic alcohol use 
among emerging adults. Therefore, the current study examined the moderating role 
of pain intensity on the association between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and 
problematic alcohol use among emerging adults. Methods: Participants were 198 
college students (81.30% female, Mage = 22.33, SD = 4.38) who reported 
problematic alcohol use. Results: Results from the current study supported a 
significant moderation role of pain intensity for the association between 
obsessive-compulsive symptoms and problematic alcohol use, whereby the 
association between obsessive-compulsive symptoms and problematic alcohol use 
was stronger for emerging adults with high compared to low pain intensity. 
Conclusions: These results highlighted a clinically-relevant interaction between 
obsessive-compulsive symptoms and pain intensity concerning the risk of 
problematic alcohol use among emerging adults as a vulnerable population."
276,"Resistance to anti-cancer therapy is a major challenge for cancer treatment. 
Many studies revealed that macroautophagy/autophagy inhibition can overcome 
autophagy-mediated therapy resistance, but these efforts have not yet led to the 
success of clinical applications. In a recent paper, we established a 37-gene 
autophagy signature to estimate the autophagy status of approximately 10,000 
tumor samples across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and 
muti-omics characterization reveals that autophagy induction may also sensitize 
cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs. These findings provide a comprehensive 
resource of molecular alterations associated with autophagy and highlight the 
potential to utilize drug sensitivity induced by autophagy to overcome the 
resistance of cancer therapy."
277,"BACKGROUND: Progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients who 
received avelumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib as first-line treatment for 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) in a randomized phase III trial. We report 
long-term safety and efficacy of avelumab plus axitinib as first-line treatment 
for patients with aRCC from the JAVELIN Renal 100 phase Ib trial (NCT02493751).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter, phase Ib study, patients 
with untreated aRCC received avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus axitinib 5 mg 
twice daily or with axitinib for 7 days followed by avelumab plus axitinib. 
Safety and efficacy were assessed in all patients receiving at least one dose of 
avelumab or axitinib.
RESULTS: Overall, 55 patients were enrolled and treated. Median follow-up was 
55.7 months (95% CI, 54.5-58.7). Treatment-related adverse events of any grade 
or grade ≥3 occurred in 54 (98.2%) and 34 (61.8%) patients, respectively. The 
confirmed objective response rate was 60.0% (95% CI, 45.9-73.0), including 
complete response in 10.9% of patients. Median duration of response was 35.9 
months (95% CI, 12.7-52.9); the probability of response was 65.8% (95% CI, 
46.7-79.4) at 2 years. Median progression-free survival was 8.3 months (95% CI, 
5.3-32.0). Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI, 40.8-not estimable); 
the 5-year overall survival rate was 57.3% (95% CI, 41.2-70.5).
CONCLUSION: Five-year follow-up for combination treatment with avelumab plus 
axitinib in previously untreated patients with aRCC showed long-term clinical 
activity with no new safety signals, supporting use of this regimen within its 
approved indication in clinical practice (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02493751)."
278,"BACKGROUND: Convolutional neural networks have achieved great success in 
pulmonary nodules detection, which plays an important role in lung 
cancer screening.
PURPOSE: In this paper, we proposed a novel strategy for pulmonary nodule 
detection by learning it from a harder task, which was to transform nodule 
images into normal images. We named this strategy as Pulmonary Nodule Detection 
with Image Category Transformation (PUNDIT).
METHODS: There were two steps for nodules detection, nodule candidate detection 
and false positive reduction. In nodule candidate detection step, a 
segmentation-based framework was built for detection. We designed an image 
category transformation task to translate nodule images into pixel-to-pixel 
normal images and share the information of detection and transformation tasks by 
multi-task learning. As for references of transformation tasks, we proposed 
background consistency losses into standard cycle-consistent adversarial 
networks, which can solve the problem of background uncontrolled changing. A 
three-dimensional network was used in false positive reduction step.
RESULTS: PUNDIT was evaluated in two datasets, cancer screening dataset with 
1186 nodules for cross-validation and cancer treatment dataset with 3668 nodules 
for external test. Results were mainly evaluated by competition performance 
metric (CPM), the average sensitivity at 7 predefined false positive rates. The 
CPM was improved from 0.906 to 0.931 in cancer screening dataset, and from 0.835 
to 0.848 in cancer treatment dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results showed that PUNDIT can improve the performance 
of pulmonary nodules detection effectively. This article is protected by

279,"The family protein of cyclins, as well as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 
cooperating with them, are broadly researched, as a matter of their dysfunction 
may lead to tumor transformation. Cyclins are defined as key regulators that 
have a controlling function of the mammalian nuclear cell divides. Cyclin Y 
(CCNY) is a recently characterized member of the cyclin family and was first 
identified from the human testis cDNA library. It is an actin-binding protein 
acting through decreased actin dynamics at a steady state and during 
glycine-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) and involves the inhibition of 
cofilin activation. What is more, CCNY is a positive regulatory subunit of the 
CDK14/PFTK1 complexes affected by the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway in 
the G2/M phase by recruiting CDK14/PFTK1 to the plasma membrane and promoting 
phosphorylation of LRP6. The expression of CCNY has been significantly mentioned 
within the cell migration and invasion activity both in vivo and in vitro. The 
aim of this review is evaluation of the expression of CCNY in the physiology 
processes and compare the expression of this protein in cancer cells, taking 
into account the impact of the level of expression on tumor progression."
280,"In this study we examine the role of moral values in predicting COVID-19 vaccine 
hesitancy among Black Americans. Guided by moral foundations theory, we assess 
the associations between six moral foundations (care, fairness, loyalty, 
authority, purity, liberty) and attitudes and intentions toward COVID-19 
vaccination. Results of a national survey of Black Americans (N = 1,497) 
indicate that the care and loyalty moral foundations consistently predicted less 
vaccine hesitancy with overall more favorable attitudes and intentions toward 
COVID-19 vaccination, whereas the purity and liberty moral foundations were 
consistently associated with greater vaccine hesitancy. Relationships between 
the foundations and vaccine hesitancy were mediated by perceived vaccine 
effectiveness and safety. Implications of the findings for COVID-19 vaccine 
communication are discussed."
281,"BACKGROUND: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a promising candidate 
blood-based biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis and 
prognostication. The timing of its disease-associated changes, its clinical 
correlates, and biofluid-type dependency will influence its clinical utility.
METHODS: We evaluated plasma, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) GFAP in 
families with autosomal dominant AD (ADAD), leveraging the predictable age at 
symptom onset to determine changes by stage of disease.
RESULTS: Plasma GFAP elevations appear a decade before expected symptom onset, 
after amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation and prior to neurodegeneration and 
cognitive decline. Plasma GFAP distinguished Aβ-positive from Aβ-negative ADAD 
participants and showed a stronger relationship with Aβ load in asymptomatic 
than symptomatic ADAD. Higher plasma GFAP was associated with the degree and 
rate of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Serum GFAP showed similar 
relationships, but these were less pronounced for CSF GFAP.
CONCLUSION: Our findings support a role for plasma GFAP as a clinical biomarker 
of Aβ-related astrocyte reactivity that is associated with cognitive decline and 
neurodegeneration.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) elevations appear a 
decade before expected symptom onset in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease 
(ADAD). Plasma GFAP was associated to amyloid positivity in asymptomatic ADAD. 
Plasma GFAP increased with clinical severity and predicted disease progression. 
Plasma and serum GFAP carried similar information in ADAD, while cerebrospinal 
fluid GFAP did not."
282,"Human lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is an anaerobic glycolytic enzyme involved 
in the inter-conversion of pyruvate to lactate. The level of LDHA in various 
types of cancer cells is found to be elevated and the dependence of cancer cells 
on anaerobic glycolysis is viewed as the reason for this elevation. Moreover, 
inhibition of LDHA activity has been shown to be effective in impairing the 
growth of tumors, making the LDHA as a potential target for cancer therapy. In 
this computational study, we have performed a pharmacophore based screening of 
approved drugs followed by a molecular docking based screening to find a few 
potential LDHA inhibitors. Molecular dynamics simulations have also been 
performed to examine the stability of the LDHA-drug complexes as obtained from 
the docking study. The result of the study showed that darunavir, moxalactam and 
eprosartan can bind to the active site of LDHA with high affinity in comparison 
to two known synthetic inhibitors of LDHA. The results of the molecular dynamics 
simulation showed that these drugs can bind stably with the enzyme through 
hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. Hence, it is concluded that 
darunavir, moxalactam and eprosartan may be considered as potential inhibitors 
of LDHA and can be used for cancer therapy after proper validation of their 
effectiveness through in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials.Communicated by

283,"Identifying the best analytical approach for capturing moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity (MVPA) using accelerometry is complex but inconsistent 
approaches employed in research and surveillance limits comparability. We 
illustrate the use of a consensus method that pools estimates from multiple 
approaches for characterising MVPA using accelerometry. Participants (n = 30) 
wore an accelerometer on their right hip during two laboratory visits. Ten 
individual classification methods estimated minutes of MVPA, including 
cut-point, two-regression, and machine learning approaches, using open-source 
count and raw inputs and several epoch lengths. Results were averaged to derive 
the consensus estimate. Mean MVPA ranged from 33.9-50.4 min across individual 
methods, but only one (38.9 min) was statistically equivalent to the criterion 
of direct observation (38.2 min). The consensus estimate (39.2 min) was 
equivalent to the criterion (even after removal of the one individual method 
that was equivalent to the criterion), had a smaller mean absolute error 
(4.2 min) compared to individual methods (4.9-12.3 min), and enabled the 
estimation of participant-level variance (mean standard deviation: 7.7 min). The 
consensus method allows for addition/removal of methods depending on data 
availability or field progression and may improve accuracy and comparability of 
device-based MVPA estimates while limiting variability due to convergence 
between estimates."
284,"It is not standardised what is the endometrial thickness that discriminates 
between normal and potentially malignant. The objective of this study was to 
determine the endometrial thickness cut-off point from which the risk of 
endometrial cancer (EC) increases in asymptomatic postmenopausal women; and to 
evaluate the risk factors linked to malignant endometrial pathology as well as 
other associated ultrasound findings.This was a retrospective observational 
study that included hysteroscopies performed at the Hospital Materno-Infantil on 
267 asymptomatic menopausal women with an increase in endometrial thickness 
(AET) >5 mm, from 2015 to 2019. The results shows that the prevalence of 
malignant pathology in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with a casual finding 
of endometrial thickening was 3.7%. This percentage was 16.3% when the cut-off 
point of AET was established at 10 mm. There was a significant association for 
the diagnosis of malignant pathology with this cut-off point.There is a 
significant association between the 10 mm endometrial thickness cut-off point 
from which the risk of EC increases in asymptomatic postmenopausal women.Impact 
statementWhat is already known on this subject? Several studies have established 
the cut-off point for asymptomatic endometrial thickening (AET) for atypical 
endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer at 10 mm. Although no cut-off 
point has optimal accuracy for the diagnosis of malignant endometrial pathology, 
it has been found that with a cut-off value of AET >10 mm no cases are missed. 
Likewise, a cut-off point of AET > 11 mm may provide a balance between cancer 
detection and histopathological workup extension.What do the results of this 
study add? A significant association was found at the cut-off point of AET > 
10 mm, which suggests that screening postmenopausal women at this thickness is 
acceptable and unlikely to miss cases of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial 
cancer.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or 
further research? After analysing our results we can conclude, like other 
published studies, that by establishing a cut-off point of 10 mm we obtain a 
good discrimination between benign and malignant pathology, which would allow us 
to diagnose 100% of malignant pathology. Above this cut-off point, the risk of 
endometrial cancer increases, and it would therefore be advisable to extend the 
study. A multicentre study is needed to confirm the cut-off point at which the 
risk of endometrial cancer increases in postmenopausal women with asymptomatic 
endometrial thickening."
285,"Cancer immunotherapy agents fight cancer via immune system stimulation and have 
made significant advances in minimizing side effects and prolonging the survival 
of patients with solid tumors. However, major limitations still exist in cancer 
immunotherapy, including the inefficiency of immune response stimulation in 
specific cancer types, therapy resistance caused by the tumor microenvironment 
(TME), toxicities by the immune imbalance, and short lifetime of stimulator of 
interferon genes (STING) agonist. Recent advances in nanomedicine have shown 
significant potential in overcoming the obstacles of cancer immunotherapy. 
Several nanoscale agents have been reported for cancer immunotherapy, including 
nanoscale cancer vaccines impacting the STING pathway, nanomaterials 
reprogramming TME, nano-agents triggering immune response with immune checkpoint 
inhibitor synergy, ferroptosis-mediated and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 
immunosuppression-mediated cancer immunotherapy, and nanomedicine-meditated 
chimeric antigen receptor-T-cell therapy. Herein, we summarize the major 
advances and innovations in nanomedicine-based cancer immunotherapy, and outline 
the opportunities and challenges to integrate more advanced nanomaterials into

286,"PURPOSE: Clinically, the management of cystic renal masses is tricky. The study 
aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic microwave 
ablation-assisted partial nephrectomy (LMAPN) for cystic renal tumors.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between November 2017 and January 2022, LMAPN was 
performed on 43 patients (29 men and 14 women; age range: 22-80 years; median 
age 54 years) with Bosniak category III (n = 15) or IV (n = 28) cystic renal 
tumors (size range: 1.2-5.0 cm; mean size 2.8 cm). The median follow-up period 
was 26 months (range: 7-56 months). Baseline and perioperative data, 
pathological features, renal function, postoperative complications and oncologic 
outcomes were collected and evaluated.
RESULTS: Forty-three cystic renal tumors were successfully managed by LMAPN. The 
mean operating time was 79 min (range: 40-130 min). The mean time of renal 
pedicle clamping was 19 min (range: 12-25 min). Mean intraoperative blood loss 
was 28.4 mL (range: 10-80 mL). The mean postoperative hospitalization duration 
was 4 days (range: 2-6 days). Negative surgical margins were diagnosed in all 
cases. During the follow-up, no patient appeared with distant metastasis, wound 
or peritoneal cavity implantation. No major but minor complications of 
Clavien-Dindo grade I were encountered after the operation. The 1-, 3- and 
4-year overall survival rate was 100%, 96.6% and 88.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study focusing on LMAPN for cystic renal tumors, 
demonstrating its favorable feasibility, safety and disease control. Long-term 
follow-up is necessary to draw conclusions on the preference and advantages of 
the new therapeutic approach."
287,"An extract from the rhizomes of Cassumunar ginger (Zingiber purpureum Roscoe). 
was found to have significant α-glucosidase inhibitory activity with an IC50 
value of 6.3 µg/mL. Two new phenylbutenoids, cassudimin A (1) and cassumunol N 
(2), and seven known compounds (3-9) were isolated. Their structures and 
relative configurations of two new compounds were elucidated based on spectra 
interpretation. Compounds 1-3, 6-9 showed more potent α-glucosidase inhibitory 
activity than a positive control, acarbose (IC50 = 168.0 µM). Dehydrozingerone 
(6) exhibited the most potent α-glucosidase inhibition with an IC50 value of 
8.3 μM. Compounds 7 and 9 were found in Z. purpureum rhizomes for the first 
time."
288,"OBJECTIVE: To assess a novel intraoperative core biopsy technique to provide 
enhanced guidance in partial glossectomies.
METHODS: All patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue 
were eligible for study participation. Following anesthesia, the planned 
resection and three points midway between the gross tumor and the intended 
ablation were marked. A core biopsy was performed with a needle spring on each 
point and sent for frozen sections. The initially planned resection was executed 
if the cores returned free of tumor. In case of a positive core biopsy, a new 
1-1.5 cm margin was marked around that point. The main outcome measure was the 
closest final margin diameter, especially the deep ones. Other outcome measures 
were the core biopsies' sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value. 
Complications were recorded.
RESULTS: The final margins of 10 patients undergoing intraoperative core 
biopsies and 20 matched controls were analyzed. One patient had two positive 
cores and final negative margins after modifying the resection accordingly. 
Another patient had a positive biopsy diagnosed only on final pathology, and one 
close final margin. Patients that were operated with the new technique had 
larger margins compared to the controls: median (interquartile range) closest 
margin 5.95 (3.97; 9.63) mm versus 4 (2.25; 5) mm (p = 0.074) and median deep 
margin 8.6 (6.16; 10) mm versus 5 (3;10) mm (p = 0.411), respectively. There 
were no complications.
CONCLUSION: A novel pre-resection intraoperative biopsy technique is presented. 
Core biopsies taken during glossectomies have the potential to prevent 
inadequate margins.

289,"Ras homologue family member C (RhoC) is an oncogene in diverse types of human 
cancers, whereas its regulatory mechanisms involving macrophage polarization is 
rarely investigated. This study is designed to explore the regulatory role of 
RhoC in colon cancer and the underlying molecular mechanisms involving 
macrophage polarization. We detected RhoC expression by quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot, and analysed the 
biological function of RhoC knockdown in CC cells by the MTT, wound healing and 
transwell assay. Macrophage polarization-associated markers, genes associated 
with migration, phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and forkhead box O 
(FOXO) were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot. The xenograft tumour mouse 
model was used to assess the role of RhoC in vivo. RhoC is highly expressed in 
CC cells. The cell viability, invasion and migration abilities of CC cells were 
reduced by knockdown of RhoC. RhoC knockdown promoted M1 polarization, inhibited 
M2 polarization and decreased levels of genes associated with migration (matrix 
metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9). Silencing of RhoC inhibited 
tumour growth and expression of genes associated with migration in the 
xenografted model. In addition, silencing of RhoC promoted PTEN/FOXO1 
expression, and PTEN inhibitor (SF1670) reversed the inhibitory effects of RhoC 
silencing. We demonstrated that silencing of RhoC reduced CC cells invasion and 
migration, and tumour growth by suppressing M2 macrophage polarization via 
regulating the PTEN/FOXO1 pathway."
290,"The aime of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of 
autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR) expression in a variety of human 
invasive micropapillary carcinomas (IMPC). AMFR expression was compared in 111 
samples of a variety of human IMPCs which had intrinsic non-micropapillary 
components and with 26 cases of control pulmonary adenocarcinoma (CPA, carcinoma 
without an IMPC component) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In the 137 cases 
analysed, AMFR expression was significantly elevated in the IMPC components 
compared to the non-IMPC components (p = .005) and normal tissues (p < .001). 
AMFR expression was also higher in the IMPC samples compared to their intrinsic 
non-IMPC components (p = .0234). Between the 69 cases of lung IMPC and 26 cases 
of CPA, AMFR expression was notably higher in the IMPC components than in the 
CPA components (p = .0455). However, there was no significant difference between 
the non-IMPC components in the lung and the CPA components (p = .4584). 
Moreover, in breast cancer, elevated AMFR expression was not significantly 
correlated with mixed type or pure type IMPC (p = .5969) or with age, gender, T 
stage, or lymph node metastasis (LNM). Between IMPC and CPA of the lung, there 
was no statistical significance in age, T stage, and LNM, where AMFR expression 
was higher in IMPC (p = .0071). Thus this study demonstrated that AMFR was 
overexpressed in a variety of human IMPC components compared with 
non-micropapillary components. This suggests that AMFR expression is a potential 
new prognostic indicator for different types of human IMPC, which might thus be 
a new therapeutic target."
291,"INTRODUCTION: The introduction of effective human papillomavirus (HPV) 
vaccination, screening, and treatment programs has led the World Health 
Organization to call for the global elimination of cervical cancer. Assessing 
progress towards this goal is supported through monitoring vaccination coverage 
and its impact.
AREAS COVERED: We performed a targeted review to assess the characteristics of 
HPV-related data systems from seven high-income countries (HICs) that 
represented varied approaches, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, 
Scotland, Sweden, and the United States (US). Included data systems focused on 
preventive and early detection measures: HPV vaccination and cervical screening 
programs, as well as HPV-related disease outcomes. Differences were observed in 
approach to development of data systems, along with variation in geographical 
scope and methods of data collection.
A challenge exists in how to best follow-up the ongoing global-scale elimination 
efforts in a comprehensive manner. These sources provide a wealth of information 
regarding the strengths and limitations of, and notable variation among, current 
data systems used in HICs. This review can inform improvements to existing 
prevention programs and the implementation of new programs in other countries, 
and thus support optimization of cervical cancer prevention policy."
292,"BACKGROUND: Castration-resistance is common in advanced prostatic 
adenocarcinomas (PACs) treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and 
usually occurs after 2 years following treatment. A minority of PACs confer 
innate ADT resistance without prior hormonal treatment. The expression of HMWCK 
in PAC cells has not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the 
clinicopathologic and genomic features of HMWCK-expressing PACs and the 
relationship to ADT resistance.
METHODS: A total of 469 PACs were studied for HMWCK expression (39 
postradiotherapy, 57 post-ADT, 373 treatment-naïve PACs). Clinicopathologic 
correlations of the HMWCK expression with tumor grade groups, specific tumor 
morphologies, tumor stages and disease recurrence/persistence/progression were 
performed. Five HMWCK+ PACs were also sequenced for genetic alterations.
RESULTS: Thirty one of the 469 cases (6.6%) showed variable HMWCK+ PAC. The 
HMWCK+ PAC often focally presented in the tumor and vast majority were 
associated with high Gleason scores and unfavorable growth patterns (cribriform, 
comedo-necrosis, and intraductal carcinoma) as well as high tumor stages. A 
small percentage of the HMWCK+ PCA (2/31, 6.5%) presented with frank squamous 
histomorphology. Vast majority (22/31, 87%) had no history of prior ADT. The 
HMWCK+ PAC all displayed diminished to lost expression of AR/NKX3.1. Most of the 
cases progressed within 12 months of ADT or disease persisted despite ADT. Of 
the 5 HMWCK+ PACs subjected to gene sequencing, 4 presented with PTEN/PI3K/MAPK 
pathway alterations.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated HMWCK+ PAC to be a novel type of innate 
ADT-resistant PAC. Overexpression of HMWCK in PAC can be potentially used as a 
surrogate biomarker for aggressive and innate hormone-refractory PACs. The 
genetic alterations imply potential therapeutic implications of PI3K/MAPK 
inhibitors in the treatment of these deadly diseases."
293,"BACKGROUND: Like DNA methylation, histone modifications are considered important 
processes for epigenetic alterations in gene function, and abnormally high 
expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) plays a key role in many human 
diseases. In addition to regulating the acetylation levels of histone and 
non-histone proteins and gene transcription, HDAC inhibitors as antitumor drugs 
can also affect the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway in tumor cells. Prostate 
cancer (PCa) is one of the most heritable malignancies in which DDR pathway 
defects can be detected in a considerable proportion of cases. Such defects are 
more prevalent in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and are highly 
enriched in metastatic lesions. There is currently evidence that DDR 
pathway-deficient PCa is associated with high-risk biological behaviors and 
response sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. Platinum-based drugs have 
been used in multiple clinical trials as monotherapy or in combination with 
other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of CRPC.
METHODS: This study evaluated the combined anticancer effect of (cisplatin) CDDP 
and the HDAC inhibitors vorinostat (SAHA) on three androgen-dependent cell lines 
PC-3, DU-145, and C4-2B in vitro. The efficacy and safety of SAHA combined with 
CDDP in the treatment of CRPC were further verified through animal experiments.
RESULTS: The combination of the two drugs increases cytotoxic effects by 
increasing DNA damage. Our results showed that the SAHA could not only reduce 
the expression of homologous recombinant repair proteins BRCA2, BRCA1, PARP1, 
and RAD51, but also decrease enzymes that Reduce the key enzymes of GSH 
biosynthesis, GSS and GCLC, and GSTP1 which can catalyze the binding of GSH to 
cisplatin. The intracellular GSH level also decreased with the increase of SAHA 
concentration, at the same time, the content of intracellular Pt element.
CONCLUSION: The combination of CDDP and SAHA can produce synergistic anticancer 
effects in androgen-independent PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results open 
up a new avenue for the effective treatment of CRPC. To optimize the 
chemotherapy regimen for patients with advanced PCa, it is necessary to further 
study the molecular mechanism of platinum drugs, HDAC inhibitors, and their 
combined action."
294,"In advanced HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC), the new antibody-drug 
conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is more effective compared to 
trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). However, T-DXd can have significant toxicities, 
and the right treatment sequence is unknown. Biomarkers to guide the use of 
anti-HER2 therapies beyond HER2 status are needed. Here, we evaluated if 
pre-established levels of ERBB2 mRNA expression according to the HER2DX 
standardized assay are associated with response and survival following T-DM1. In 
ERBB2 low, medium, and high groups, the overall response rate was 0%, 29% and 
56%, respectively (P<.001). ERBB2 mRNA was significantly associated with better 
progression-free survival (p = 0.002) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.02). These 
findings were independent of HER2 IHC levels, hormone receptor, age, brain 
metastasis and line of therapy. The HER2DX risk-score (P=.04) and the 
immunoglobulin (IGG) signature (P=.04) were significantly associated with OS 
since diagnosis. HER2DX provides prognostic and predictive information following 
T-DM1 in advanced HER2+ BC."
295,"MOTIVATION: As non-coding driver mutations move more into the focus of cancer 
research, a comprehensive and easy to use software solution for regulatory 
variant analysis and data visualization is highly relevant. The interpretation 
of regulatory variants in large tumor genome cohorts requires specialized 
analysis and visualization of multiple layers of data, including for example 
breakpoints of structural variants, enhancer elements and additional available 
gene locus annotation, in the context of changes in gene expression.
RESULTS: We introduce a user-friendly tool, Revana (REgulatory Variant 
ANAlysis), that can aggregate and visually represent regulatory variants from 
cancer genomes in a gene-centric manner. It requires whole genome (WGS) and RNA 
sequencing (RNA-Seq) data of a cohort of tumor samples and creates interactive 
HTML reports summarizing the most important regulatory events.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Revana is implemented in R and JavaScript. It 
is available for download as an R package under

296,"MOTIVATION: In the training of predictive models using high-dimensional genomic 
data, multiple studies' worth of data are often combined to increase sample size 
and improve generalizability. A drawback of this approach is that there may be 
different sets of features measured in each study due to variations in 
expression measurement platform or technology. It is often common practice to 
work only with the intersection of features measured in common across all 
studies, which results in the blind discarding of potentially useful feature 
information that is measured in individual or subsets of studies.
RESULTS: We characterize the loss in predictive performance incurred by using 
only the intersection of feature information available across all studies when 
training predictors using gene expression data from microarray and sequencing 
datasets. We study the properties of linear and polynomial regression for 
imputing discarded features and demonstrate improvements in the external 
performance of prediction functions through simulation and in gene expression 
data collected on breast cancer patients. To improve this process, we propose a 
pairwise strategy that applies any imputation algorithm to two studies at a time 
and averages imputed features across pairs. We demonstrate that the pairwise 
strategy is preferable to first merging all datasets together and imputing any 
resulting missing features. Finally, we provide insights on which subsets of 
intersected and study-specific features should be used so that missing-feature 
imputation best promotes cross-study replicability.

297,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between Barthel Index (BI), which 
measures level of patients independence during daily living activities (ADL), 
and perioperative outcomes in a large cohort of consecutive bladder cancer (BCa) 
patients, who underwent radical cystectomy (RC) at a tertiary referral center.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated data from clinically nonmetastatic BCa 
patients treated with RC between 2015 and 2022. For each patient, BI was 
assessed preoperatively. According to BI score, patients were divided into three 
groups: ≤60 (total/severe dependency) vs. 65-90 (moderate dependency) vs. 95-100 
(slight dependency/independency). Regression analyses tested the association 
between BI score and major postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo >2), 
length of in-hospital stay (LOHS), 90-days readmission, and total costs.
RESULTS: Overall, 288 patients were included. According to BI score, the patient 
cohort was distributed as follows: 4% (n = 11) BI ≤60 vs. 15% (n = 42) BI 65-90 
vs. 81% (n = 235) BI 95-100. Patients with BI ≤60 had more frequent 
ureterocutaneostomy performed, shorter operative time, higher rates of 
postoperative complications, longer LOHS, higher rates of readmission, and were 
associated with higher total costs, compared to patients with BI 65-90 and 
95-100. In multivariable regression models, BI ≤60 remained an independent 
predictor of increased risk of major postoperative complications (odds ratio: 
6.62, p = 0.006), longer LOHS (rate ratio: 1.25, p < 0.001), and higher costs 
(β: 2.617, p = 0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: Total/severe dependency in ADL assessed by BI was associated with 
higher rates of major postoperative complications, longer hospitalization, and 
higher costs in BCa patients treated with RC. BI assessment should be considered 
during patients selection process and counseling before surgery."
298,"In the ICRU Report 90, the uncertainty of the recommendation for ${{W}}_{{air}}$ 
was changed from 0.15 to 0.35%. The purpose of this study is to develop an 
absolute measurement system for ${{W}}_{{air}}$ in electrons with lower 
uncertainty using 60Co gamma rays. ${{W}}_{{air}}$ was determined by the ratio 
of the energy deposition to the number of ion pairs created in a given volume of 
air using a graphite calorimeter and a graphite-wall ionisation chamber. The 
obtained value for ${{W}}_{{air}}$ was 33.91 eV with a relative standard 
uncertainty of 0.08 eV (k = 1), and was in good agreement with the recommended 
value of the ICRU Report 90 (33.97 eV). Additionally, the uncertainty for 
${{W}}_{{air}}$ obtained in this investigation is 0.23% and is comparable with 
that reported by Burns et al., which is the lowest uncertainty in recent studies 
determining ${{W}}_{{air}}$ In the future, the proposed system can be used to 
measure ${{W}}_{{air}}$ in high-energy electron beams."
299,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a kind of malignant tumor with high 
incidence and mortality in the digestive system. The aim of this study is to 
explore the function of lnc-ABCA12-3 in the development of ESCC and its unique 
mechanisms. RT-PCR was applied to detect gene transcription levels in tissues or 
cell lines like TE-1, EC9706, and HEEC cells. Western blot was conducted to 
identify protein expression levels of mitochondrial apoptosis and toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. CCK-8 and 
EdU assays were carried out to measure cell proliferation, and cell apoptosis 
was examined by flow cytometry. ELISA was used for checking the changes in 
glycolysis-related indicators. Lnc-ABCA12-3 was highly expressed in ESCC tissues 
and cells, which preferred it to be a candidate target. The TE-1 and EC9706 
cells proliferation and glycolysis were obviously inhibited with the 
downregulation of lnc-ABCA12-3, while apoptosis was promoted. TLR4 activator 
could largely reverse the apoptosis acceleration and relieved the proliferation 
and glycolysis suppression caused by lnc-ABCA12-3 downregulation. Moreover, the 
effect of lnc-ABCA12-3 on ESCC cells was actualized by activating the TLR4/NF-κB 
signaling pathway under the mediation of exosome. Taken together, the 
lnc-ABCA12-3 could promote the proliferation and glycolysis of ESCC, while 
repressing its apoptosis probably by regulating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway 
under the mediation of exosome."
300,"Spinal nerve injury causes mechanical allodynia and structural imbalance of 
neurotransmission, which were typically associated with calcium overload. 
Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is considered crucial elements-mediating 
intracellular calcium homeostasis, ion channel activity, and synaptic 
plasticity. However, the underlying mechanism of SOCE in mediating neuronal 
transmitter release and synaptic transmission remains ambiguous in neuropathic 
pain. Neuropathic rats were operated by spinal nerve ligations. 
Neurotransmissions were assessed by whole-cell recording in substantia 
gelatinosa. Immunofluorescence staining of STIM1 with neuronal and glial 
biomarkers in the spinal dorsal horn. The endoplasmic reticulum stress level was 
estimated from qRT-PCR. Intrathecal injection of SOCE antagonist SKF96365 
dose-dependently alleviated mechanical allodynia in ipsilateral hind paws of 
neuropathic rats with ED50 of 18 μg. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated 
that STIM1 was specifically and significantly expressed in neurons but not 
astrocytes and microglia in the spinal dorsal horn. Bath application of SKF96365 
inhibited enhanced miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in a 
dosage-dependent manner without affecting miniature inhibitory postsynaptic 
currents. Mal-adaption of SOCE was commonly related to endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) stress in the central nervous system. SKF96365 markedly suppressed ER 
stress levels by alleviating mRNA expression of C/EBP homologous protein and 
heat shock protein 70 in neuropathic rats. Our findings suggested that nerve 
injury might promote SOCE-mediated calcium levels, resulting in long-term 
imbalance of spinal synaptic transmission and behavioral sensitization, SKF96365 
produces antinociception by alleviating glutamatergic transmission and ER 
stress. This work demonstrated the involvement of SOCE in neuropathic pain, 
implying that SOCE might be a potential target for pain management."
301,"Carboplatin, an advanced anticancer drug with excellent efficacy against ovarian 
cancer, was developed to alleviate the side effects that often occur with 
cisplatin and other platinum-based compounds. Our study reports the in vitro 
characteristics, viability, and activity of cells expressing the inducible 
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene after carboplatin was conjugated with 
polysuccinimide (PSI) and administered in combination with other widely used 
anticancer drugs. PSI, which has promising properties as a drug delivery 
material, could provide a platform for prolonging carboplatin release, 
regulating its dosage, and improving its side effects. The iNOS gene has been 
shown to play an important role in both cancer cell survival and inhibition. 
Herein, we synthesized a PSI-carboplatin conjugate to create a modified 
anticancer agent and confirmed its successful conjugation. To ensure its 
solubility in water, we further modified the structure of the PSI-carboplatin 
conjugate with 2-aminoethanol groups. To validate its biological 
characteristics, the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 and normal ovarian Chinese 
hamster ovary cells were treated with the PSI-carboplatin conjugate alone and in 
combination with paclitaxel and topotecan, both of which are used in 
conventional chemotherapy. Notably, PSI-carboplatin conjugation can be used to 
predict changes in the genes involved in cancer growth and inhibition. In 
conclusion, combination treatment with the newly synthesized polymer-carboplatin 
conjugate and paclitaxel displayed anticancer activity against ovarian cancer 
cells but was not toxic to normal ovarian cancer cells, resulting in the 
development of an effective candidate anticancer drug without severe side 
effects."
302,"The poor outcome of advanced ovarian cancer under conventional therapy 
necessitates new strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy. β-glucosidase 
(encoded by GBA) is a lysosomal enzyme and is involved in sphingolipids 
metabolism. Recent studies revealed that β-glucosidase plays a role in cancer 
development and chemoresistance. In this work, we systematically evaluated the 
expression and role of GBA in ovarian cancer. Our work demonstrates that 
inhibition of β-glucosidase has therapeutic potential for ovarian cancer. Gene 
Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database, western blot and 
immunohistochemistry analyses of patient samples demonstrated that GBA mRNA and 
protein expression levels were significantly increased in ovarian cancer 
compared to normal tissues. Functional studies using gain-of- function and 
loss-of-function approaches demonstrated that GBA overexpression did not affect 
growth and migration but alleviated cisplatin's efficacy in ovarian cancer 
cells. In addition, GBA depletion resulted in growth inhibition, apoptosis 
induction, and enhancement of cisplatin's efficacy. Of note, we found that GBA 
inhibition specifically decreased receptor tyrosine kinase AXL level, leading to 
the suppression of AXL-mediated signaling pathways. Our data suggest that GBA 
represents a promising target to inhibit AXL signaling and overcome cisplatin 
resistance in ovarian cancer."
303,"OBJECTIVES: Accurately predicting of progression is important for patients with 
non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). We previously reported that bladder 
neck involvement (BNI) was significantly associated with progression of NMIBC. 
In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of the detailed BNI 
location in NMIBC patients.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 651 patients diagnosed with primary NMIBC 
at a single center between 2000 and 2018. Using the detailed BNI location, 
patients were divided into the following three groups: dorsal BNI (BNId; 4 to 8 
o'clock position), ventral BNI (BNIv; 8 to 4 o'clock but not 4 to 8 o'clock 
position), and non-BNI group. Both time to progression to muscle-invasive 
disease and distant metastasis was compared among the three groups. A prognostic 
model was developed and its discriminative ability was evaluated.
RESULTS: Dorsal bladder neck involvement and BNIv were observed in 43 (6.6%) and 
36 (5.5%) patients, respectively. During a median follow-up of 61 months, 35 
(5.4%) patients progressed. The cumulative incidence at 5 years was 12%, 0%, and 
5.0% in BNId, BNIv, and non-BNI groups, respectively. On multivariate analysis, 
BNId was a significant and independent risk factor for progression, tumor stage 
pT1, and histologic grade G3. One point was assigned to each factor, and 
patients were classified into four well-stratified prognostic groups based on 
the total score.
CONCLUSION: Dorsal bladder neck involvement was an independent and significant 
risk factor for progression in primary NMIBC. Our simple and practical 
prognostic model including BNId is easy to use and may help selecting the 
optimal treatment and its timing."

senescence-like features is not fully understood.
METHODS: We irradiated human epidermal keratinocytes with 12 J/cm2 of UVA to 
establish an in vitro photoaging model. Then we employed whole-transcriptome 
sequencing and O2K mitochondrial function assay to reveal the photoprotective 
mechanisms of liquiritigenin (LQ).
DISCUSSION: We found that skin reduces endogenous ROS by promoting mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling in response to UVA-induced damage. However, 
this also causes excessive consumption and idling of nutrients, leading to the 
inhibition of cell proliferation, and ultimately accelerating the skin aging 
process. Here, we demonstrated that LQ can reduce stress in keratinocytes, 
increase oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production efficiency, and block the 
massive loss of skin nutrients and net energy stress. Furthermore, LQ can 
promote collagen synthesis and keratinocyte proliferation through the PI3K-AKT 
pathway, thereby reversing photoaging.
CONCLUSION: This work provides a new skin aging mechanism and solution strategy 
with high clinical translation value."
305,"PURPOSE: The use of robot-assisted surgery for rectal cancer is increasing, but 
the pathological outcomes have not been fully clarified. We compared the 
surgical and pathological outcomes between robot-assisted and open surgery in 
specimens from patients operated on for rectal cancer.
METHODS: All patients who underwent resection for rectal cancer from 2016 to 
2018 were included. Specimens were divided into 3 sections to analyze the 
pathology of the lymph nodes (LNs) (n=137).
RESULTS: The total specimen lengths were shorter in the robot-assisted group 
than in the open surgery group (mean± standard deviation: 29.1±8.6 cm vs. 
33.8±9.9 cm, P=0.004) because of a shorter proximal resection margin (21.7±8.7 
vs. 26.4±10.6 cm, P=0.006). The number of recruited LNs (35.8±21.8 vs. 
39.6±16.5, P=0.604) and arterial vessel length (8.84±2.6 cm vs. 8.78±2.4 cm, 
P=0.891) did not differ significantly between the 2 surgical approaches. LN 
metastases were found in 33 of 137 samples (24.1%), but the numbers did not 
differ significantly between the procedures. Among these 33 cases, metastatic 
LNs were located in the mesorectum (75.8%), in the sigmoid colon mesentery 
(33.3%), and at the arterial ligation site of the inferior mesenteric artery 
(12.1%). The circumferential resection margin and the proportion of complete 
mesorectal fascia were comparable between the groups.
CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences between the 2 surgical 
approaches regarding arterial vessel length, recruitment of LN metastases, and 
resection margins."
306,"With the rapid development of new anti-cancer agents which are cytostatic, new 
endpoints are needed to better measure treatment efficacy in phase II trials. 
For this purpose, Von Hoff (1998) proposed the growth modulation index (GMI), 
that is, the ratio between times to progression or progression-free survival 
times in two successive treatment lines. An essential task in studies using GMI 
as an endpoint is to estimate the distribution of GMI. Traditional methods for 
survival data have been used for estimating the GMI distribution because 
censoring is common for GMI data. However, we point out that the independent 
censoring assumption required by traditional survival methods is always violated 
for GMI, which may lead to severely biased results. In this paper, we construct 
both nonparametric and parametric estimators for the distribution of GMI, 
accounting for the dependent censoring of GMI. Extensive simulation studies show 
that our nonparametric estimators perform well in practical situations and 
outperform existing estimators, and our parametric estimators perform better 
than our nonparametric estimators and existing estimators when the parametric 
model is correctly specified. A phase II clinical trial using GMI as the primary 
endpoint is provided for illustration."
307,"Aberrant DNA methylation is the most common molecular lesion that is crucial for 
the occurrence and development of cancer, but has thus far been underappreciated 
as a clinical tool for cancer classification, diagnosis or as a guide for 
therapeutic decisions. Partly, this has been due to a lack of proven algorithms 
that can use methylation data to stratify patients into clinically relevant risk 
groups and subtypes that are of prognostic importance. Here, we proposed a novel 
Bayesian model to capture the methylation signatures of different subtypes from 
paired normal and tumor methylation array data. Application of our model to 
synthetic and empirical data showed high clustering accuracy, and was able to 
identify the possible epigenetic cause of a cancer subtype."
308,"Drug response prediction is an important problem in personalized cancer therapy. 
Among various newly developed models, significant improvement in prediction 
performance has been reported using deep learning methods. However, systematic 
comparisons of deep learning methods, especially of the transferability from 
preclinical models to clinical cohorts, are currently lacking. To provide a more 
rigorous assessment, the performance of six representative deep learning methods 
for drug response prediction using nine evaluation metrics, including the 
overall prediction accuracy, predictability of each drug, potential associated 
factors and transferability to clinical cohorts, in multiple application 
scenarios was benchmarked. Most methods show promising prediction within cell 
line datasets, and TGSA, with its lower time cost and better performance, is 
recommended. Although the performance metrics decrease when applying models 
trained on cell lines to patients, a certain amount of power to distinguish 
clinical response on some drugs can be maintained using CRDNN and TGSA. With 
these assessments, we provide a guidance for researchers to choose appropriate 
methods, as well as insights into future directions for the development of more 
effective methods in clinical scenarios."
309,"BACKGROUNDS/AIMS: Locally advanced gallbladder cancer (GBC) is associated with 
survival limited to a few months. Extended resections (ER) are occasionally 
performed in this group and outcomes remain inconclusive. This study assessed 
outcomes after ER for locally advanced GBC.
METHODS: Patients who underwent ER for GBC between 2011 and 2020 were reviewed. 
ER was defined as a major hepatectomy alone (n = 9), a pancreaticoduodenectomy 
(PD) with or without minor hepatectomy (n = 3), a major hepatectomy with PD 
(HPD) (n = 3) or vascular resection and reconstruction (n = 4). We assessed 
30-day morbidity, mortality, and 2-year overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Among 19 patients, negative margins were achieved in 14 (73.6%). The 
30-day mortality was 1/9 (11.1%) for a major hepatectomy, 0/3 (0%) for a minor 
HPD, 2/3 (66.7%) for a major HPD, and 1/4 (25.0%) for vascular resection. All 
short term survivors (< 6 months) (n=8) had preoperative jaundice and 6/8 
(75.0%) underwent a major HPD or vascular resection. There were five (26.3%) 
long term survivors. The median OS in patients with and without preoperative 
jaundice was 4.1 months (0.7-11.1 months) and 13.7 months (12-30.4 months), 
respectively (p = 0.009) (2-year OS = 7% vs. 75%; p = 0.008). The median OS in 
patients who underwent a major hepatectomy alone or a minor HPD was 11.3 months 
(6.8-17.3 months) versus 1.4 months (0.3-4.1 months) (p = 0.02) in patients who 
underwent major HPD or vascular resection (2 year OS = 33% vs. not reached) (p = 
0.010) respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients with GBC, when ER is limited to a major 
hepatectomy alone, or a minor HPD, acceptable survival can be achieved."
310,"Therapeutic application of vaccines to endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains 
uncertain. In this study, we aimed to identify potential tumor antigens for use 
in the development of an anti-tumor mRNA vaccine and clarify immune subtypes and 
their characteristics for immunotherapeutic application in heterogeneous EC by 
integrating multi-omics data. Importantly, four potential tumor antigen 
candidates-PGR, RBPJ, PARVG, and MSX1-were identified and significantly 
correlated with better overall survival, disease-free survival, and distinct 
antigen-presenting cell infiltration in EC. In addition, two different immune 
subtypes by consensus clustering analysis of the immune-related genes were 
identified. Patients with C2 immunophenotypes exhibited superior survival 
outcomes and ""hot"" immunoreactivity and harbored higher microsatellite 
instability scores and tumoral mutation burden but lower copy-number variation 
burden. Furthermore, the distinct expression of immunogenic cell death 
modulators and differential microenvironmental characteristics of immune-cell 
infiltration were also revealed between C1 and C2 immune-subtype tumors. 
Enrichment analysis of the co-expression of immune-related genes showed 
enrichment in immune response, immune cell-mediated immunity, and antigen 
processing pathways. These results indicated that these identified tumor 
antigens can be used for developing antitumor mRNA vaccines, and tumors with C2 
immunophenotypic characteristics demonstrated sensitivity and susceptibility to 
immunotherapy in EC."
311,"OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidences indicate that a distinct CD11c+ T-bet+ B cell 
subset termed age/autoimmune-associated B cells (ABCs) is the major pathogenic 
autoantibody producer in lupus. Human lupus is associated with significant 
metabolic alterations, but how ABCs orchestrate their typical transcription 
factors (TFs) and metabolic programs to meet specific functional requirements is 
unclear. Our goal is to characterize the metabolism of ABCs and identify the 
regulators of metabolic pathways for developing new therapies for ABC-mediated 
autoimmunity.
METHODS: We developed a T-bet-tdTomato reporter mouse strain to trace live 
T-bet+ B cells and adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells from Bm12 mice to induce 
lupus. Then CD11c+ tdTomato+ B cells were sorted and conducted RNA sequencing 
and extracellular flux assay. Metabolic restriction to constrain ABC formation 
was tested on human and mouse B cells. The metabolic intervention was conducted 
in the Bm12-induced lupus model.
RESULTS: ABCs exhibited a hypermetabolic state with enhanced glycolytic 
capacity. The increased glycolytic rate in ABCs was promoted by IFN-γ signaling. 
T-bet, a downstream TF of IFN-γ, regulated the gene program of the glycolysis 
pathway in ABCs by repressing the expression of Bcl6. Functionally, glycolysis 
restriction could impair ABC formation. The engagement of glycolysis promoted 
survival and terminal differentiation of antibody-secreting cells. 
Administration of glycolysis inhibitor ameliorated ABCs accumulation and 
autoantibody production in Bm12-induced lupus model.
CONCLUSION: T-bet can couple immune signals and metabolic programming to 
establish pathogenic ABC formation and functional capacities. Modulating ABC 
favored metabolic program could be a novel therapeutic approach for lupus. This

312,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the IL-6 
superfamily. LIF was initially discovered as a factor to induce the 
differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells and thus inhibit their proliferation. 
Subsequent studies have highlighted the multi-functions of LIF under a wide 
variety of physiological and pathological conditions in a highly cell-, tissue-, 
and context-dependent manner. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that LIF plays 
essential roles in the stem cell niche, where it maintains the homeostasis and 
regeneration of multiple somatic tissues, including intestine, neuron, and 
muscle. Further, LIF exerts a crucial regulatory role in immunity, and functions 
as a protective factor against many immunopathological diseases, such as 
infection, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and graft-verse-host disease 
(GVHD). It is worth noting that while LIF displays a tumor-suppressive function 
in leukemia, recent studies have highlighted the oncogenic role of LIF in many 
types of solid tumors, further demonstrating the complexities and 
context-dependent effects of LIF. In this review, we summarize the recent 
insights into the roles and mechanisms of LIF in stem cell homeostasis and 
regeneration, immunity, and cancer, and discuss the potential therapeutic 
options for human diseases by modulating LIF levels and functions."

317,"Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor among women all over the world. 
In 2020, there were about 416 000 new cases, and more than 117 000 deaths of 
breast cancer in Chinese female. Of the new cases of breast cancer each year, 
about 3% to 10% of patients have distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Of 
the early-stage patients, about 30% developed into advanced breast cancer. The 
5-year survival rate of advanced breast cancer was only 20%, and the median 
overall survival was 2-3 years. Although advanced breast cancer is difficult to 
cure at present, we can alleviate the clinical symptoms of patients, improve 
their quality of life and further prolong their survival time by applying new 
therapeutic drugs and optimizing treatment models, to achieve the purpose of 
long-term survival with tumor. It is very important for patients with advanced 
breast cancer to choose the reasonable treatment plan, and because of the lack 
of standard recommendation for the treatment of advanced breast cancer after the

is toxic to mpt5-Δ mutants and to diploids entering stationary phase and 
quiescence. The ssd1-Δ null shows no toxicity, indicating that ssd1-2 is 
disrupting an essential function that does not solely require Ssd1p. ssd1-2

319,"BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) is a widely used method for the staging of 
colon cancer. Accurate reports could lead to a better preoperative evaluation 
and planning of the treatment of colon cancer.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of CT free-text reports and structured report 
templates when it comes to staging CT imaging of colon cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multiple choice questionnaire survey was conducted over 
four weeks. Online questionnaire software was used, and a link was shared to 
medical doctors with help from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group (DCCG) and 
from a social media radiologist group.
RESULTS: Clinicians preferred the template style (95%), whereas the level of 
support was lower among the radiologists (76%). All female responders preferred 
the template style, in contrast to only 84% of the male responders. Furthermore, 
the survey showed a slightly deficient level of the national CT reporting 
quality; only 7/13 questions and sub-questions, concerning CT report quality, 
achieved an approval rate >85%. The colorectal cancer multidisciplinary team 
consultants who always or usually work with template style reporting of CT scans 
of colon cancer tend to be more satisfied with the quality and content of the 
reports, compared to those who rarely use or read template reports.
CONCLUSION: The following indicators were insufficiently reported: tumor 
invasion growth; number of hepatic metastases; segment location of hepatic 
metastasis; and retroperitoneal lymph node involvement. In the template reports

320,"OBJECTIVES: The present study comprehensively investigated the significance of 
several factors reflecting the therapeutic effects of anticancer treatment on 
overall survival (OS) in advanced urothelial cancer (UC) patients receiving 
sequential systemic therapy.
METHODS: This study included 101 consecutive advanced UC patients who received 
first-line platinum-based combination chemotherapy followed by second-line 
pembrolizumab. The impacts of the following factors on OS in these patients were 
analyzed: responses to chemotherapy, responses to pembrolizumab, 
progression-free survival (PFS) with chemotherapy, PFS with pembrolizumab, and 
second PFS (PFS2).
RESULTS: The median age of patients was 71 years, and 35 and 66 had UC in the 
upper urinary tract and bladder, respectively. objective response rate to 
first-line chemotherapy and second-line pembrolizumab were 37.6% and 19.8%, 
respectively. Median PFS with chemotherapy, pembrolizumab, and PFS2 were 5, 4, 
and 9 months, respectively. Uni- and multivariate analyses of the five factors 
examined identified PFS with pembrolizumab and PFS2 as independent surrogates 
for OS, with PFS2 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.23) being more closely associated with 
OS than PFS with pembrolizumab (HR = 0.31). Furthermore, uni- and multivariate 
analyses of various prognostic parameters showed the independent impacts of 
baseline performance status (PS) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) on 
PFS2.
CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest the potential of PFS2 as an optimal 
surrogate for OS in advanced UC patients receiving standard sequential systemic 
therapy and indicate that intensive treatment needs to be considered for those 
with poor PS and/or high NLR prior to the introduction of first-line 
chemotherapy."
321,"BACKGROUND Amyloid deposition in the thyroid gland can be primary or secondary 
and can result in goiter. There have been previous reports of amyloid goiter and 
thyroid lipomatosis or fatty infiltration. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the 
most common thyroid malignancy. We report a rare case of a 54-year-old woman 
with papillary thyroid carcinoma associated with secondary amyloid goiter and 
thyroid lipomatosis. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old woman with chronic pyelonephritis 
and bronchiectasis presented with compressive symptoms due to an enlarged 
thyroid gland. Thyroid function test results were in the normal range and serum 
thyroid autoantibodies and serum calcitonin levels were undetectable. Cervical 
ultrasound showed a diffusely swollen thyroid and a well-defined nodule in the 
right lobe, of which fine-needle aspiration cytology was suspicious for 
follicular neoplasm. Computed tomography showed an enlarged thyroid with low 
attenuation, suggestive of diffuse lipomatosis of the gland. Total thyroidectomy 
was performed, and a histopathology study indicated the presence of papillary 
carcinoma and diffuse lipomatosis of the thyroid gland with amyloid deposition. 
The patient was later diagnosed with secondary amyloidosis. CONCLUSIONS The 
presentation of secondary amyloidosis as a diffuse goiter with extensive fatty 
infiltration must be considered in the differential diagnosis of thyroid 
enlargement, especially those with rapid onset, and particularly in patients 
with a history of chronic inflammatory disorders or chronic infections 
predisposing to amyloid deposition. Rarely, differentiated thyroid carcinoma is 
found within an amyloid goiter and it must be excluded in the differential 
diagnosis."
322,"The major predisposing factors of developing oral cancer include smoking, 
alcohol drinking, and betel quid chewing. Betel quid chewing could cause the 
abrasion and damage of oral mucosa by crude fibers, chemical insults by additive 
slaked lime, and arecoline from areca nut. These would lead to the local 
consequence of oral submucosal fibrosis, which is regarded clinically as a 
precancer lesion and a major cause of trismus. In addition, the components and 
additives in betel quid contain chemical toxins and carcinogens, which would 
further affect the oral mucosa and gradually develop a malignancy. Following 
literature review, aside from having a greater total tumor burden and more local 
diseases in the oral cavity and digestive tract, patients with betel 
quid-related oral cancer also have more systemic diseases from metabolic 
syndrome, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes mellitus, and 
obesity than those without this habit. In conclusion, those patients who have 
the history of smoking, alcohol drinking, and betel quid chewing would present 
much more unique clinical characteristics than those who only have a history of 
smoking and alcohol drinking. More attention should therefore be paid to 
pretreatment evaluation, treatment strategy, and posttreatment follow-up among 
betel quid chewers."
323,"BACKGROUND: The Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC) rule was adopted in 1996, 
permitting waiver of informed consent for certain emergency research, including 
trials funded by the United States government. The rule requires prospective 
consent from patients or their Legally Authorized Representative(s) (LAR) if 
practicable. For those enrolled without consent, the patient or their LAR must 
be given an opportunity to opt-out from continued participation at the earliest 
opportunity. We sought to census the trials conducted under the EFIC rule to 
facilitate research to better understand how the rule is being used.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-pronged search to identify all trials conducted 
under the EFIC rule, drawing on reviews, database searches, examination of the 
FDA's docket, posting an inquiry on the IRB Forum, and email requests to lead 
authors of all published EFIC trials and related review articles. We describe 
the trials, when they were started and completed, and whether they were 
terminated early.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 110 trials as of the end of April, 2022: 78 
complete, 13 recruiting, 7 registered on clinicaltrials.gov but not yet 
recruiting, 5 trials that were abandoned before enrolling any subjects, and 7 
trials in early planning. Nine of the 78 completed trials were pilot or 
feasibility trials. Of 69 completed full trials, 30 (43.5%) were terminated 
early. The most common reason for early termination was futility (15 trials, 
25.0%) followed by poor recruitment (10 trials, 14.5%). The rate of conduct of 
trials has been remarkably constant since 2001, with roughly 18 trials started 
in each 5-year period.
CONCLUSIONS: We have compiled a census of trials conducted under the US FDA's 
Exception from Informed Consent rule, the availability of which we hope will 
stimulate further in-depth data collection and analysis of this set of trials."
324,"OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of patients 
with vasoproliferative retinal tumor (VPRT) in India.
METHODS: Retrospective study of 50 eyes in 47 patients.
RESULTS: Of the 50 eyes, 25 (50%) were primary and 25 (50%) were secondary. 
Common ocular pathologies related to secondary VPRT included retinal detachment 
(n = 8, 32%) and Coats disease (n = 7, 28%). Overall, the mean age at 
presentation was 35 years (range; 3-74 years) and included 30 (64%) males and 17 
(36%) females. The lesions were unilateral in 44 (94%) patients. Secondary 
retinal features included intra/subretinal exudation (n = 41, 82%), vascularity 
(n = 32, 64%), subretinal fluid (n = 21, 42%), retinal neovascularisation 
(n = 9, 18%) and vitreous hemorrhage (n = 8, 16%). Thirty-four eyes (68%) 
underwent cryotherapy, of which 16 eyes (47%) received adjunct intravitreal 
anti-VEGF (12 eyes) or corticosteroid injection (4 eyes). Primary surgery 
included vitrectomy with/without encirclage and cryotherapy (n = 12, 24%) and 
plaque brachytherapy (n = 3, 6%). At last follow-up (mean 9.7 months, range 3-67 
months), 42 eyes (84%) had complete tumor regression with no improvement in 
visual outcomes when comparing presenting and final best corrected visual 
acuity. Comparing primary versus secondary VPRT, secondary VPRT presented a 
decade earlier (31 vs 40 years), needed surgical intervention (48% vs 20%), had 
poor tumor control (72% vs 92%) and worse visual outcomes (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: VPRTs commonly present as a unilateral lesions in the adult 
population with equal prevalence of primary and secondary variants. Compared 
with primary VPRT, secondary VPRTs require surgical treatment and are associated 
with poor visual outcome."
325,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicated that obesity would accelerate frailty 
progression. However, obesity is heterogeneous by different metabolic status. 
The associations of metabolic heterogeneity of obesity with frailty progression 
remain unclear.
METHODS: A total of 6730 participants from the China Health and Retirement 
Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) and 4713 from the English Longitudinal Study of 
Ageing (ELSA) were included at baseline. Metabolic heterogeneity of obesity was 
evaluated based on four obesity and metabolic phenotypes as metabolically 
healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), 
metabolically healthy overweight/obesity (MHOO), and metabolically unhealthy 
overweight/obesity (MUOO). Frailty status was assessed by the frailty index (FI) 
ranging from 0 to 100 and frailty was defined as FI ≥ 25. Linear mixed-effect 
models were used to analyse the associations of metabolic heterogeneity of 
obesity with frailty progression.
RESULTS: In the CHARLS, MUOO and MUNW presented the accelerated FI progression 
with additional annual increases of 0.284 (95% CI: 0.155 to 0.413, P < 0.001) 
and 0.169 (95% CI: 0.035 to 0.303, P = 0.013) as compared with MHNW. MHOO 
presented no accelerated FI progression (β: -0.011, 95% CI: -0.196 to 0.173, 
P = 0.904) as compared with MHNW. In the ELSA, the accelerated FI progression 
was marginally significant for MUOO (β: 0.103, 95% CI: -0.005 to 0.210, 
P = 0.061) and MUNW (β: 0.157, 95% CI: -0.011 to 0.324, P = 0.066), but not for 
MHOO (β: -0.047, 95% CI: -0.157 to 0.062, P = 0.396) in comparison with MHNW. 
The associations of MUOO and MUNW with the accelerated FI progression were 
stronger after excluding the baseline frail participants in both cohorts. The 
metabolic status changed over time. When compared with stable MHNW, participants 
who changed from MHNW to MUNW presented the accelerated FI progression with 
additional annual increases of 0.356 (95% CI: 0.113 to 0.599, P = 0.004) and 
0.255 (95% CI: 0.033 to 0.477, P = 0.024) in the CHARLS and ELSA, respectively. 
The accelerated FI progression was also found in MHOO participants who 
transitioned to MUOO (CHARLS, β: 0.358, 95% CI: 0.053 to 0.663, P = 0.022; ELSA, 
β: 0.210, 95% CI: 0.049 to 0.370, P = 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: Metabolically unhealthy overweight/obesity and normal weight, but 
not metabolically healthy overweight/obesity, accelerated frailty progression as 
compared with metabolically healthy normal weight. Regardless of obesity status, 
transitions from healthy metabolic status to unhealthy metabolic status 
accelerated frailty progression as compared with stable metabolically healthy 
normal weight. Our findings highlight the important role of metabolic status in 
frailty progression and recommend the stratified management of obesity based on 
metabolic status."

motion (maximal motion >1 cm) were compared with those in nodules with small 
motion (≤1 cm).
RESULTS: The mean maximal and average respiratory motions between tidal volume 
breathing were 5.4 ± 4.4 and 2.7 ± 2.6 mm, respectively. Sensitivity and 
accuracy were 93.1% and 96.1% in nodules with large motion, compared with 94.7% 
and 95.9% in nodules with small motion, respectively. Respiratory targeting 
(P < 0.001), needle modulation (P < 0.001), motion artifact of target 
(P < 0.001), target disappearance from scans (P < 0.001), and number of 
performed CT scans (P < 0.001) were significantly higher in the large motion 
group, with no significant difference in radiation dose and complications 
between the groups.
CONCLUSION: The respiratory motion of pulmonary nodules during CT-guided PTNB 
may cause technical difficulties but does not affect diagnostic performance nor 
complications associated with PTNB."
327,"BACKGROUND: The burden perceived by the patient of repeated imaging required for 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) monitoring warrants attention due to the 
increased use of NAC and imaging.
PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the experienced burden associated with repeated 
contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during 
NAC for breast cancer from the patient perspective.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Approval from the ethics committee and written informed 
consent were obtained. In this prospective study, CEM and MRI were performed on 
38 patients with breast cancer before, during, and after NAC in a tertiary 
cancer center. The experienced burden was evaluated with a self-reported 
questionnaire addressing duration, comfort, anxiety, positioning, and 
intravenous contrast administration, each measured on a 5-point Likert scale. 
The participants were asked their preference between CEM or MRI. Statistical 
comparisons were performed and P<0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Most participants (n = 29, 76%) preferred CEM over MRI (P = 0.0008). 
CEM was associated with a significantly shorter duration (P < 0.001), greater 
overall comfort (P < 0.01), more comfortable positioning (P = 0.01), and lower 
anxiety (P = 0.03). Intravenous contrast administration perception revealed no 
significant difference. Only 4 (10%) participants preferred MRI over CEM, due to 
the absence of breast compression.
CONCLUSION: In the hypothetical scenario of equal diagnostic accuracy, most 
participants preferred CEM and compared CEM favorably to MRI in all investigated 
features at repeated imaging required for NAC response assessment. Our results 
indicate that repeated examinations with CEM is well tolerated and constitutes a 
patient-friendly alternative for NAC imaging monitoring in breast cancer."
328,"Identifying cancer type-specific driver mutations is crucial for illuminating 
distinct pathologic mechanisms across various tumors and providing opportunities 
of patient-specific treatment. However, although many computational methods were 
developed to predict driver mutations in a type-specific manner, the methods 
still have room to improve. Here, we devise a novel feature based on sequence 
co-evolution analysis to identify cancer type-specific driver mutations and 
construct a machine learning (ML) model with state-of-the-art performance. 
Specifically, relying on 28 000 tumor samples across 66 cancer types, our ML 
framework outperformed current leading methods of detecting cancer driver 
mutations. Interestingly, the cancer mutations identified by sequence 
co-evolution feature are frequently observed in interfaces mediating 
tissue-specific protein-protein interactions that are known to associate with 
shaping tissue-specific oncogenesis. Moreover, we provide pre-calculated 
potential oncogenicity on available human proteins with prediction scores of all 
possible residue alterations through user-friendly website 
(http://sbi.postech.ac.kr/w/cancerCE). This work will facilitate the 
identification of cancer type-specific driver mutations in newly sequenced tumor 
samples."
329,"Long noncoding ribonucleic acids (RNAs; LncRNAs) endowed with both 
protein-coding and noncoding functions are referred to as 'dual functional 
lncRNAs'. Recently, dual functional lncRNAs have been intensively studied and 
identified as involved in various fundamental cellular processes. However, apart 
from time-consuming and cell-type-specific experiments, there is virtually no in 
silico method for predicting the identity of dual functional lncRNAs. Here, we 
developed a deep-learning model with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, 
LncReader, to identify dual functional lncRNAs. Our data demonstrated that 
LncReader showed multiple advantages compared to various classical machine 
learning methods using benchmark datasets from our previously reported cncRNAdb 
project. Moreover, to obtain independent in-house datasets for robust testing, 
mass spectrometry proteomics combined with RNA-seq and Ribo-seq were applied in 
four leukaemia cell lines, which further confirmed that LncReader achieved the 
best performance compared to other tools. Therefore, LncReader provides an 
accurate and practical tool that enables fast dual functional lncRNA 
identification."
330,"BACKGROUND: Duodenal margin positivity is a poor prognostic factor following 
gastrectomy for resectable gastric cancer. Intraoperative frozen section (IFS) 
analysis allows radical resection to be achieved in a single operation but is 
time- and resource-consuming. Hence resection is usually performed based on 
surgeon's judgment and palpation.
AIM OF STUDY: To determine risk factors for duodenal resection margin (RM) 
positivity following gastrectomy for resectable gastric cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed prospectively maintained data 
of 376 patients admitted with diagnosis of gastric cancer from August 2011 to 
January 2020 in JIPMER, a tertiary center in Puducherry, India. Of these, 146 
patients underwent gastric resection with curative intent and were the subject 
of this study. RM status was assessed by definitive histopathology examination. 
The potential risk factors were compared between patients with positive margin 
on definitive histopathology examination and a control cohort of similar 
patients with negative margins.
RESULTS: Of the 146 patients, 16 patients (10.9%), 11 men and 5 women, had 
positive duodenal margin. The mean age of study group was 59 years. None of the 
patient characteristics like age, sex, comorbidities, or addictions were 
statistically significant with regard to duodenal margin positivity. Among tumor 
characteristics, locally advanced tumors and pyloroantral tumors were found more 
frequently in the margin-positive group. High-risk features for duodenal margin 
positivity were extensive nodal disease, oligometastatic disease, lymphovascular 
invasion, and perineural invasion. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and types of 
surgical access did not have significant impact on RM. Interestingly, both 
proximal and circumferential resection margin positivity had a linear 
association with distal margin positivity suggesting that tumor biology may have 
a significant role in margin positivity. However, none of these factors were 
statistically significant on multivariate analysis using logistic regression 
model. Among oligometastatic patients, survival was dependent on R0 resection 
and was not different from patients without metastases though our study was not 
powered for survival analysis (mean survival of 11.040 months) and expectedly, 
duodenal margin positive patients had lower overall survival compared to margin 
negative patients (mean survival of 5.188 vs. 11.763 months, p = 0.12).
CONCLUSIONS: Locally advanced tumors and pyloroantral tumors are associated with 
an increased risk of duodenal margin positivity after gastrectomy for carcinoma 
stomach and may benefit from intraoperative frozen section analysis as survival 
is negatively affected by positive RM. Patients with high-risk features like 
extensive nodal and oligometastatic disease have a greater propensity for 
positive duodenal margin. A prospective study with a large sample size is needed 
to further validate these results."
331,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of fusidic acid (FA) on human cervical, 
thyroid, and breast carcinoma cell lines to determine the potential usefulness 
of FA in cancer treatment.
METHODS: Six cancer cell lines (cervical cancer: Caski, HeLa; thyroid cancer: 
8505C, TPC1; and breast cancer: MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) were treated with FA. 
Furthermore the changes in cell growth, cell cycle duration, and extent of 
apoptosis were analyzed.
RESULTS: After FA treatment, the cancer cells showed a decrease in growth rate. 
In the cell death assay, the cell populations were similar in each cell type 
after treatment with FA, indicating that growth inhibition by FA was not related 
to the induction of apoptosis. FA induced cell cycle arrest at a dose that 
inhibited growth rate, which varied in different cell types. G0/G1 phase arrest 
occurs in breast cancer, S phase arrest in 8505C thyroid cancer, and G2/M phase 
arrest in cervical cancer. These results indicate that FA reduces growth rates 
by inducing cell cycle arrest.
CONCLUSION: FA treatment can interfere with cell proliferation by inducing cell 
cycle arrest in human cervical, thyroid, and breast carcinoma cell lines. Thus, 
FA can be useful in treating human cervical, thyroid, and breast carcinomas."
332,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the performance of diffusion-relaxation correlation 
spectrum imaging (DR-CSI) with support vector machine (SVM) in detecting 
prostate cancer (PCa).
METHODS: In total, 114 patients (mean age, 66 years, range, 48-87 years) who 
received a prostate MRI and underwent biopsy were enrolled in three stages. 
Thirty-nine were assigned for the exploration stage to establish the model, 18 
for the validation stage to choose the appropriate scale for mapping and 57 for 
the test stage to compare the diagnostic performance of the DR-CSI and PI-RADS.
RESULTS: In the exploration stage, the DR-CSI model was established and 
performed better than the ADC and T2 values (both P < 0.001). The validation 
result shows that at least 2 pixels were required for both the long-axis and 
short-axis in the mapping procedure. In the test stage, DR-CSI had higher 
accuracy than PI-RADS ≥ 3 as a positive finding based on patient (84.2% vs. 
63.2%, P = 0.004) and lesion (78.8% vs. 57.6%, P = 0.001) as well as PI-RADS ≥ 4 
on lesion (76.5% vs. 64.7%, P = 0.029), while there was no significant 
difference between DR-CSI and PI-RADS ≥ 4 based on patient (P = 0.508). For 
clinically significant PCa, DR-CSI had higher accuracy than PI-RADS ≥ 3 based on 
patients (84.2% vs. 63.2%, P = 0.004) and lesions (62.4% vs. 48.2%, P = 0.036). 
There was no significant difference between DR-CSI and PI-RADS ≥ 4 (P = 1.000 
and 0.845 for the patient and lesion levels, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: DR-CSI combined with the SVM model may improve the diagnostic 
accuracy of PCa.

333,"BACKGROUND: Facial mutilation and deformities can be caused by cancer, tumours, 
injuries, infections, and inherited or acquired deformities and has the 
potential to degrade one's quality of life by interfering with fundamental tasks 
like communication, breathing, feeding, and aesthetics. Depending on the type of 
defect, producing maxillofacial prostheses for the rehabilitation of patients 
with various defects can be challenging and complex. The prosthesis is used to 
replace missing or damaged parts of the cranium and face, like the nose, 
auricle, orbit, and surrounding tissues, as well as missing areas of soft and 
hard tissue, with the primary goal of increasing the patient's quality of life 
by rehabilitating oral functions such as speech, swallowing, and mastication. 
Traditional maxillofacial prosthesis impression and fabrication processes 
include a number of complicated steps that are costly, time-consuming, and 
uncomfortable for the patient. These rely on the knowledge of the maxillofacial 
team, dental clinicians, and maxillofacial technician. The foundation of the 
impression is the keystone for creating a prosthesis. However, this is the most 
time-consuming and difficult chair-side operation in maxillofacial prosthesis 
manufacturing since it requires prolonged interaction with the patient. The 
field of prosthesis fabrication is being transformed by the digital revolution. 
Digital technology allows for more accurate impression data to be gathered in 
less time (3 to 5 min) than traditional methods, lowering patient anxiety. 
Digital impressions eliminate the need for messy impression materials and 
provide patients with a more pleasant experience. This method bypasses the 
procedure of traditional gypsum model fabrication. This eliminates the disparity 
caused by a dimensional distortion of the impression material and gypsum setting 
expansion. Traditional dental impression processes leave enough room for errors, 
such as voids or flaws, air bubbles, or deformities, while current technology 
for prosthesis planning has emerged as an alternative means to improve patient 
acceptability and pleasure, not only because the end result is a precisely 
fitted restoration but also because the chair-side adjustments required are 
reduced. The most frequent approaches for creating 3D virtual models are the 
following. To begin, 3D scanning is employed, in which the subjects are scanned 
in three dimensions, and the point cloud data is used to create a virtual 
digital model.
METHODS: It will be a hospital-based randomised control trial, carried out at 
the Department of Prosthodontics, Sharad Pawar Dental College, Sawangi (Meghe), 
Wardha, a part of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences (Deemed University). 
A total of 45 patients will be selected from the outpatient department (OPD) of 
the Department of Prosthodontics. All the patients will be provided written 
consent before their participation in the study.
METHODOLOGY: 1. Patient screening will be done, and the patient will be 
allocated to three techniques that are the conventional manual method, 
photogrammetry method, and 3D scanning in a randomised manner 2. The impression 
of the defect will be recorded by conventional manual method, photogrammetry 
method, and 3D scanning 3. The defect will be modelled in three ways: first is 
as per the manual dimension taken on the patient, second is the organisation of 
photographic image taken with lab standards and third is plotting of point cloud 
data to generate the virtual 3D model 4. For photogrammetric prosthesis design, 
finite photos/images will be taken at multiple angles to model the 3D virtual 
design. With the use of minimum photographs, the 3D modelling can be performed 
by using freeware, and a mould is obtained 5. The CAD software was used to 
design the prosthesis, and the final negative mould can be printed using 
additive manufacturing 6. The mould fabricated by all three methods will be 
analysed by a software using reverse engineering technology Study design: 
Randomised control trial Duration: 2 years Sample size: 45 patients DISCUSSION: 
Rodrigo Salazar-Gamarra1, Rosemary Seelaus, and Jorge Vicente Lopes da Silva et 
al., in the year 2016, discussed, as part of a method for manufacturing face 
prostheses utilising a mobile device, free software, and a photo capture 
protocol, that 2D captures of the anatomy of a patient with a facial defect were 
converted into a 3D model using monoscopic photogrammetry and a mobile device. 
The visual and technical integrity of the resulting digital models was assessed. 
The technological approach and models that resulted were thoroughly explained 
and evaluated for technical and clinical value. Marta Revilla-León, Wael Att, 
and Dr Med Dent et al. (2020) used a coordinate measuring equipment which was 
used to assess the accuracy of complete arch implant impression processes 
utilising conventional, photogrammetry, and intraoral scanning. Corina Marilena 
Cristache and Ioana Tudor Liliana Moraru et al. in the year 2021 provided an 
update on defect data acquisition, editing, and design using open-source and 
commercially available software in digital workflow in maxillofacial 
prosthodontics. This research looked at randomised clinical trials, case 
reports, case series, technical comments, letters to the editor, and reviews 
involving humans that were written in English and included detailed information 
on data acquisition, data processing software, and maxillofacial prosthetic part 
design.

334,"The treatment landscape of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) has undergone 
significant changes over the past 20 years. Gradual improvements have been made 
in the management of cHL patients, particularly in prolonging the survival rate 
for those in the relapsed setting. Most of these improvements came with the 
addition of brentuximab vedotin and PD1 blockade (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) 
into the current cHL treatment algorithms. On the other hand, the treatment 
approach to cHL has become more complex than ever before, with multiple ways to 
add and sequence therapies to achieve long-term remission. In this review, we 
will discuss the most up-to-date evidence on the management of cHL patients with 
the inclusion of ongoing clinical trials in cHL. We will provide a general 
overview of the current therapeutic landscape of cHL in light of these most 
recent data. We conclude with our perspective on how the approach to cHL 
treatment may evolve in the future."
335,"BACKGROUND: Identifying breast cancer risk factors is a critical component of 
preventative strategies for this disease. This study aims to identify modifiable 
and non-modifiable risk factors of breast cancer in Iranian women.
METHODS: We used international databases (PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of 
Knowledge, and Embase) and national databases (SID, Magiran, and ISC) to 
retrieve relevant studies until November 13, 2022. The odds ratio (OR) with a 
95% confidence interval using the random-effect model was used to estimate the 
pooled effect. The publication bias was assessed by the Egger and Begg test. A 
sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of each included study 
on the final measurement.
RESULTS: Of the 30,351 retrieved articles, 24 matched case-control records were 
included with 12,460 participants (5675 newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer 
and 6785 control). This meta-analysis showed that of the known modifiable risk 
factors for breast cancer, obesity (vs normal weight) had the highest risk 
(OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.21; I2 = 85.7) followed by age at marriage (25-29 
vs < 18 years old) (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.61; I2 = 0), second-hand smoking 
(OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.19; I2 = 0), smoking (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.41 to 
2.38; I2 = 18.9), abortion history (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.05; I2 = 66.3), 
oral contraceptive use (OR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.63; I2 = 74.1), age at 
marriage (18-24 vs < 18 years old) (OR: 1.22, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.47; I2 = 0). Of 
non-modifiable risk factors, history of radiation exposure (OR = 3.48, 95% CI 
2.17 to 5.59; I2 = 0), family history of breast cancer (OR = 2.47, 95% CI 1.83 
to 3.33; I2 = 73), and age at menarche (12-13 vs ≥ 14 years old) (OR = 1.67, 95% 
CI 1.31-2.13; I2 = 25.4) significantly increased the risk of breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Since most risk factors related to breast cancer incidence are 
modifiable, promoting healthy lifestyles can play an influential role in 
preventing breast cancer. In women with younger menarche age, a family history 
of breast cancer, or a history of radiation exposure, screening at short 
intervals is recommended."
336,"BACKGROUND: Risk of contralateral nodal metastases in oropharyngeal squamous 
cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is relatively low, however, many OPSCC patients receive 
bilateral neck treatment. This study evaluates the oncological outcomes with 
management of the contralateral cN0 neck based on lymphatic mapping with single 
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT).
METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of patients with lateralized cT1-2 and 
contralateral cN0 OPSCC treated with primary surgery between December 2017 and 
October 2019. All patients underwent pre-operative lymphatic mapping using 
SPECT-CT. Clinical parameters including demographics, tumor characteristics and 
oncological outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent primary site resection with transoral 
robotic surgery (TORS) and ipsilateral neck dissection with or without adjuvant 
therapy. Twelve patients (92.3%) had ipsilateral drainage on SPECT-CT, whereas 1 
(7.7%) patient had bilateral neck lymphatic drainage. Four patients (30.8%) 
underwent post-operative radiation therapy (PORT). Three patients with 
unilateral drainage on SPECT-CT underwent PORT with unilateral neck irradiation, 
and 1 patient with bilateral drainage underwent PORT with bilateral neck 
irradiation. Seven (53.8%) patients were staged as pT1, 6 (46.2%) patients as 
pT2, 6 (46.2%) patients were pN0, 3 (23.1%) patients were pN1, 1 (7.7%) patient 
was pN2a for and 3 (23.1%) patients were N2b. The median distance of the tumor 
from midline was 1.05 cm (0.0-1.58). Primary sites included tonsil (n = 10, 
76.9%) and tongue base (n = 3, 23.1%). The median follow-up time was 
15.4 months. All patients were disease free at the latest follow-up with no 
contralateral neck failures.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative mapping of lymphatic drainage in early stage OPSCC 
with SPECT-CT is a promising tool which can reduce treatment to the 
contralateral neck potentially without compromising oncological outcomes."
337,"BACKGROUND: The interest in non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery 
(NIVATS) has risen over the last decade and numerous terms have been used to 
describe this technique. They all have in common, that the surgical procedure is 
performed in a spontaneously breathing patient under locoregional anaesthesia in 
combination with intravenous sedation but have also been performed on awake 
patients without sedation. Evidence has been generated favouring NIVATS compared 
to one-lung-ventilation under general anaesthesia.
MAIN BODY: We want to give an overview of how NIVATS is performed, and which 
different techniques are possible. We discuss advantages such as shorter length 
of hospital stay or (relative) contraindications like airway difficulties. 
Technical aspects, for instance intraoperative handling of the vagus nerve, are 
considered from a thoracic surgeon's point of view. Furthermore, special 
attention is paid to the cohort of patients with interstitial lung diseases, who 
seem to benefit from NIVATS due to the avoidance of positive pressure 
ventilation. Whenever a new technique is introduced, it must prove 
noninferiority to the state of the art. Under this aspect current literature on 
NIVATS for lung cancer surgery has been reviewed.
CONCLUSION: NIVATS technique may safely be applied to minor, moderate, and major 
thoracic procedures and is appropriate for a selected group of patients, 
especially in interstitial lung disease. However, prospective studies are 
urgently needed."
338,"BACKGROUND: True hermaphroditism is a rare condition. It is defined as the 
presence of both testicular and ovarian tissues in the same individual. Sex cord 
tumour with annular tubules (SCTAT) is a rare stromal tumour of the sex cord 
that occurs mostly in the ovaries.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old girl presented to the gynaecology department 
with primary amenorrhea. Gynaecological examination revealed an enlarged 
clitoris that looked like a small penis. The chromosome karyotype was chimaera. 
The postoperative pathology confirmed true hermaphroditism with SCTAT. The 
patient underwent hormonal replacement after an operation and had no evidence of 
recurrence for 6 months.
CONCLUSION: Cases of true hermaphroditism with SCTAT are extremely rare 
conditions. Surgery and hormonal replacement are important for improving the 
prognosis of such patients."
339,"BACKGROUND: Pyrotinib (an irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor) plus capecitabine has 
survival benefits and acceptable tolerability in patients with HER2-positive 
metastatic breast cancer. We further assessed addition of pyrotinib to 
trastuzumab and docetaxel in the neoadjuvant setting.
METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 study (PHEDRA), 
treatment-naive women with HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer 
were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive four neoadjuvant cycles of oral 
pyrotinib or placebo (400 mg) once daily, plus intravenous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg 
loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg) and docetaxel (100 mg/m2) every 3 weeks. The 
primary endpoint was the total pathological complete response (tpCR; ypT0/is and 
ypN0) rate per independent central review.
RESULTS: Between Jul 23, 2018, and Jan 8, 2021, 355 patients were randomly 
assigned, 178 to the pyrotinib group and 177 to the placebo group. The majority 
of patients completed four cycles of neoadjuvant treatment as planned (92.7% and 
97.7% in the pyrotinib and placebo groups, respectively). The tpCR rate was 
41.0% (95% CI 34.0 to 48.4) in the pyrotinib group compared with 22.0% (95% CI 
16.6 to 28.7) in the placebo group (difference, 19.0% [95% CI 9.5 to 28.4]; 
one-sided P < 0.0001). The objective response rate per investigator was 91.6% 
(95% CI 86.6 to 94.8) in the pyrotinib group and 81.9% (95% CI 75.6 to 86.9) in 
the placebo group after the neoadjuvant treatment, resulting in an increase of 
9.7% (95% CI 2.7 to 16.6). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were 
diarrhea (79 [44.4%] in the pyrotinib group and nine [5.1%] in the placebo 
group), neutropenia (33 [18.5%] and 36 [20.3%]), and decreased white blood cell 
count (29 [16.3%] and 24 [13.6%]). No deaths were reported during neoadjuvant 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint of the study was met. Neoadjuvant pyrotinib, 
trastuzumab, and docetaxel significantly improved the tpCR rate compared with 
placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel, with manageable toxicity, providing a new 
option for HER2-positive early or locally advanced breast cancer.

340,"BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) 
remains unclear. IgG4-RD often mimics other diseases, including pancreatic 
cancer (PC) and Sjogren's syndrome (SS), which may easily lead to misdiagnosis. 
This study was performed to explore the metabolite changes and potential 
biomarkers of IgG4-RD and other misdiagnosed diseases.
METHODS: Untargeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics 
profiling of plasma samples from a cohort comprising healthy controls (HCs) and 
patients with IgG4-RD (n = 87), PC (n = 33), and SS (n = 31) was performed. A 
random forest machine learning model was used to verify the relevance of the 
identified metabolites in the diagnosis of different diseases and the prediction 
of disease prognosis.
RESULTS: The ATP-binding cassette transporter pathway was found to be most 
closely related to IgG4-RD, which was significantly up-regulated in the IgG4-RD 
group than in all the matched groups. Five metabolites were proved to be 
valuable biomarkers for IgG4-RD. Caftaric acid, maltotetraose, D-glutamic acid, 
1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine, and hydroxyproline were 
useful in distinguishing between IgG4-RD, PC, SS, and HC [area under the curve 
(AUC) = 1]. A combination of phenylalanine betaine, 
1-(1z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, Pi 40:8, uracil, and 
N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide showed a moderate value in predicting relapse 
in patients with IgG4-RD (AUC = 0.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the metabolite changes of IgG4-RD and provide 
new insights for deepening our understanding of IgG4-RD despite the lack of 
validation in external cohorts. Metabolomic biomarkers have significance in the 
clinical diagnosis and disease prognosis of IgG4-RD."
341,"BACKGROUND: Early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is 
important to aid personalized treatment in osteosarcoma. Diffusion-weighted 
Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) MRI was used to evaluate the predictive 
value for response to NACT and survival outcome in osteosarcoma.
METHODS: Total fifty-five patients with biopsy-proven osteosarcoma were 
recruited prospectively, among them 35 patients were further analysed. Patients 
underwent 3 cycles of NACT (Cisplatin + Doxorubicin) followed by surgery and 
response adapted adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment outcomes were 
histopathological response to NACT (good-response ≥ 50% necrosis and 
poor-response < 50% necrosis) and survival outcome (event-free survival (EFS) 
and overall survival (OS)). IVIM MRI was acquired at 1.5T at baseline (t0), 
after 1-cycle (t1) and after 3-cycles (t2) of NACT. Quantitative IVIM parameters 
(D, D*, f & D*.f) were estimated using advanced state-of-the-art spatial penalty 
based IVIM analysis method bi-exponential model with total-variation penalty 
function (BETV) at 3 time-points and histogram analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Good-responders: Poor-responders ratio was 13 (37%):22 (63%). EFS and 
OS were 31% and 69% with 16.27 and 25.9 months of median duration respectively. 
For predicting poor-response to NACT, IVIM parameters showed AUC = 0.87, 
Sensitivity = 86%, Specificity = 77% at t0, and AUC = 0.96, Sensitivity = 86%, 
Specificity = 100% at t1. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed smaller 
tumour volume (HR = 1.002, p = 0.001) higher ADC-25th-percentile (HR = 0.047, 
p = 0.005) & D-Mean (HR = 0.1, p = 0.023) and lower D*-Mean (HR = 1.052, 
p = 0.039) were independent predictors of longer EFS (log-rank p-values: 0.054, 
0.0034, 0.0017, 0.0019 respectively) and non-metastatic disease (HR = 4.33, 
p < 10-3), smaller tumour-volume (HR = 1.001, p = 0.042), lower D*-Mean 
(HR = 1.045, p = 0.056) and higher D*.f-skewness (HR = 0.544, p = 0.048) were 
independent predictors of longer OS (log-rank p-values: < 10-3, 0.07, < 10-3, 
0.019 respectively).
CONCLUSION: IVIM parameters obtained with a 1.5T scanner along with novel BETV 
method and their histogram analysis indicating tumour heterogeneity were 
informative in characterizing NACT response and survival outcome in 
osteosarcoma."
342,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer has been a serious public health dilemma for women 
worldwide, with not only physical and social impairments but also psychological 
stress responses such as rumination. Rumination is a constant preoccupation with 
thoughts. The present study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of 
mindfulness-based stress reduction training in lowering rumination among women 
diagnosed with breast cancer.
METHOD: This randomized controlled trial with a pretest, posttest, control 
group, and one-month follow-up design included 46 female breast cancer 
survivors, recruited from the clinics and hematology wards of Bushehr, Iran. The 
inclusion criterion was that at least three months should have passed since the 
last chemotherapy/radiotherapy. The participants were randomly assigned to two 
experimental and control groups. The experimental group received eight sessions 
of mindfulness-based stress reduction training. A demographic information form 
and a rumination questionnaire were used for data collection, and the 
participants completed the questionnaire in the pretest, posttest, and follow-up 
stages. Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and repeated-measures ANOVA were used to 
analyze the data. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the rumination scores of the 
experimental group at three measurement stages. For the control group, the mean 
rumination scores on the posttest and follow-up were both significantly higher 
than on the pre-test (P < 0.001). The control group's mean follow-up rumination 
score was significantly higher than that of the post-test (P = 0.02). A 
comparison of the two groups adjusted for the baseline showed a significant 
difference between them in terms of the mean rumination score on the post-test 
(P = 0.01) and follow-up (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The experimental group was more successful in avoiding increased 
rumination than the control group, an ability that can be attributed to the 
effect of mindfulness training. The use of this method is recommended because it 
is non-invasive, non-pharmacological, free from complications, and can be easily 
performed by women. However, future studies should consider larger samples and 
long-term follow-ups."
343,"PURPOSE: To construct machine learning models for predicting progression free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
(ESCC) patients.
METHODS: 204 ESCC patients were randomly divided into training cohort (n = 143) 
and test cohort (n = 61) according to the ratio of 7:3. Two radiomics models 
were constructed by radiomics features, which were selected by LASSO Cox model 
to predict PFS and OS, respectively. Clinical features were selected by 
univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model (p < 0.05). Combined 
radiomics and clinical model was developed by selected clinical and radiomics 
features. The receiver operating characteristic curve, Kaplan Meier curve and 
nomogram were used to display the capability of constructed models.
RESULTS: There were 944 radiomics features extracted based on volume of interest 
in CT images. There were six radiomics features and seven clinical features for 
PFS prediction and three radiomics features and three clinical features for OS 
prediction; The radiomics models showed general performance in training cohort 
and test cohort for prediction for prediction PFS (AUC, 0.664, 0.676. C-index, 
0.65, 0.64) and OS (AUC, 0.634, 0.646.C-index, 0.64, 0.65). The combined models 
displayed high performance in training cohort and test cohort for prediction PFS 
(AUC, 0.856, 0.833. C-index, 0.81, 0.79) and OS (AUC, 0.742, 0.768. C-index, 
0.72, 0.71).
CONCLUSION: We developed combined radiomics and clinical machine learning models 
with better performance than radiomics or clinical alone, which were used to 
accurate predict 3 years PFS and OS of non-surgical ESCC patients. The 
prediction results could provide a reference for clinical decision."
344,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is facing the 
dilemma of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) resistance and disease recurrence. 
The dysfunctional DNA damage repair mechanism plays an essential role not only 
in the initiation and progression of hematological malignancies but also links 
to the development of TKI resistance. Deciphering the abnormally regulated DNA 
damage repair and proteins involved brings new insights into the therapy of 
leukemias. As a G2/M phase checkpoint kinase and a DNA damage repair checkpoint 
kinase engaged in the DNA damage response (DDR), along with an oncogenic driver 
present in various cancers, the particular involvement of Wee1 in DNA damage is 
far from clear. Deciphering its function and targeting it via modulating DNA 
repair pathways is important for improving our understanding of cancer 
treatment.
METHODS: Wee1 expression was assessed in cell lines using RT-qPCR and western 
blot, and Wee1 knockdown efficacy was validated using RT-qPCR, western blot, and 
immunofluorescence. Wee1 function was investigated by CCK-8, colony formation, 
and flow cytometry assay in vitro. Wee1 role in DNA repair and its interactions 
with other proteins were then studied using western blot, immunofluorescence, 
and double plasmid-repair studies. Finally, the CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay 
was utilized to investigate Wee1 and imatinib's synergistic effect, and a CML 
mouse model was constructed to study Wee1's role in carcinogenesis in vivo.
RESULTS: Wee1 was reported to respond quickly to DDR in an 
ATM-γH2AX-MDC1-dependent way upon DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occurrence, 
and it regulated homologous recombination by stimulating the recruitment of 
critical proteins RAD51/BRCA1 upon DSB sites. Wee1 was also revealed to be 
abnormally upregulated in CML cells. Further suppression of Wee1 not only causes 
cell cycle arrest and inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells but also 
enhances CML cell sensitivity to Imatinib in vitro and in vivo, possibly through 
an excessive accumulation of overall DSBs.
CONCLUSION: Wee1 is extensively involved in the DRR signaling and DSB repair 
pathway. Inhibiting abnormally elevated Wee1 benefits CML therapy in both 
IM-resistant and IM-sensitive cells. Our data demonstrated that Wee1 
participated in promoting cell proliferation and imatinib resistance in chronic 
myeloid leukemia via regulating DNA damage repair dependent on ATM-γH2AX-MDC1. 
In the fight against CML, Wee1's dysregulation in the DNA damage repair 
mechanism of CML pathogenesis makes it a viable therapeutic target in clinical 
applications."
345,"BACKGROUND: To find semi-quantitative and quantitative Positron Emission 
Tomography/Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR) imaging metrics of both tumor and 
non-malignant lymphoid tissue (bone marrow and spleen) for Progression Free 
Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) prediction in patients with 
relapsed/refractory (r/r) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) undergoing Chimeric 
Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy.
METHODS: A single-center prospective study of 16 r/r LBCL patients undergoing 
CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy. Whole body 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/MR 
imaging pre-therapy and 3 weeks post-therapy were followed by manual 
segmentation of tumors and lymphoid tissues. Semi-quantitative and quantitative 
metrics were extracted, and the metric-wise rate of change (Δ) between 
post-therapy and pre-therapy calculated. Tumor metrics included maximum 
Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax), mean SUV (SUVmean), Metabolic Tumor Volume 
(MTV), Tumor Lesion Glycolysis (TLG), structural volume (V), total structural 
tumor burden (Vtotal) and mean Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADCmean). For 
lymphoid tissues, metrics extracted were SUVmean, mean Fat Fraction (FFmean) and 
ADCmean for bone marrow, and SUVmean, V and ADCmean for spleen. Univariate Cox 
regression analysis tested the relationship between extracted metrics and PFS 
and OS. Survival curves were produced using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared 
using the log-rank test, with the median used for dichotomization. Uncorrected 
p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Correction for 
multiple comparisons was performed, with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.05 
considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Pre-therapy (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05) and Δ (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.05) total 
tumor burden structural and metabolic metrics were associated with PFS and/or 
OS. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, a longer PFS was reached for patients 
with pre-therapy MTV ≤ 39.5 ml, ΔMTV≤1.35 and ΔTLG≤1.35. ΔSUVmax was associated 
with PFS (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.05), while ΔADCmean was associated with both PFS and 
OS (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.05). ΔADCmean > 0.92 gave longer PFS and OS in the 
Kaplan-Meier analysis. Pre-therapy bone marrow SUVmean was associated with PFS 
(p < 0.05, FDR < 0.05) and OS (p < 0.05, FDR > 0.05). For bone marrow FDG 
uptake, patient stratification was possible pre-therapy (SUVmean ≤ 1.8).
CONCLUSIONS: MTV, tumor ADCmean and FDG uptake in bone marrow unaffected by 
tumor infiltration are possible PET/MR parameters for prediction of PFS and OS 
in r/r LBCL treated with CAR T-cells.

346,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in treatment, patients with refractory colorectal 
cancer (CRC) still have poor long-term survival, so there is a need for more 
effective therapeutic options.
METHODS: To evaluate the HDAC8 inhibition efficacy as a CRC treatment, we 
examined the effects of various HDAC8 inhibitors (HDAC8i), including BMX 
(NBM-T-L-BMX-OS01) in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) or other standard CRC 
drugs on p53 mutated HT29 cells, as well as wild-type p53 HCT116 and RKO cells.
RESULTS: We showed that HDAC8i with TMZ cotreatment resulted in HT29 arrest in 
the S and G2/M phase, whereas HCT116 and RKO arrest in the G0/G1 phase was 
accompanied by high sub-G1. Subsequently, this combination approach upregulated 
p53-mediated MGMT inhibition, leading to apoptosis. Furthermore, we observed the 
cotreatment also enabled triggering of cell senescence and decreased expression 
of stem cell biomarkers. Mechanistically, we found down-expression levels of 
β-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc via GSK3β/β-catenin signaling. Intriguingly, 
autophagy also contributes to cell death under the opposite status of 
β-catenin/p62 axis, suggesting that there exists a negative feedback regulation 
between Wnt/β-catenin and autophagy. Consistently, the Gene Set Enrichment 
Analysis (GSEA) indicated both apoptotic and autophagy biomarkers in HT29 and 
RKO were upregulated after treating with BMX.
CONCLUSIONS: BMX may act as a HDAC8 eraser and in combination with reframed-TMZ 
generates a remarkable synergic effect, providing a novel therapeutic target for 
various CRCs. Video Abstract."
347,"Cellular senescence is a state of stable cell-cycle arrest with secretory 
features in response to cellular stress. Historically, it has been considered as 
an endogenous evolutionary homeostatic mechanism to eliminate damaged cells, 
including damaged cells which are at risk of malignant transformation, thereby 
protecting against cancer. However, accumulation of senescent cells can cause 
long-term detrimental effects, mainly through the senescence-associated 
secretory phenotype, and paradoxically contribute to age-related diseases 
including cancer. Besides its role as tumor suppressor, cellular senescence is 
increasingly being recognized as an in vivo response in cancer patients to 
various anticancer therapies. Its role in cancer is ambiguous and even 
controversial, and senescence has recently been promoted as an emerging hallmark 
of cancer because of its hallmark-promoting capabilities. In addition, the 
prognostic implications of cellular senescence have been underappreciated due to 
the challenging detection and sparse in and ex vivo evidence of cellular 
senescence in cancer patients, which is only now catching up. In this review, we 
highlight the approaches and current challenges of in and ex vivo detection of 
cellular senescence in cancer patients, and we discuss the prognostic 
implications of cellular senescence based on in and ex vivo evidence in cancer 
patients."
348,"BACKGROUND: Genetic variants within nearly 1000 loci are known to contribute to 
modulation of blood lipid levels. However, the biological pathways underlying 
these associations are frequently unknown, limiting understanding of these 
findings and hindering downstream translational efforts such as drug target 
discovery.
RESULTS: To expand our understanding of the underlying biological pathways and 
mechanisms controlling blood lipid levels, we leverage a large multi-ancestry 
meta-analysis (N = 1,654,960) of blood lipids to prioritize putative causal 
genes for 2286 lipid associations using six gene prediction approaches. Using 
phenome-wide association (PheWAS) scans, we identify relationships of 
genetically predicted lipid levels to other diseases and conditions. We confirm 
known pleiotropic associations with cardiovascular phenotypes and determine 
novel associations, notably with cholelithiasis risk. We perform sex-stratified 
GWAS meta-analysis of lipid levels and show that 3-5% of autosomal 
lipid-associated loci demonstrate sex-biased effects. Finally, we report 21 
novel lipid loci identified on the X chromosome. Many of the sex-biased 
autosomal and X chromosome lipid loci show pleiotropic associations with sex 
hormones, emphasizing the role of hormone regulation in lipid metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings provide insights into the biological 
mechanisms through which associated variants lead to altered lipid levels and 
potentially cardiovascular disease risk."
349,"PURPOSE: The contribution of common genetic variants to pre-cancer progression 
is understudied due to long follow-up time, rarity of poor outcomes and lack of 
available germline DNA collection. Alternatively, DNA from diagnostic archival 
tissue is available, but its somatic nature, limited quantity and suboptimal 
quality would require an accurate cost-effective genome-wide germline genotyping 
methodology.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Blood and tissue DNA from 10 individuals were used to 
benchmark the accuracy of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) genotypes, 
Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) or HLA haplotypes using low-coverage whole-genome 
sequencing (lc-WGS) and genotype imputation. Tissue-derived PRS were further 
evaluated for 36 breast cancer patients (11.7 years median follow-up time) 
diagnosed with DCIS and used to model the risk of Breast Cancer Subsequent 
Events (BCSE).
RESULTS: Tissue-derived germline DNA profiling resulted in accurate genotypes at 
common SNPs (blood correlation r2 > 0.94) and across 22 disease-related 
polygenic risk scores (PRS, mean correlation r = 0.93). Imputed Class I and II 
HLA haplotypes were 96.7% and 82.5% concordant with clinical-grade blood HLA 
haplotypes, respectively. In DCIS patients, tissue-derived PRS was significantly 
associated with BCSE (HR = 2, 95% CI 1.2-3.8). The top and bottom decile 
patients had an estimated 28% and 5% chance of BCSE at 10 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Archival tissue DNA germline profiling using lc-WGS and imputation, 
represents a cost and resource-effective alternative in the retrospective design 
of long-term disease genetic studies. Initial results in breast cancer suggest 
that common risk variants contribute to pre-cancer progression."
350,"BACKGROUND: Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer 
worldwide and it has a poor prognosis for patients with distant metastasis. 
Nomograms are frequently used in clinical research, but no research has 
evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic factors of distant metastasis in 
urothelial bladder cancer (UBC).
METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to 
analyze all patients diagnosed with UBC between 2000 and 2017. Lasso regression 
was used to identify the potential risk predictive factors for distant 
metastasis in UBC. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard 
regression analyses were performed to determine independent prognostic factors 
for distant metastasis urothelial bladder cancer (DMUBC). Subsequently, two 
nomograms were constructed based on the above models. The receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC), and calibration curves were performed to evaluate the two 
nomograms.
RESULTS: The study included 73,264 patients with UBC, with 2,129 (2.9%) having 
distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. In the diagnostic model, tumor 
size, histologic type, and stage N and T were all important risk predictive 
factors for distant metastasis of UBC. In the prognostic model, age, tumor size, 
surgery, and chemotherapy were independent factors affecting the prognosis of 
DMUBC. DCA, ROC, calibration, and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves reveal that 
the two nomograms can effectively predict the diagnosis and prognosis of DMUBC.
CONCLUSION: The developed nomograms are practical methods for predicting the 
occurrence risk and prognosis of distant metastasis urothelial bladder cancer 
patients, which may benefit the clinical decision-making process."
351,"BACKGROUND: Molecule interacting with CasL 1 (MICAL1), a multidomain 
flavoprotein monooxygenase, is strongly involved in the biological processes 
related to cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. However, there were few 
reports on the clinical significance of MICAL1 in renal clear cell carcinoma.
METHODS: The expression and prognostic value of MICAL1 in renal clear cell 
carcinoma were explored using immunohistochemical assays, public TCGA-KIRC 
databases and multiple analysis methods, including survival analysis, univariate 
and multivariate analyses, KEGG and GSEA. Wound healing and Transwell assays 
were performed to check the 786-O cell and Caki-1 cell migration abilities after 
knockdown of MICAL1. Western blotting was used to assess the regulatory effect 
of MICAL1 on the Rac1 activation. Additionally, the function of MICAL1 and the 
correlations between MICAL1 and immune infiltration levels in KIRC were 
investigated using TIMER and TISIDB.
RESULTS: MICAL1 expression was significantly higher in carcinoma tissue compared 
with non-cancerous tissue. A survival analysis revealed that patients with high 
MICAL1 expression had shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-specific 
survival (DSS) compared with patients with low MICAL1 expression. ROC analysis 
also confirmed that MICAL1 has a high diagnostic value in KIRC. Importantly, the 
univariate and multivariate Cox analysis further confirmed that high MICAL1 
expression was an independent risk factor for OS in patients with KIRC. In 
accordance with this, knockdown of MICAL1 expression decreased Rac1 activation 
and cell migration. KEGG and GSEA analysis revealed that the immune infiltration 
and Ras signaling pathways were significantly upregulated in the high MICAL1 
expression group. In terms of immune infiltrating levels, MICAL1 expression was 
positively associated with CD8+/Treg cell infiltration levels. Specifically, 
bioinformatic analysis showed that MICAL1 expression had strong relationships 
with various T cell exhaustion markers.
CONCLUSIONS: MICAL1 expression may act as a prognostic biomarker for determining 
the prognosis in renal clear cell carcinoma and plays an important role in 
regulating tumor immune microenvironment and cell migratory capacity."
352,"BACKGROUND: SMYD3, a member of the SET and MYND domain-containing (SMYD) family, 
is a histone methyltransferase (HMT) and transcription factor that plays an 
important role in transcriptional regulation in human carcinogenesis.
RESULTS: Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry assays to identify 
SMYD3-associated proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, we found 
several previously undiscovered SMYD3-interacting proteins, including the NuRD 
(MTA1/2) complex, the METTL family, and the CRL4B complex. Transcriptomic 
analysis of the consequences of knocking down SMYD3, MTA1, or MTA2 in HCC cells 
showed that SMYD3/NuRD complex targets a cohort of genes, some of which are 
critically involved in cell growth and migration. qChIP analyses showed that 
SMYD3 knockdown led to a significant reduction in the binding of MTA1 or MTA2 to 
the promoters of IGFBP4 and led to a significant decrease in H4K20me3 and a 
marked increase in H4Ac at the IGFBP4 promoter. In addition, we demonstrated 
that SMYD3 promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis in vivo and 
in vitro and found that its expression is markedly upregulated in human liver 
cancer. Knockdown of MTA1 or MTA2 had the same effect as knockdown of SMYD3 on 
proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Catalytic mutant 
SMYD3 could not rescue the phenotypic effects caused by knockdown of SMYD3. 
Inhibitors of SMYD3 effectively inhibited the proliferation and invasiveness of 
HCC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed that SMYD3 could transcriptionally repress 
a cohort of target genes expression by associating with the NuRD (MTA1/2) 
complex, thereby promoting the proliferation and invasiveness of HCC cells. Our 
results support the case for pursuing SMYD3 as a practical prognostic marker or 
therapeutic target against HCC."
353,"BACKGROUND: Since the publication of MA-20 and EORTC-22922 trials, chest wall 
(CW)/ whole breast (WB) irradiation + comprehensive regional nodal irradiation 
(RNI) with internal mammary node irradiation (IMNI) has been the standard 
adjuvant treatment for early-stage breast cancer (BC). However, one size does 
not fit all BC, and the risk of recurrence significantly varies among this 
patient population. In addition, whether all BC patients presented with one to 
three positive lymph nodes (pN1) could benefit from IMNI remains controversial. 
Thus, the optimal adjuvant RNI volume for early-stage BC with T1-2N1 remains 
undetermined.
METHODS: The IMNI PRECISION trial is a single institute, open-labeled, 
non-inferior, randomized controlled trial. A total of 214 clinically ""high risk"" 
BC patients which is characterized as having at least two of the five clinically 
adverse factors (age ≤ 40, three positive LN, T2 stage, grade 3 and Ki-67 
index ≥ 14%), but genomic score ""low risk"" (the genomic score ≤ 44) N1 breast 
cancers are randomly assigned to omitting IMNI group (experimental group) or 
with IMNI (control group) with a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint of this trial 
is event-free survival, and secondary endpoints include overall survival and 
locoregional recurrence-free survival.
DISCUSSION: The IMNI PRECISION design allows promising clinical-genomic model to 
stratify the individualized risk of developing recurrence and guides the optimal 
RNI treatment for early-stage (pT1-2N1) BC patients. We anticipate that our 
results would provide high-level evidence to tailor IMNI according to 
individualized recurrence risk of BC.

354,"BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common malignant tumor that 
seriously affects human health. Previous studies have indicated that abnormal 
levels of glycosylation promote progression and poor prognosis of lung cancer. 
Thus, the present study aimed to explore the prognostic signature related to 
glycosyltransferases (GTs) for LUAD.
METHODS: The gene expression profiles were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) database, and GTs were obtained from the GlycomeDB database. 
Differentially expressed GTs-related genes (DGTs) were identified using edge 
package and Venn diagram. Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG), and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) methods were used to 
investigate the biological processes of DGTs. Subsequently, Cox and Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analyses were 
performed to construct a prognostic model for LUAD. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis 
was adopted to explore the overall survival (OS) of LUAD patients. The accuracy 
and specificity of the prognostic model were evaluated by receiver operating 
characteristic analysis (ROC). In addition, single-sample gene set enrichment 
analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm was used to analyze the infiltrating immune cells in 
the tumor environment.
RESULTS: A total of 48 DGTs were mainly enriched in the processes of 
glycosylation, glycoprotein biosynthetic process, glycosphingolipid 
biosynthesis-lacto and neolacto series, and cell-mediated immune response. 
Furthermore, B3GNT3, MFNG, GYLTL1B, ALG3, and GALNT13 were screened as 
prognostic genes to construct a risk model for LUAD, and the LUAD patients were 
divided into high- and low-risk groups. K-M curve suggested that patients with a 
high-risk score had shorter OS than those with a low-risk score. The ROC 
analysis demonstrated that the risk model efficiently diagnoses LUAD. 
Additionally, the proportion of infiltrating aDCs (p < 0.05) and Tgds (p < 0.01) 
was higher in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. Spearman's 
correlation analysis manifested that the prognostic genes (MFNG and ALG3) were 
significantly correlated with infiltrating immune cells.
CONCLUSION: In summary, this study established a novel GTs-related risk model 
for the prognosis of LUAD patients, providing new therapeutic targets for LUAD. 
However, the biological role of glycosylation-related genes in LUAD needs to be 
explored further."
355,"BACKGROUND: Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is frequently observed in young 
adults. There is no wide consensus on optimal treatment in the literature, and 
various procedures are used in clinical practice. The objective of this study 
was to assess current practice, experience, training, and attitudes towards PSD 
surgery among Norwegian surgeons.
METHODS: An online survey on PSD surgery was created and sent to all members of 
the Norwegian Surgical Association. Categorical data were reported as 
frequencies and percentages.
RESULTS: Most currently practicing Norwegian surgeons used the Bascom's cleft 
lift (93.2%) or minimally invasive procedures (55.4%). Midline excisions with 
primary closure (19.7%) or secondary healing (22.4%) were still used by some 
surgeons, though. Most surgeons had received training in PSD surgery supervised 
by a specialist, but only about half of them felt sufficiently trained. The 
surgeons generally performed few PSD operations per year. Many considered PSD as 
a condition of low surgical status and this patient group as underprioritized.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PSD surgery in Norway has been moving 
away from midline excisions and towards off-midline flap procedures and 
minimally invasive techniques. PSD and its treatment have a low status among 
many Norwegian surgeons. This study calls for attention to this underprioritized 
group of patients and shows the need for consensus in PSD treatment such as 
development of national guidelines in Norway. Further investigation on training 
in PSD and the role of supervision is needed."
356,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-related pelvic pain can be difficult and debilitating to 
treat. Superior hypogastric plexus neurolysis (SHPN) is a good choice for 
adequate pain relief with fewer side effects. The current study compared between 
fluoroscopic anterior approach and ultrasound guided SHPN in the management of 
cancer-related pelvic pain.
METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups. The ultrasound 
group (US group) (n = 48) received SHPN by an ultrasound-guided anterior 
approach using 3 ml 5% bupivacaine plus 20 ml 10% phenol, while the fluoroscopy 
group (n = 48) received SHPN by a fluoroscopy-guided anterior approach using 
3 ml 5% bupivacaine plus 20 ml 10% phenol.
RESULTS: The time of the procedure was shorter in the fluoroscopic group 
(21.31 ± 4.79 min) than the US group (24.88 ± 6.02 min) (P = 0.002). Patient 
satisfaction was higher in the fluoroscopy group (5.38 ± 1.482) than the US 
group (2.98 ± 1.495) (P˂0.001). The need for analgesia using morphine was 
significantly limited in each group, at 1, 2 and 3 months intervals (P1˂0.001, 
P2 ˂0.001 and P3 ˂0.001). There were statistically significant differences 
between both groups regarding fatigue at baseline, drowsiness at 3 months, 
nausea and vomiting at 1, 2 and 3 months and anorexia at 3 months. Group 
comparison also revealed statistically significant differences regarding 
depression at one month, anxiety at 2 and 3 months and insomnia at baseline.
CONCLUSION: The fluoroscopic anterior approach SHPN was more superior than the 
US guided SHPN regarding the time of the procedure and patient satisfaction, 
while both technique were similar regarding the numeric rating scale and the 
complications during block.

357,"BACKGROUND: Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by 
the destruction of exocrine glands, resulting in dry mouth and eyes. Currently, 
there is no effective treatment for SS, and the mechanisms associated with 
inadequate salivary secretion are poorly understood.
METHODS: In this study, we used NOD mice model to monitor changes in mice's 
salivary secretion and water consumption. Tissue morphology of the submandibular 
glands was examined by H&E staining, and Immunohistochemical detected the 
expression of AQP5 (an essential protein in salivary secretion). Global gene 
expression profiling was performed on submandibular gland tissue of extracted 
NOD mice model using RNA-seq. Subsequently, a series of bioinformatics analyses 
of transcriptome sequencing was performed, including differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) identification, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, PPI network construction, hub gene 
identification, and the validity of diagnostic indicators using the dataset 
GSE40611. Finally, IFN-γ was used to treat the cells, the submandibular gland 
tissue of NOD mice model was extracted, and RT-qPCR was applied to verify the 
expression of hub genes.
RESULTS: We found that NOD mice model had reduced salivary secretion and 
increased water consumption. H&E staining suggests acinar destruction and 
basement membrane changes in glandular tissue. Immunohistochemistry detects a 
decrease in AQP5 immunostaining within acinar. In transcriptome sequencing, 42 
overlapping DEGs were identified, and hub genes (REN, A2M, SNCA, KLK3, TTR, and 
AZGP1) were identified as initiating targets for insulin signaling. In addition, 
insulin signaling and cAMP signaling are potential pathways for regulating 
salivary secretion and constructing a regulatory relationship between 
target-cAMP signaling-salivary secretion.
CONCLUSION: The new potential targets and signal axes for regulating salivary 
secretion provide a strategy for SS therapy in a clinical setting."
358,"Phenotypic evolution is often caused by variation in gene expression resulting 
from altered gene regulatory mechanisms. Genetic variation affecting chromatin

expression; however, the roles of specific chromatin remodeling factors remain 
unclear. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining the relationship 
between variation in gene expression, variation in chromatin structure, and 
variation in binding of the pioneer factor Grainy head between imaginal wing 
discs of two divergent strains of Drosophila melanogaster and their F1 hybrid. 
We find that (1) variation in Grainy head binding is mostly due to sequence 
changes that act in cis but are located outside of the canonical Grainy head 
binding motif, (2) variation in Grainy head binding correlates with changes in 
chromatin accessibility, and (3) this variation in chromatin accessibility, 
coupled with variation in Grainy head binding, correlates with variation in gene 
expression in some cases but not others. Interactions among these three 
molecular layers is complex, but these results suggest that genetic variation 
affecting the binding of pioneer factors contributes to variation in chromatin 
remodeling and the evolution of gene expression."
359,"Phototheranostics has received sustained attention due to its great potential in 
revolutionizing conventional strategies of cancer treatment. However, trapped by 
the complexity, poor reproducibility, insufficient phototheranostic outputs, and 
inevitable damage to normal tissue of most multicomponent phototheranostic 
systems, its clinical translation has been severely hindered. Therefore, the 
exploration of ""one for all"" smart phototheranostic agents with versatile 
functionalities remains an appealing yet enormously challenging task. Herein, a 
reversibly pH-switchable and near-infrared second photosensitizer featuring 
aggregation-induced emission was tactfully designed by molecular engineering for 
precise tumor-targeting fluorescence imaging-guided phototherapy. Thanks to the 
strong intramolecular charge transfer, enhanced highly efficient intersystem 
crossing, and sufficient intramolecular motion, the developed agent DTTVBI was 
endowed with boosted type-I superoxide anion radical generation and excellent 
photothermal performance under 808 nm laser irradiation. More importantly, 
DTTVBI nanoparticles with high biocompatibility exhibit remarkably enhanced 
type-I photodynamic/photothermal therapy in the tumor region, thus offering 
significant antitumor effects both in vitro and in the patient-derived tumor 
xenograft model of colon cancer. This work sheds new light on the development of 
superior versatile phototheranostics for cancer therapy."
360,"BACKGROUND: Accurate rectal tumor staging guides the choice of treatment 
options. EUS and MRI are the main modalities for staging.
AIM OF THE WORK: To compare the performance of EUS and MRI for loco-regional 
staging of anorectal cancer after neo-adjuvant therapy.
METHODS: Seventy-three (37 male, 36 female) patients with rectal cancer after 
neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy were enrolled. Histopathological staging after 
surgery were used as reference for comparing the yield of loco-regional staging 
for EUS and MRI. EUS and MRI were done 1 month after completion of neo-adjuvant 
therapy.
RESULTS: Regarding post-surgical T staging, eight patients had early tumor 
(T2 = 16 and T1 = 9) and thirty six were locally advanced (T3 = 36), while N 
staging, forty patients with negative nodes and 33 were positive (N1 = 22 and 
N2 = 11). Comparing EUS to MRI, it showed a higher sensitivity (95.7% vs. 
78.7%), specificity (84.6% vs. 68.0%) and accuracy (91.8% vs. 75.3%) for staging 
early and locally advanced tumor. Also, it had a higher sensitivity (78.8% vs. 
69.7%), specificity (75.0% vs. 65.0%) and accuracy (76.7% vs. 67.1%) for 
detection of lymph nodes.
CONCLUSION: EUS appears to be more accurate than MRI in loco-regional staging of 
rectal carcinoma after neo-adjuvant therapy."
361,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the predictors of residual disease in a hysterectomy 
following a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3.
METHODS: This retrospective study identified 421 patients with histologically 
confirmed CIN 3 who underwent LEEP and subsequently had a hysterectomy within 6 
months. The clinical data included age, parity, type of transformation zone, 
cytology results, human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype test, endocervical 
curettage (ECC), and pathological data of LEEP and hysterectomy were obtained 
from the medical records. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the 
relationship between the variables and the risk of residual disease in the 
hysterectomy samples.
RESULTS: 186 (44.18%) patients had residual disease in the hysterectomy 
specimens. The predictive markers of residual disease following LEEP included 
positive ECC, positive margin of the samples from LEEP, type II or III 
transformation zone, HPV16 and HPV18 infection, and other high-risk HPV. HPV-18 
positivity (OR, 7.13; 95% CI, 3.49 to 14.56; p < 0.001) and type III 
transformation zone (OR, 6.37; 95% CI, 2.91 to 13.94; p < 0.001) were the most 
indicative of residual disease following LEEP.
CONCLUSION: Positive high-risk HPV, particularly HPV18, positive ECC, the 
positive margin of specimens from LEEP, and type II or III transformation zone 
were reliable prognostic markers of residual disease following a LEEP for CIN 3."
362,"Radiation therapy (RT) can enhance the abscopal effect of immune checkpoint 
blockade. This phase I/II study investigated the efficacy and safety of 
nivolumab plus RT in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer requiring palliative 
RT for bone metastases. Cohort A included luminal-like disease, and cohort B 
included both luminal-like and triple-negative disease refractory to standard 
systemic therapy. Patients received 8 Gy single fraction RT for bone metastasis 
on day 0. Nivolumab was administered on day 1 for each 14-day cycle. In cohort 
A, endocrine therapy was administered. The primary endpoint was the objective 
response rate (ORR) of the unirradiated lesions. Cohorts A and B consisted of 18 
and 10 patients, respectively. The ORR was 11% (90% CI 4-29%) in cohort A and 0% 
in cohort B. Disease control rates were 39% (90% CI 23-58%) and 0%. Median 
progression-free survival was 4.1 months (95% CI 2.1-6.1 months) and 2.0 months 
(95% CI 1.2-3.7 months). One patient in cohort B experienced a grade 3 adverse 
event. Palliative RT combined with nivolumab was safe and showed modest 
anti-tumor activity in cohort A. Further investigations to enhance the 
anti-tumor effect of endocrine therapy combined with RT plus immune checkpoint 
blockade are warranted.Trial registration number and date of registration UMIN:

363,"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a leading cause of cancer 
death in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs). Relapsed or refractory (R/R) 
PTLD portends a high risk of death and effective management is not well 
established. CD19-targeted CAR-T cell therapy has been utilized, but the risks 
and benefits are unknown. We report the first case of diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) PTLD treated with lisocabtagene maraleucel and present a 
systematic literature review of SOTRs with PTLD treated with CD19 CAR-T therapy. 
Our patient achieved a complete response (CR) with limited toxicity but 
experienced a CD19+ relapse 8 months after infusion despite CAR-T persistence. 
Literature review revealed 14 DLBCL and 2 Burkitt lymphoma PTLD cases treated 
with CD19 CAR-T cells. Kidney (n = 12), liver (n = 2), heart (n = 2), and 
pancreas after kidney (n = 1) transplant recipients were analyzed. The objective 
response rate (ORR) was 82.4% (14/17), with 58.5% (10/17) CRs and a 6.5-month 
median duration of response. Among kidney transplant recipients, the ORR was 
91.7% (11/12). Allograft rejection occurred in 23.5% (4/17). No graft failure 
occurred. Our analysis suggests that CD19 CAR-T therapy offers short-term 
effectiveness and manageable toxicity in SOTRs with R/R PTLD. Further 
investigation through larger datasets and prospective study is needed."
364,"PURPOSE: Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) 
which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity. To date, the effect of ICD 
on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this research, we will study 
the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.
METHODS: RNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts 
and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were 
identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall 
survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were 
identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association 
between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic 
mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.
RESULTS: Consensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters 
(ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME 
cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three 
ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best 
prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above 
analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of 
cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 
3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. 
Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk 
signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high 
infiltration of immune-active cells.
CONCLUSION: This study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, 
excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding 
immunotherapy and chemotherapy."
365,"AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver 
cancer. Expression defects and turnover of basement membrane (BM) proteins are 
key pathogenic factors in cancer. It is still uncertain how the expression of 
BM-related genes (BMGs) in HCC relates to prognosis.
METHODS: All of the HCC cohort's RNA-seq and clinical information came from TCGA 
datasets. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
algorithm was utilized to filter down the candidate genes and construct the 
prognostic model. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were run to examine 
if the risk score may serve as a standalone prognostic indicator. The 
single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was utilized to analyze 
examine immune cell infiltration and pathway activity.
RESULTS: Five genes and their risk coefficients were eventually identified and 
patients with HCC were classified as either high or low risk based on the median 
of risk scores. Multivariate Cox regression analysis found a significant 
correlation between risk score and OS (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that 
BMGs signature had good prediction ability for HCC patients in age, gender, T 
stage, and AJCC stage (all p < 0.05). According to the ssGSEA, the high-risk 
subgroup showed higher levels of immune cell infiltration and immune-related 
pathways were more engaged in the high-risk group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research systematically built a prognostic model using risk 
score based on BMGs signature in HCC patients. The immune feature analysis of 
the BMGs signature indicated a potential regulation between tumor immunity and 
BM in HCC."
366,"PURPOSE: Intraoperative identification of lung tumors can be challenging. 
Tumor-targeted fluorescence-guided surgery can provide surgeons with a tool for 
real-time intraoperative tumor detection. This study evaluated cell surface 
biomarkers, partially selected via data-driven selection software, as potential 
targets for fluorescence-guided surgery in non-small cell lung cancers: 
adenocarcinomas (ADC), adenocarcinomas in situ (AIS), and squamous cell 
carcinomas (SCC).
PROCEDURES: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides of resection 
specimens from 15 patients with ADC and 15 patients with SCC were used and 
compared to healthy tissue. Molecular targets were selected based on two 
strategies: (1) a data-driven selection using > 275 multi-omics databases, 
literature, and experimental evidence; and (2) the availability of a fluorescent 
targeting ligand in advanced stages of clinical development. The selected 
targets were carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAIX), collagen type XVII alpha 1 chain 
(collagen XVII), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), G protein-coupled receptor 87 
(GPR87), transmembrane protease serine 4 (TMPRSS4), carcinoembryonic antigen 
(CEA), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), folate receptor alpha (FRα), 
integrin αvβ6 (αvβ6), and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). 
Tumor expression of these targets was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. 
A total immunostaining score (TIS, range 0-12), combining the percentage and 
intensity of stained cells, was calculated. The most promising targets in ADC 
were explored in six AIS tissue slides to explore its potential in non-palpable 
lesions.
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in TIS between healthy lung and 
tumor tissue for ADC samples were found for CEA, EpCAM, FRα, αvβ6, CAIX, 
collagen XVII, GLUT-1, and TMPRSS4, and of these, CEA, CAIX, and collagen XVII 
were also found in AIS. For SCC, EpCAM, uPAR, CAIX, collagen XVII, and GLUT-1 
were found to be overexpressed.
CONCLUSIONS: EpCAM, CAIX, and Collagen XVII were identified using concomitant 
use of data-driven selection software and clinical evidence as promising targets 
for intraoperative fluorescence imaging for both major subtypes of non-small 
cell lung carcinomas."
367,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends 
a second-line treatment of pemigatinib for patients with intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma with fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) 
fusions/rearrangements and modified FOLFOX (mFOLFOX) for those without FGFR2 
alterations. However, these regimens are not yet covered by Taiwa's National 
Health Insurance. This cost-effectiveness analysis evaluated the 
cost-effectiveness of the pemigatinib/mFOLFOX regimen as the second-line 
treatment for advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma based on FGFR2 status in 
comparison with the regimen of fluorouracil chemotherapy and provided a 
cost-effectiveness analysis-based reference price for pemigatinib.
METHODS: A three-state partitioned survival model with a 5-year time horizon was 
constructed for patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who did 
not respond to first-line therapy. Overall and progression-free survival 
functions of pemigatinib, mFOLFOX, and fluorouracil were estimated from the 
FIGHT-202, ABC-06, and NIFTY trials, respectively. The utility of health states 
and disutility of adverse events were obtained from the literature. The genetic 
testing fee and price of pemigatinib were set as the market price. Other costs 
related to advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were calculated using 
National Health Insurance claims data. The willingness-to-pay threshold was 
three times the gross domestic product per capita in 2021 (NT$2,889,684). A 3% 
discount rate was applied to quality-adjusted life-years and costs. Scenario 
analyses included a gradual price reduction of pemigatinib, alternative survival 
models, application of a National Health Insurance payment conversion factor to 
non-medication costs, and consideration of life-years as effectiveness. A 
deterministic sensitivity analysis, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and a 
value of information analysis were performed.
RESULTS: The new regimen provided an incremental 0.13 quality-adjusted 
life-years, with incremental costs of NT$459,697, yielding an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio of NT$3,411,098 per quality-adjusted life-year and an 
incremental net monetary benefit of - NT$70,268. The new regimen was found to be 
53.2% cost effective in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The expected 
value of uncertainty measured by the expected value of perfect information was 
NT$80,695/person. In scenario analyses, the incremental net monetary benefit was 
positive when the price of pemigatinib was reduced by 40% or more. When applying 
a conversion factor to non-medical costs, the probability of the new regimen 
being cost effective was slightly increased from 53.2 to 56.5% compared with the 
base-case analysis. The utility and the cost of the new regimen were the main 
drivers of uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the new second-line genetic-based and biomarker-driven 
regimen of pemigatinib/mFOLFOX appears not cost effective for patients with 
advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in the base-case analysis, our analysis 
suggests it is highly likely to be cost effective in the case of a 40% price 
reduction on pemigatinib."
368,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) are 
volumetric parameters derived from 18F-FDG PET/CT, suggested to have a 
prognostic value in cancer patients. Our study aimed to test whether these 
volumetric parameters of the primary tumor and whole-body tumor burden (WBTB) 
can predict overall survival (OS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty biopsy-proven NSCLC patients who had not begun 
anti-tumor therapy were included in this prospective study. A baseline 18F-FDG 
PET/CT study was acquired. Scans were interpreted visually and 
semi-quantitatively by drawing a 3D volume of interest (VOI) over the primary 
tumor and all positive lesions to calculate metabolic, volumetric parameters, 
and WBTB. The PET parameters were used to stratify patients into high- and 
low-risk categories. The overall survival was estimated from the date of 
scanning until the date of death or last follow-up.
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 22.73 months, the mean OS was shorter among 
patients with higher tu MTV and tu TLG and high WBTB. High WB TLG was 
independently associated with the risk of death (p < 0.025). Other parameters, 
e.g., SUVmax, SUVpeak, and SUVmean, were not predictive of outcomes in these 
patients.
CONCLUSION: In patients with NSCLC, tu MTV, tu TLG, and WBTB determined on 
initial staging 18F-FDG PET/CT seems to be a strong, independent imaging 
biomarker to predict OS, superior to the clinical assessment of the primary 
tumor. The WB TLG was found to be the best predictor of OS."
369,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) function by inhibiting 
base excision repair and inducing synthetic lethality in homologous 
recombination repair-deficient cells, such as BRCA1/2-mutated cancer cells. The 
BCR/ABL1 fusion protein causes dysregulated cell proliferation and is 
responsible for chronic myelogenous leukemia and Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL). BCR/ABL1 also induces 
genomic instability by downregulating BRCA1. We investigated the effect of the 
PARPi, olaparib, against Ph+ALL cell lines and found that they show variable 
sensitivity, presumably due to cancer-associated genetic alterations other than 
BCR/ABL1. To investigate the reasons for the variable responses of Ph+ALL cells 
to PARPi treatment, we analyzed the transcriptomes of olaparib-sensitive and 
-resistant Ph+ALL cell lines, which revealed that activation of the 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway was a hallmark of PARPi resistance. 
Based on these findings, we examined the effects of adding a PI3K inhibitor 
(PI3Ki) to PARPi treatment to overcome PARPi insensitivity in Ph+ALL cell lines. 
Combination with PI3Ki increased PARPi cytotoxicity in PARPi-resistant Ph+ALL 
cell lines. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is the gold standard for 
Ph+ALL, and, based on our findings, we propose that PARPi combined with TKI and 
PI3K inhibition could be a novel therapeutic strategy for Ph+ALL."

372,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are utilized as a carrier of 
anti-tumor agents in targeted anti-cancer therapy. Despite the improvements in 
this area, there are still some unsolved issues in determining the appropriate 
dose, method of administration and biodistribution of MSCs. The current study 
aimed to determine the influence of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulation on 
the potential of MSCs migration to the neoplasm environment in the mouse 
melanoma model.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) were isolated from the GFP+ 
transgenic C57BL/6 mouse and treated with different doses (1 µg/ml and 10 µg/ml) 
of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, the related TLR3 agonist, at various time 
points (1 and 4 h). Following the treatment, the expression of targeted genes 
such as α4, α5, and β1 integrins and TGF-β and IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokines 
was determined using real-time PCR. In vivo live imaging evaluated the migration 
index of the intraperitoneally (IP) injected treated ADMSCs in a lung 
tumor-bearing mouse (C57BL/6) melanoma model (n = 5). The presented findings 
demonstrated that TLR3 stimulation enhanced both migration of ADMSCs to the 
tumor area compared with control group (n = 5) and expression of α4, α5, and β1 
integrins. It was also detected that the engagement of TLR3 resulted in the 
anti-inflammatory behavior of the cells, which might influence the directed 
movement of ADMSCs.
CONCLUSION: This research identified that TLR3 activation might improve the 
migration via the stimulation of stress response in the cells and depending on 
the agonist concentration and time exposure, this activated pathway drives the 
migratory behavior of MSCs."
373,"Glioma is a primary brain tumor with limited treatment approaches and 
glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are manifested with the self-renewal capability 
and high tumorigenic capacity. This study was performed to investigate the 
regulatory effect of the SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1)/methyltransferase-like 
3 (METTL3)/MYC axis on the self-renewal of GSCs mediated by transcription factor 
Yin Yang 1 (YY1). Following bioinformatics analysis and clinical and cellular 
experiments, we found that YY1 was highly expressed in GBM tissues and cells, 
while silencing its expression reduced the self-renewal ability of GSCs. 
Functionally, YY1 promoted the transcriptional expression of SENP1 by binding to 
the promoter region of SENP1, while the deSUMOase SENP1 facilitated the 
methylase activity of m6A through deSUMOylation of the methylase METTL3, thereby 
promoting the m6A modification of MYC mRNA via METL3 and promoting the 
expression of MYC. A nude mouse xenograft model of GBM was also constructed to 
examine the tumorigenicity of GSCs. The obtained findings demonstrated that YY1 
promoted tumorigenicity of GSCs by promoting the expression of MYC in vivo. 
Conclusively, YY1 can transcriptionally upregulate the SUMOylase SENP1 and 
enhance the methylase activity of METTL3, resulting in the increased m6A 
modification level of MYC mRNA, thereby promoting the self-renewal of GSCs."
374,"Integration of high-dimensional tumor gene expression data with 
clinicopathological data can increase our understanding of disease diversity, 
enable retrospective patient stratification, and identify new potential 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Using a systems biology approach, we provide 
a holistic overview of gene co-expression networks in head and neck squamous 
cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis of HNSCC 
RNA sequencing data from 519 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was 
used to determine correlates of 5-year survival, using regression tree-based 
optimal threshold calculations. Survival-associated gene sets were transformed 
to gene set scores that were assessed for correlation with clinicopathological 
data. We identified 8 gene co-expression modules for HNSCC tumors, each of which 
contained co-expressed genes associated significantly with 5-year survival. 
Survival-associated co-expression gene signatures correlated dominantly with 
tumor HPV and p16 status. Network analysis identified that survival was 
associated with signaling networks of infection, immunity, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, glycolysis, focal adhesion, 
extracellular matrix, MYC signaling, autophagy and transcriptional regulation. 
EMT-associated gene signatures were expressed dominantly in fibroblasts, and 
cancer-associated fibroblasts were inversely correlated with immune activity. 
Interestingly, a high Immune Suppression Score based on expression of 21 genes 
associated with immune inhibition and including immune checkpoints, cytokines 
and regulatory T cell factors, was also associated with increased survival 
probability, and was significantly higher in HPV+ HNSCC. Networks associated 
with HNSCC survival were further associated with survival in cervical cancer, 
melanoma and lung cancer. This study defines 5129 genes associated with HNSCC 
survival, organized into co-expressed networks, their correlation with 
clinicopathological data, and with gene expression data from other malignant 
diseases, and provides a source for the discovery of biomarkers and novel 
therapies for HNSCC."

pediatric cancer patients for comprehensive molecular analysis. We report a 
two-year pilot study implementing ex vivo drug sensitivity profiling (DSP) using 
a library of 75-78 clinically relevant drugs. We included 132 viable tumor 
samples from 35 pediatric oncology centers in seven countries. DSP was conducted 
on multicellular fresh tumor tissue spheroid cultures in 384-well plates with an 
overall mean processing time of three weeks. In 89 cases (67%), sufficient 
viable tissue was received; 69 (78%) passed internal quality controls. The DSP 
results matched the identified molecular targets, including BRAF, ALK, MET, and 
TP53 status. Drug vulnerabilities were identified in 80% of cases lacking 
actionable (very) high-evidence molecular events, adding value to the molecular 
data. Striking parallels between clinical courses and the DSP results were 
observed in selected patients. Overall, DSP in clinical real-time is feasible in 
international multicenter precision oncology programs."
376,"Contrast agents are used to enhance the visibility of rodent organs during in 
vivo micro-computed tomography imaging. Specifically, this non-invasive 
technique can study liver tumor growth and progression in small animals. 
Fenestra VC and the novel Fenestra HDVC were compared for enhancement in the 
liver of healthy and tumor-bearing mice, and the images were compared for their 
ability to define the tumor border, volume and quantity of tumors. Fenestra VC 
and Fenestra HDVC were injected into healthy eight-week-old female mice 
(C57BL/6) via the tail vein then imaged at seven different time points. The 
experimental results showed that 0.005 mL/g of Fenestra HDVC resulted in the 
same enhancement for all eight organs as 0.01 mL/g of Fenestra VC across all 
time points. For the tumor study, B16F10 tumors were surgically introduced into 
ten eight-week-old female mice (C57BL/6) then imaged in vivo over a 3 day 
period. Ex vivo micro-CT images of the excised livers were also obtained. The 
tumor volume and quantity were measured in each image, and the tumour 
progression observed over 3 days. We showed Fenestra HDVC is effective for in 
vivo imaging in rodents because the optimal enhancement level in organs is 
maintained at a reduced injection volume."
377,"There is a paucity of data on management strategies and clinical outcomes after 
recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). In a multicenter registry enrolling 3027 
patients with acute symptomatic VTE, the current study population was divided 
into the following 3 groups: (1) First recurrent VTE during anticoagulation 
therapy (N = 110); (2) First recurrent VTE after discontinuation of 
anticoagulation therapy (N = 116); and (3) No recurrent VTE (N = 2801). Patients 
with first recurrent VTE during anticoagulation therapy more often had active 
cancer (45, 25 and 22%, P < 0.001). Among 110 patients with first recurrent VTE 
during anticoagulation therapy, 84 patients (76%) received warfarin at recurrent 
VTE with the median prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) 
value at recurrent VTE of 1.6, although patients with active cancer had a 
significantly higher median PT-INR value at recurrent VTE compared with those 
without active cancer (2.0 versus 1.4, P < 0.001). Within 90 days after 
recurrent VTE, 23 patients (20.9%) during anticoagulation therapy and 24 
patients (20.7%) after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy died. Active 
cancer was a major cause of recurrent VTE during anticoagulation therapy as a 
patient-related factor, while sub-optimal intensity of anticoagulation therapy 
was a major cause of recurrent VTE during anticoagulation therapy as a 
treatment-related factor, particularly in patients without active cancer."
378,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to clarify the frequency of thoracic 
recurrence and identify associated pathological features in postoperative 
patients with borderline or malignant ovarian epithelial tumors (BMOT) in stage 
I versus higher stages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 368 consecutive patients with a single primary 
BMOT were treated at our hospital. This study included the 217 patients with no 
residual disease on the first CT after standard treatment. The timing and 
pattern of recurrence on follow-up CT images with a scan range from chest to 
pelvis were evaluated retrospectively. Patient characteristics, tumor histology, 
and stage were recorded from electronic medical records.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up period of 48 months, recurrence was detected 
by CT in 9 patients in stage I (n = 159) and 15 in stage II/III (n = 58) 
(p = 0.0001). Thoracic recurrence was detected in four patients in stage I and 
four in stage II/III (p = 0.15). Abdominal recurrence was identified as a factor 
associated with thoracic recurrence (P < 0.001). Clear cell carcinomas accounted 
for three out of four thoracic recurrences in stage I and two out of four in 
stage II/III, and had the highest rates of thoracic recurrence (7.7% in stage I 
and 22.2% in stage II/III) among all histological types associated with thoracic 
recurrence. Among patients with recurrence, thoracic recurrence-free probability 
(p = 0.38), median abdominal recurrence-free interval (18 vs 16 months; 
p = 0.55) and thoracic recurrence-free interval (16.5 vs 23 months; p = 0.89) 
did not differ significantly between stage I and stage II/III.
CONCLUSION: The frequency and timing of thoracic recurrence did not differ 
significantly in postoperative patients with BMOT in stage I versus stage 
II/III. Abdominal recurrence and a histological type of clear cell carcinoma 
were most often associated with thoracic recurrence in stage I."
379,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia has a 
high mortality rate; however, its treatment methods have not been standardized.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old man with rheumatoid arthritis developed acute 
respiratory failure about 3 weeks after lung cancer surgery. There were 
increased diffuse frosted shadows in both lung fields. His condition was 
diagnosed as an acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia associated with 
rheumatoid arthritis, and he was started on steroid pulse therapy; however, his 
respiratory condition deteriorated. He was urgently intubated and started on 
veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Further, intensive care, 
including blood purification therapy, was initiated. The blood purification 
therapy comprised a combination of hemodiafiltration and 6-h polymyxin 
B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion. The patient was weaned off 
veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, extubated, and discharged from 
the intensive care unit on the ninth day.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood purification therapy was effective for acute exacerbation of 
interstitial pneumonia."
380,"N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) detected above the acceptable level in ranitidine 
products has been a great global concern. To examine the risk of cancer among 
people treated with ranitidine, we conducted a cohort study using the National 
Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort data (2002-2015) of South Korea. 
Patients were aged 40 or above as of January 2004 and began receiving ranitidine 
or other histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), active comparator, without a 
history of H2RAs prescription during the prior 2-years. The lag time was 
designated up to 6 years. The outcomes were an overall incident cancer risk and 
the risk of major single cancers during the follow-up. The association between 
ranitidine use and cancer risk was examined by Cox regression model. After 
exclusion and propensity score matching, 25,360 patients were available for 
analysis. The use of ranitidine was not associated with the overall cancer risk 
and major individual cancers [overall cancer: incidence rate per 1000 
person-years, 2.9 vs 3.0 among the ranitidine users and other H2RAs users, 
respectively; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 
for all cancers, 0.98 (0.81-1.20)]. The higher cumulative exposure to ranitidine 
did not increase the cancer risk. Given the insufficient follow-up period, these 
findings should be interpreted carefully."
381,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an effective target for those 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancers that retain the wild-type RAS gene. 
However, its efficacy in many cancers, including bladder cancer, is unclear. 
Here, we studied the in vitro effects of cetuximab monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
targeting EGFR on the bladder cancer cells and role of CD46. Cetuximab was found 
to inhibit the growth of both colon and bladder cancer cell lines. Furthermore, 
cetuximab treatment inhibited AKT and ERK phosphorylation in the bladder cancer 
cells and reduced the expression of CD46 membrane-bound proteins. Restoration of 
CD46 expression protected the bladder cancer cells from cetuximab-mediated 
inhibition of AKT and ERK phosphorylation. We hypothesized that CD46 provides 
protection to the bladder cancer cells against mAb therapies. Bladder cancer 
cells were also susceptible to cetuximab-mediated immunologic anti-tumor 
effects. Further, cetuximab enhanced the cell killing by activating both 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC) in bladder cancer cells. Restoration of CD46 expression 
protected the cells from both CDC and ADCC induced by cetuximab. Together, CD46 
exhibited a cancer-protective effect against both direct (by involvement of PBMC 
or complement) and indirect cytotoxic activity by cetuximab in bladder cancer 
cells. Considering its clinical importance, CD46 could be an important link in 
the action mechanism of ADCC and CDC intercommunication and may be used for the 
development of novel therapeutic strategies."
382,"Cladosporium spp. have been reported for their great diversity of secondary 
metabolites which represent as a prominent base material for verifying the 
biological activities. Several bioactive compounds which have antimicrobial, 
cytotoxic, quorum sensing inhibitory and phytotoxic activities have been 
isolated from Cladosporium species. Most of them are still needed to be explored 
for their anticancer properties. Therefore, the present study is focused on 
screening and identifying the bioactive compounds of Cladosporium spp. for their 
anticancer activity via the integrated approaches of Molecular Docking (MD), 
Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies. 
A total of 123 bioactive compounds of Cladosporium spp. were explored for their 
binding affinity with the selected breast cancer drug target receptor such as 
estrogen receptor alpha (PDB:6CBZ). The Molecular Docking studies revealed that 
amongst the bioactive compounds screened, Altertoxin X and Cladosporol H showed 
a good binding affinity of - 10.5 kcal/mol and - 10.3 kcal/mol, respectively, 
with the estrogen receptor alpha when compared to the reference compound 
(17[Formula: see text]-Estradiol: - 10.2 kcal/mol). The MDS study indicated the 
stable binding patterns and conformation of the estrogen receptor 
alpha-Altertoxin X complex in a stimulating environment. In addition, in silico 
absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) study 
suggested that Altertoxin X has a good oral bioavailability with a high 
LD[Formula: see text] value of 2.375 mol/kg and did not cause any hepatotoxicity 
and skin sensitization. In summary, the integrated approaches revealed that 
Altertoxin X possesses a promising anticancer activity and could serve as a new 
therapeutic drug for breast cancer treatment."
383,"BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the necessity of endoscopic sphincterotomy 
(ES) to prevent post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis 
(PEP) after endoscopic stenting in patients with malignant biliary obstruction. 
We investigated the incidence of PEP after endoscopic biliary stenting for 
malignant biliary obstruction with or without ES in a multicenter prospective 
cohort study.
METHODS: We enrolled 807 patients who underwent endoscopic biliary stenting for 
malignant biliary obstruction with a native papilla at 36 hospitals between 
April 2017 and March 2018. The incidence of PEP in patients with or without ES 
was compared for subgroups based on stent type, placement method, and patient 
background. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to investigate 
the incidence of PEP in all stenting patients.
RESULTS: Plastic and metal stents (MS) were inserted in 598 and 209 patients, 
respectively. The incidence of PEP in patients with or without ES was 7.9% and 
7.4%, respectively among all stenting patients. The incidences of PEP with or 
without ES in plastic stent insertion patients, patients with MS insertion, 
stent insertions across the papilla, stent insertions across the papilla in 
patients without main pancreatic duct obstruction, and fully covered MS 
insertions across the papilla were compared. There was no overall significant 
difference in the incidence of PEP between those with or without ES. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis for the incidence of PEP in all 
stenting patients revealed obstruction of the main pancreatic duct at the 
pancreatic head and epinephrine spraying on the papilla were significant 
factors; there was no significant difference in the incidence of PEP between 
patients with or without ES.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic sphincterotomy may not contribute to the prevention of 
PEP after endoscopic biliary stenting for malignant biliary obstruction, even in 
cases of insertion with a fully covered MS across the papilla."
384,"Third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), including 
osimertinib, an irreversible EGFR-TKI, are important treatments for non-small 
cell lung cancer with EGFR-TKI sensitizing or EGFR T790M resistance mutations. 
While patients treated with osimertinib show clinical benefit, disease 
progression and drug resistance are common. Emergence of de novo acquired 
resistance from a drug tolerant persister (DTP) cell population is one mechanism 
proposed to explain progression on osimertinib and other targeted cancer 
therapies. Here we profiled osimertinib DTPs using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to 
characterize the features of these cells and performed drug screens to identify 
therapeutic vulnerabilities. We identified several vulnerabilities in 
osimertinib DTPs that were common across models, including sensitivity to MEK, 
AURKB, BRD4, and TEAD inhibition. We linked several of these vulnerabilities to 
gene regulatory changes, for example, TEAD vulnerability was consistent with 
evidence of Hippo pathway turning off in osimertinib DTPs. Last, we used genetic 
approaches using siRNA knockdown or CRISPR knockout to validate AURKB, BRD4, and 
TEAD as the direct targets responsible for the vulnerabilities observed in the 
drug screen."
385,"We previously reported that pentagamavunone-1 (PGV-1) effectively inhibited cell 
proliferation in many types of human tumors, including pancreatic cancer, by 
inducing M phase (prometaphase) arrest, senescence, and apoptosis with few side 
effects. However, a detailed evaluation of the effects of PGV-1 on pancreatic 
cancer cells in an in vivo setting has not yet been conducted. The present study 
investigated the potential efficacy of PGV-1 as both monotherapy and combination 
therapy for pancreatic cancer using multiple xenograft mouse assays. A cell-line 
derived xenograft model (CDX-M) with pancreatic cancer cell line and a 
patient-derived xenograft mouse model (PDX-M) using resected pancreatic cancer 
samples without neoadjuvant chemotherapy were established in both heterotopic 
and orthotopic manners. PGV-1 effectively suppressed tumor formation at the 
heterotopic and orthotopic sites in CDX-M than in untreated mice. Combination 
therapy with PGV-1 and gemcitabine more effectively suppressed tumor formation 
than monotherapy with PGV-1 or gemcitabine when administered after tumor 
formation. Monotherapy with PGV-1 or gemcitabine less effectively suppressed 
tumor formation in PDX-M than in CDX-M, whereas combination therapy with PGV-1 
and gemcitabine more effectively suppressed tumor formation. PGV-1 as 
monotherapy and combination therapy with gemcitabine effectively inhibited tumor 
formation and has potential as an anticancer candidate for pancreatic cancer."
386,"The chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein CHD8 is the most frequently 
mutated gene in autism spectrum disorder. Despite its prominent disease 
involvement, little is known about its molecular function in the human brain. 
CHD8 is a chromatin regulator which binds to the promoters of actively 
transcribed genes through genomic targeting mechanisms which have yet to be 
fully defined. By generating a conditional loss-of-function and an endogenously 
tagged allele in human pluripotent stem cells, we investigated the molecular 
function and the interaction of CHD8 with chromatin in human neurons. Chromatin 
accessibility analysis and transcriptional profiling revealed that CHD8 
functions as a transcriptional activator at its target genes in human neurons. 
Furthermore, we found that CHD8 chromatin targeting is cell context-dependent. 
In human neurons, CHD8 preferentially binds at ETS motif-enriched promoters. 
This enrichment is particularly prominent on the promoters of genes whose 
expression significantly changes upon the loss of CHD8. Indeed, among the ETS 
transcription factors, we identified ELK1 as being most highly correlated with 
CHD8 expression in primary human fetal and adult cortical neurons and most 
highly expressed in our stem cell-derived neurons. Remarkably, ELK1 was 
necessary to recruit CHD8 specifically to ETS motif-containing sites. These 
findings imply that ELK1 and CHD8 functionally cooperate to regulate gene 
expression and chromatin states at MAPK/ERK target genes in human neurons. Our 
results suggest that the MAPK/ERK/ELK1 axis potentially contributes to the 
pathogenesis caused by CHD8 mutations in human neurodevelopmental disorders."
387,"Automatic diagnosis of malignant prostate cancer patients from mpMRI has been 
studied heavily in the past years. Model interpretation and domain drift have 
been the main road blocks for clinical utilization. As an extension from our 
previous work we trained on a public cohort with 201 patients and the cropped 
2.5D slices of the prostate glands were used as the input, and the optimal model 
were searched in the model space using autoKeras. As an innovative move, 
peripheral zone (PZ) and central gland (CG) were trained and tested separately, 
the PZ detector and CG detector were demonstrated effective in highlighting the 
most suspicious slices out of a sequence, hopefully to greatly ease the workload 
for the physicians."
388,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) arises along the peripheral bile ducts 
and is often accompanied by a tumor microenvironment (TME) high in extracellular 
matrices (ECMs). In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether an ECM-rich TME 
favors iCCA progression. We identified ITGA2, which encodes collagen-binding 
integrin α2, to be differentially-expressed in iCCA tumors compared with 
adjacent normal tissues. Elevated ITGA2 is also positively-correlated with its 
ligand, collagen type I. Increased ITGA2 expression and its role in collagen 
type I binding was validated in vitro using four iCCA cell lines, compared with 
a non-cancerous, cholangiocyte cell line. Robust interaction of iCCA cells with 
collagen type I was abolished by either ITGA2 depletion or integrin 
α2β1-selective inhibitor treatment. In a phenotypic study, collagen type I 
significantly enhances clonogenic growth of HuCCA-1 and HuCCT-1 cells by three 
and sixfold, respectively. Inhibition of integrin α2 expression or its activity 
significantly blocks collagen type I-induced colony growth in both cell lines. 
Taken together, our data provide mechanistic evidence that collagen type I 
promotes growth of iCCA colonies through integrin α2 suggesting that the 
collagen type I-integrin α2 axis could be a promising target for cancer 
prevention and a therapeutic opportunity for this cancer."
389,"Selective elimination of tumors has always been the mainstay of oncology 
research. The on-going research underlying the cellular apoptotic mechanisms 
reveal caspases activation, especially the key effector caspase-3, as a 
personalized tumor-selective therapeutic strategy. Our continued research 
protocol has exploited new optimized Passerini α-acyloxy carboxamides as 
efficient apoptotic inducers via caspase-3/7 dependent mechanism with highly 
selective anticancer profiles. The adopted design rationale relied on excluding 
structural alerts of previous leads, while merging various pharmacophoric motifs 
of natural and synthetic caspase activators via optimized one-pot Passerini 
reaction conditions. The prepared compounds resulting from Passerini reaction 
were screened for their cytotoxic activities against colorectal Caco-2 and liver 
HepG-2 cancer cells compared to normal fibroblasts utilizing MTT assay. Notably, 
all compounds exhibited promising low-range submicromolar IC50 against the 
studied cancer cell lines, with outstanding tumor selectivity (SI values up to 
266). Hence, they were superior to 5-fluorouracil. Notably, 7a, 7g, and 7j 
conferred the highest potencies against Caco-2 and HepG-2 cells and were 
selected for further mechanistic studies. Caspas-3/7 activation assay of the hit 
compounds and flow cytometric analysis of the treated apoptotic cancer cells 
demonstrated their significant caspase activation potential (up to 4.2 folds) 
and apoptotic induction capacities (up to 58.7%). Further assessment of Bcl2 
expression was performed being a physiological caspase-3 substrate. Herein, the 
three studied Passerini adducts were able to downregulate Bcl2 in the treated 
Caco-2 cells. Importantly, the mechanistic studies results of the three hits 
echoed their preliminary MTT antiproliferative potencies data highlighting their 
caspase-3 dependent apoptotic induction. Finally, the in silico predicted 
physicochemical and pharmacokinetic profiles, as well as ligand efficiency 
metrics were drug-like."
390,"The prognosis of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive 
metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remained unsatisfactory currently, more anti-HER2 
agents are needed. Here we report a phase I study that evaluated the safety, 
activity, and biomarkers of LZM005, a HER2 antibody, used as a monotherapy or in 
combination with trastuzumab plus docetaxel in patients with HER2-positive MBC. 
From October 2017 to December 2019, 34 patients received LZM005 (14 monotherapy, 
20 combination therapy). No DLT was observed. The common adverse events (AEs) in 
phase Ia included diarrhea (21.4%), infusion reaction (21.4%), and 
hypertriglyceridemia (21.4%), while those in phase Ib were leukopenia (85.0%), 
neutropenia (75.0%), anemia (60.0%), diarrhea (60.0%), and rash/pruritus 
(50.0%). All AEs were manageable. In phase Ia, partial response (PR) was 
achieved in one case (1/14, overall response rate [ORR]: 7.1%); the disease 
control rate was 42.90% (6/14). In phase Ib, 11 patients (55.0%) achieved PR, 
and eight (40.0%) had stable disease. The ORR was 100% (6/6) in 
trastuzumab-naive and 35.7% (5/14) in trastuzumab-pretreated patients. Biomarker 
analysis showed that chromatin remodeling genes KMT2B and BRWD1 were associated 
with better progression-free survival. LZM005 is well tolerated and shows potent 
activity in patients with HER2-positive MBC."
391,"Nutrient-limiting conditions are common during cancer development. The 
coordination of cellular glucose levels and cell survival is a fundamental 
question in cell biology and has not been completely understood. 4EBP1 is known 
as a translational repressor to regulate cell proliferation and survival by 
controlling translation initiation, however, whether 4EBP1 could participate in 
tumor survival by other mechanism except for translational repression function, 
especially under glucose starvation conditions remains unknown. Here, we found 
that protein levels of 4EBP1 was up-regulated in the central region of the tumor 
which always suffered nutrient deprivation compared with the peripheral region. 
We further discovered that 4EBP1 was dephosphorylated by PTPMT1 under glucose 
starvation conditions, which prevented 4EBP1 from being targeted for 
ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation by HERC5. After that, 4EBP1 
translocated to cytoplasm and interacted with STAT3 by competing with JAK and 
ERK, leading to the inactivation of STAT3 in the cytoplasm, resulting in 
apoptosis under glucose withdrawal conditions. Moreover, 4EBP1 knockdown 
increased the tumor volume and weight in xenograft models by inhibiting 
apoptosis in the central region of tumor. These findings highlight a novel 
mechanism for 4EBP1 as a new cellular glucose sensor in regulating cancer cell 
death under glucose deprivation conditions, which was different from its 
classical function as a translational repressor."
392,"The progression of cancer from localized to metastatic disease is the primary 
cause of morbidity and mortality. The interplay between the tumor and its 
microenvironment is the key driver in this process of tumor progression. In 
order for tumors to progress and metastasize they must reprogram the cells that 
make up the microenvironment to promote tumor growth and suppress endogenous 
defense systems, such as the immune and inflammatory response. We have 
previously demonstrated that stimulation of Tsp-1 in the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) potently inhibits tumor growth and progression. Here, we identify a novel 
tumor-mediated mechanism that represses the expression of Tsp-1 in the TME via 
secretion of the serine protease PRSS2. We demonstrate that PRSS2 represses 
Tsp-1, not via its enzymatic activity, but by binding to low-density lipoprotein 
receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). These findings describe a hitherto 
undescribed activity for PRSS2 through binding to LRP1 and represent a potential 
therapeutic strategy to treat cancer by blocking the PRSS2-mediated repression 
of Tsp-1. Based on the ability of PRSS2 to reprogram the tumor microenvironment, 
this discovery could lead to the development of therapeutic agents that are 
indication agnostic."
393,"Ferroptosis is a type of regulated necrosis caused by unrestricted lipid 
peroxidation and subsequent plasma membrane rupture. However, the lipid 
remodeling mechanism that determines sensitivity to ferroptosis remains poorly 
understood. Here, we report a previously unrecognized role for the lipid 
flippase solute carrier family 47 member 1 (SLC47A1) as a regulator of lipid 
remodeling and survival during ferroptosis. Among 49 phospholipid scramblases, 
flippases, and floppases we analyzed, only SLC47A1 had mRNA that was selectively 
upregulated in multiple cancer cells exposed to ferroptotic inducers. 
Large-scale lipidomics and functional analyses revealed that the silencing of 
SLC47A1 increased RSL3- or erastin-induced ferroptosis by favoring 
ACSL4-SOAT1-mediated production of polyunsaturated fatty acid cholesterol 
esters. We identified peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARA) 
as a transcription factor that transactivates SLC47A1. The depletion of PPARA 
and SLC47A1 similarly sensitized cells to ferroptosis induction, whereas 
transfection-enforced re-expression of SLC47A1 restored resistance to 
ferroptosis in PPARA-deficient cells. Pharmacological or genetic blockade of the 
PPARA-SLC47A1 pathway increased the anticancer activity of a ferroptosis inducer 
in mice. These findings establish a direct molecular link between ferroptosis 
and lipid transporters, which may provide metabolic targets for overcoming drug 
resistance."
394,"This study aimed to investigate the impact of sub epidermal moisture (SEM) 
measurement and targeted pressure ulcer (PU) prevention, versus visual skin 
assessment and usual care, on mean SEM delta scores and early pressure ulcer 
development in acute hospital patients. A quantitative quasi-experimental 
observational approach was used. A total of 149 at risk acute hospital patients 
took part, 78 treatment, and 71 control. SEM deltas were recorded daily for a 
maximum of 5 days using the SEM Scanner (Bruin Biometrics LLC, Los Angeles, 
California), on three sites: the sacrum, the right heel, and the left heel, with 
enhanced and targeted PU prevention interventions occurring in those with an 
elevated SEM delta scores in the treatment group. Intention to treat analysis 
was used to guide the final composition of results. SEM PU represents PU 
development as identified by 2 days of sustained abnormal SEM delta scores, 
≥0.5, after day one. The mean number of days completed by participants was just 
under 4 days, participants had many different comorbidities, with the most 
common being: hypertension, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Results showed that following the introduction of SEM guided targeted 
treatments, participants in the treatment group yielded a statistically 
significant reduction in mean SEM delta scores (MD: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.39; 
P < .0001), and in the odds of developing a SEM PU (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.24 to 
1.00; P = .05). In the treatment group, none of the participants developed a 
visual PU, whereas, in the control group, 1.41% (n = 1/71) developed a visual 
PU. Based on all the results, the following is concluded, (1). There was a 
greater reduction in mean SEM delta scores among those cared for using SEM 
measurement and targeted PU prevention, versus those cared for using visual skin 
assessment and usual care, and (2). the mean SEM delta scores was statistically 
significantly lower at the study end for those who received targeted treatments 
based on abnormal SEM scores. More research is now needed in other and larger 
at-risk groups to further validate what was found in this study."
395,"OBJECTIVE: Time-restricted eating (TRE) can reduce body weight, but it is 
unclear how it influences dietary patterns and behavior. Therefore, this study 
assessed the effects of TRE on diet quality, appetite, and several eating 
behaviors.
METHODS: Adults with obesity were randomized to early TRE plus energy 
restriction (eTRE + ER; 8-hour eating window from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.) or a 
control eating schedule plus energy restriction (CON + ER; ≥12-hour window) for 
14 weeks. Food intake was assessed via the Remote Food Photography Method, while 
eating patterns, appetite, and eating behaviors were assessed via 
questionnaires.
RESULTS: A total of 59 participants completed the trial, of whom 45 had valid 
food records. eTRE + ER did not affect eating frequency, eating restraint, 
emotional eating, or the consistency of mealtimes relative to CON + ER. 
eTRE + ER also did not affect overall diet quality. The intensity and frequency 
of hunger and fullness were similar between groups, although the eTRE + ER group 
was hungrier while fasting.
CONCLUSIONS: When combined with a weight-loss program, eTRE does not affect diet 
quality, meal frequency, eating restraint, emotional eating, or other eating 
behaviors relative to eating over more than a 12-hour window. Rather, 
participants implement eTRE as a simple timing rule by condensing their normal 
eating patterns into a smaller eating window."
396,"Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of lipids in biological tissues is useful for 
correlating molecular distribution with pathological results, which could 
provide useful information for both biological research and disease diagnosis. 
It is well understood that the lipidome could not be clearly deciphered without 
tandem mass spectrometry analysis, but this is challenging to achieve in MSI due 
to the limitation in sample amount at each image spot. Here we develop a 
multiplexed MS2 imaging (MS2I) method that can provide MS2 images for 10 lipid 
species or more for each sampling spot, providing spatial structural lipidomic 
information. Coupling with on-tissue photochemical derivatization, imaging of 20 
phospholipid C=C location isomers is also realized, showing enhanced molecular 
images with high definition in structure for mouse brain and human liver cancer 
tissue sections. Spatially mapped t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding 
has also been adopted to visualize the tumor margin with enhancement by 
structural lipidomic information."
397,"Cancer incidence and mortality rates are increasing in West Africa. Cancer is a 
recent discipline in Mali and the means available to treat patients are 
insufficient. Mali has only one radiotherapy machine for the country and its 
malfunctions are regularly reported in the media. In order to understand the 
recurrent dissatisfactions linked to access to radiotherapy in Mali, we retraced 
the history of this machine and described its functioning. Based on 
semi-directive interviews with patients&#8217; associations and health 
professionals involved in cancer care in Bamako, we describe how radiotherapy in 
Mali reveals global health issues through the intervention of numerous 
international cooperations. In addition, based on data collection from medical 
registers and institutional reports, we report that the average time to get a 
radiotherapy appointment is 3 to 6 months in Mali, but also that the 
radiotherapy machine has experienced 198 breakdowns between April 3, 2014 and 
September 24, 2021, which represents more than 54&#160;weeks of cumulative 
downtime. Radiotherapy is a crucial element in the treatment of cancer and the 
lack of access to this treatment worsens the vital diagnosis of patients. While 
the Malian government is committed to universal health coverage reforms, 
strengthening cancer treatment facilities should also be considered a public 
health priority for Mali."
398,"BACKGROUND: Cancer and its treatments have the potential to significantly impact 
mental health, provoking feelings of anxiety, depression, and distress, which 
can last long after treatment is over. One of the most rapidly emerging 
influences in the healthcare field is mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), 
which are designed to cultivate present moment awareness, attentional 
flexibility, compassion and acceptance, to reduce physical and psychological 
distress. However, there is limited research into the efficacy of MBIs or 
disease specific MBIs in shifting negative coping, ruminative thinking and fears 
of compassion as primary outcomes in individuals with cancer.
AIMS: This exploratory study was designed to evaluate inter- and 
intra-individual change in the management of negative coping, rumination and 
fears of compassion, following a cancer-specific mindfulness-based intervention.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A single group, non-experimental, repeated measures study 
of 22 participants across six cancer care centres explored the efficacy of an 
8-week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Cancer (MBCT-Ca) course. The 
Reliable Change Index (RCI) examined reliable clinical improvement, 
deterioration, or no change in individuals on the Mental Adjustment to Cancer 
Scale (MACS), the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) and the Fears of Compassion 
Scale (FCS). About 82% of participants (n = 18) saw an improvement in at least 
one measure. A significant decrease in primary outcome scores was observed in 
negative coping, ruminating and fears of self-compassion. There were significant 
correlations between the fear of self-compassion and depressive ruminating, fear 
of accepting compassion from others and showing it to others pre and post 
intervention.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the MBCT-Ca programme may significantly 
reduce negative coping, ruminating and fears of self-compassion improving 
psychological health and wellbeing in cancer survivors."
399,"BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, rates of risk-reducing prophylactic mastectomy 
(PM) have risen dramatically. A topic of debate regarding the procedure is 
whether to use sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) at the time of PM and what 
factors might predict for such need. In order to assess the rate of identifying 
presence of occult invasive breast cancer in the PM specimen, we performed a 
retrospective review of the pathology findings from a single-surgeon case-series 
of PM.
METHODS: Patients undergoing PM between January 2013 and June 2019 at Orlando 
Health Cancer Institute were identified for a retrospective chart review. 
Demographic, clinical, and histopathological data from the surgical procedure 
were collected and analyzed for the incidence of occult invasive breast cancer 
in the PM specimen.
RESULTS: A total of 146 consecutive patients with PM were identified; 120 
(82.2%) underwent contralateral PM (CPM) and 26 (17.8%) underwent bilateral PM 
(BPM). Final pathology of the 172 PM specimens identified 4 (3.3%) with lobular 
carcinoma in situ, 3 (2.5%) with atypical ductal hyperplasia, and 2 (1.7%) with 
atypical lobular hyperplasia and 2 (1.7%) with intraductal papilloma. No 
invasive malignancy was detected in any of the 172 PM specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of occult invasive carcinoma in 172 consecutive PM 
specimens suggests a limited clinical utility in routinely performing SLNB in 
this setting. This study also suggests that use of preoperative breast MRI 
imaging could offer a potential non-invasive tool to detect occult malignancy 
and select patients who can safely undergo omission of SLNB at the time of PM."
400,"Pressure injury often seriously affects the life quality of aged patients, 
especially the long-term bedridden casualties. Widely adopted by different 
disciplines, negative pressure suction has its role in pressure injury. 
Microskin implantation has been demonstrated powerful in increasing the 
expansion ratio of donor area-derived skin and accelerating wound healing by 
forming ""skin islands"". The study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of additional use of bedside microskin implantation in the palliative 
care of pressure injury of aged patients who cannot tolerate surgical treatment 
as a supplement for standard negative pressure suction. An open-label 
within-patient RCT was conducted in aged patients with pressure injury. Sixteen 
patients were enrolled. After granulation tissues formed, half of a pressure 
injury was randomised to receive the negative pressure suction as the control 
group, and the other half exposed to additional bedside microskin implantation 
as the experimental group. Efficacy was evaluated within 1 month after 
treatment, and the primary endpoints included the wound healing rate and 
pressure ulcer scale for healing (PUSH) scores. The secondary outcomes included 
survival rate of implanted microskin, pain intensity assessment, satisfaction 
surveys from patients or their family, and pressure ulcer healing complications. 
Sixteen patients completed the study. After 14 days of operation, 5.63 ± 1.78 
out of 10 pieces of implanted microskin survived and formed neonatal epithelium. 
The wound healing rates of the control group and the experimental group at 
1 month were (26.17 ± 9.03%) and (35.95 ± 16.02%), respectively (P < .01). The 
mean PUSH score before the surgery was 12.38 ± 2.23. At 1 month after surgery, 
the mean difference of PUSH score from baseline was 2.13 ± 0.96 in the control 
group and 2.81 ± 0.83 in the experimental group (P < .01). The treatment of 
microskin implantation did not cause additional pain or complications to the 
patients. Accompanied by a better ulcer status, the majority of patients or 
their guardians have a high degree of acceptance towards the microskin 
implantation. Bedside microskin implantation could accelerate wound healing with 
lower PUSH scores. As a complementary palliative treatment, supplementary 
microskin implantation is effective and well tolerated."
401,"In this case report is discussed the diagnosis of papillary carcinoma in the 
case of a patient in whose age the occurrence of the disease is very rare. The 
patient underwent a series of non-invasive and invasive examinations, the 
results of which eventually led to a surgical solution of the suspected lesion 
(Wipples procedure). Histological examination of the resection confirmed mixed 
type ampular adenocarcinoma. In the context of this finding, the results of the 
examination, their information value, interpretation and mutual interaction are 
discussed. In the postoperative period, the patient suffered from 
gastrointestinal bleeding, subileum and poor postoperative healing. After 
hospitalization, the patient was transferred to oncology care and indicated for 
genetic testing."
402,"The available literature suggests that the most significant barriers to 
undergoing colonoscopy in general include &#8220;fear of pain and 
discomfort&#8221;, &#8220;fear of bowel preparation&#8221;, as well as directly 
unrelated influences such as &#8220;lack of support from family and 
friends&#8221;, &#8220;busy family and work schedules&#8221;, &#8220;other 
health problems&#8221; and the current &#8220;fear of getting COVID-19 in 
hospital&#8221;. A marital union may play a positive role, previous cancer a 
negative one. Another important factor is that patients are not used to talking 
about their barriers spontaneously; a guided conversation is a useful tool. 
Respondents in this qualitative study addressed these barriers as significant in 
their answers."
403,"Ethanol ablation of recurrent symptomatic thyroid cystic nodules is a minimally 
invasive procedure that can be used as an alternative to surgery. The method is

404,"Variations in telomere length (TL) have been associated with aging, stress, and 
many diseases. Placenta TL is an essential molecular component influencing the 
outcome of birth. Previous investigations into the relationship between placenta 
TL and preeclampsia (PE) have produced conflicting findings. We conducted a 
retrospective case-control analysis in this study to address the disparity. We 
used placenta samples from 224 births received from Hawaii Biorepository (HiBR) 
between 2006 and 2013, comprising 129 healthy full-term controls and 95 severe 
PE samples. The average absolute placental TL was calculated using the 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technique. We utilized multiple 
linear regressions to associate placental TL with severe PE and other 
demographic, clinical and physiological data. The outcome demonstrates that the 
placental TL of severe PE cases did not significantly differ from that of 
healthy controls. Instead, there is a strong correlation between gestational age 
and placenta TL shortening. Placental TL also exhibits racial differences: (1) 
Latino moms' TL is significantly longer than non-Latino mothers' (p=0.009). (2) 
Caucasian patients with severe PE have shorter TL than non-Caucasian patients 
(p=0.0037). This work puts the long-standing question of whether severe PE 
influences placental TL to rest. Placental TL is not related to severe PE but is 
negatively associated with gestational age and is also affected by race."
405,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an ER-localized transmembrane protein 
and the receptor for 2',3'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate&endash;adenosine 
monophosphate (cGAMP), which is a second messenger produced by cGAMP synthase 
(cGAS), a cytosolic double-stranded DNA sensor. The cGAS-STING pathway plays a 
critical role in the innate immune response to infection of a variety of DNA 
pathogens through the induction of the type I interferons. Pharmacological 
activation of STING is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, thus the 
development of potent and selective STING agonists has been pursued. Here we 
report that mouse STING can be activated by phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a membrane 
permeable trivalent arsenic compound that preferentially reacts with thiol group 
of cysteine residue (Cys). The activation of STING with PAO does not require 
cGAS or cGAMP. Mass spectrometric analysis of the peptides generated by trypsin 
and chymotrypsin digestion of STING identifies several PAO adducts, suggesting 
that PAO covalently binds to STING. Screening of STING variants with single Cys 
to serine residues (Ser) reveals that Cys88 and Cys291 are critical to the 
response to PAO. STING activation with PAO, as with cGAMP, requires the 
ER-to-Golgi traffic and palmitoylation of STING. Our results identify a 
non-nucleotide STING agonist that does not target the cGAMP-binding pocket, and 
demonstrate that Cys of STING can be a novel target for the development of STING 
agonist.Key words: STING agonist, cysteine modification, innate immunity, 
phenylarsine oxide."
406,"PURPOSE: Dysregulated circular RNAs (circRNAs) have shown crucial modulatory 
functions in tumorigenesis, containing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The 
purpose of this study was to explore the biological functions and regulatory 
theory of circ_0006220 in NSCLC.
METHODS: Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and 
Western blot assay were conducted to measure RNA and protein expression, 
respectively. A total of 73 cases of NSCLC tumor samples were collected for 
expression analysis, and A-549 and NCI-H1299 cell lines were used for functional 
experiments. Cell proliferation was assessed by cell counting kit-8 assay, 
colony formation assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, and flow cytometry. 
Cell apoptosis, motility, and angiogenesis ability were analyzed by flow 
cytometry, transwell assays, and capillary-like network formation assay. 
Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were conducted 
to verify the target relationships.
RESULTS: Circ_0006220 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. 
Circ_0006220 silencing inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and 
angiogenesis but induced the apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Circ_0006220 acted as a 
microRNA-342-3p (miR-342-3p) sponge, and circ_0006220 knockdown-induced changes 
on the phenotypes of NSCLC cells were largely overturned by the knockdown of 
miR-342-3p. miR-342-3p interacted with the 3' untranslated region of 
glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2), and GOT2 overexpression largely 
diminished miR-342-3p overexpression-mediated influences in NSCLC cells. 
Circ_0006220 could up-regulate GOT2 expression by sponging miR-342-3p.
CONCLUSION: Circ_0006220 promoted the malignant behaviors of NSCLC cells through 
mediating the miR-342-3p/GOT2 regulation cascade."
407,"Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) usually involves bone marrow (BM) and sometimes 
lymph nodes and spleen. LPL presenting as a hepatic mass lesion is extremely 
rare, with only one case reported in the English literature. A 70-year-old 
Japanese female presented to us with a right hypochondriac mass with tenderness. 
Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 14 cm-sized bulky hepatic mass. Laboratory 
findings showed a normal white blood cell count of 4.1×109/L with 4% 
plasmacytoid lymphocytes; normocytic anemia, Hb 9.4 g/dL; high soluble IL-2 
receptor level, 2,290 U/mL; and elevated IgG, 10,306 mg/dL. Furthermore, IgG-κ 
monoclonal protein was detected. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission 
tomography/CT revealed abnormal uptake in the liver mass; left supraclavicular, 
parasternal, abdominal, and left inguinal lymph nodes; and bilateral lung bases. 
Magnetic resonance imaging showed no bone lesions. BM aspiration and liver 
biopsy showed predominant infiltration of small lymphocytes admixed with 
plasmacytoid lymphocytes and plasma cells. In the liver specimen, 
lymphoepithelial lesions were not observed. The small lymphocytes were positive 
for CD20, CD79a, and bcl-2, and negative for CD5, CD10, cyclin D1, and IRTA1; 
plasma cells in BM were positive for CD19, CD45, IgG, and κ-chain, and negative 
for CD20, and CD56. MYD88 L265P mutation, reported in approximately 40% of 
non-IgM LPL cases, was not detected in the liver specimen and BM cells. The 
frequency is lower than that of typical IgM LPL. These findings led us to a 
diagnosis of LPL with IgG-κ paraproteinemia. The patient underwent four courses 
of R-CHOP and two courses of Bendamustine-R. Partial remission was achieved."
408,"3q27 chromosomal translocation involving the BCL6 gene is one of the most 
frequent forms of cytogenetic abnormality observed in B-cell lymphoma. We report 
a case with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) presenting dual 3q27 
translocations. The patient was a 71-year-old man who presented with swelling of 
multiple abdominal lymph nodes (LNs) and obstructive jaundice. LN biopsy 
exhibited dense proliferation of atypical large cells expressing CD20, 
MUM1/IRF4, BCL2, BCL6, and MYC, but not CD10. He was diagnosed with non-GCB/ABC 
type DLBCL and showed an initially good response to R-CHOP chemotherapy, but 
relapsed soon after the completion of therapy. Chromosomal analysis of the 
biopsied LN exhibited multiple abnormalities including t(3;14)(q27;q32) and 
t(3;22)(q27;q11). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using BCL6 
break-apart probes confirmed chromosomal breaks occurring on both BCL6 alleles. 
Molecular analysis revealed two independent rearrangements of BCL6, either with 
the IGH or the IGL gene. 3q27 breakpoints were located 1.2kb apart from each 
other within the first intron of BCL6, while the IGH and IGL breaks occurred at 
the 5' of IGHG2 and within IGLV3-1, respectively. The results suggest that 
biallelic BCL6 rearrangements might be a rare but recurrent genetic event in 
B-cell lymphoma."
409,"We describe two follicular lymphoma (FL) patients with MYC/BCL2 double- and 
MYC/BCL2/BCL6 triple-hit translocations. The first patient (case 1) was a man in 
his 30s who presented with stage IV disease with leukemic manifestation. The 
second patient (case 2) was a man in his 60s who presented with relapsed FL, but 
his disease was in a limited stage. Histopathology of the lymph node biopsies 
revealed grade 3A FL in both cases. MYC positivity and the Ki-67-labeling index 
were 60-70 and 20% in case 1 and 30 and 50% in case 2, respectively. G-banding 
revealed t(8;14;18)(q24;q32;q21) in both cases and fluorescence in situ 
hybridization using MYC, IGH, and BCL2 break-apart probes confirmed 
t(8;14;18)(+5'BCL2,-3'MYC;+3'MYC,-5'IGH;+5'IGH,-5'BCL2). In case 2, additional 
materials of der(8)t(8;14;18) were duplicated and translocated to chromosome Y, 
and t(3;16)(q27;p13)/BCL6::CIITA was identified. We obtained BCL2-major 
breakpoint region::IGHJ5::IGHG1 and MYC exon 2::IGHA2 fusion sequences by 
long-distance polymerase chain reaction in case 1, and proposed that t(8;14;18) 
was generated by two-step translocations and that BCL2::IGH and MYC::IGH 
involved the same IGH allele. Both patients responded to the standard 
chemotherapy for FL. We suggest that the presence of t(8;14;18) in FL does not 
immediately indicate high-grade transformation and aggressive clinical behavior 
requiring intensive chemotherapy."
410,"Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare malignancy showing morphologic and 
immunophenotypic features of histiocytes. HS has morphologic overlap with many 
other diseases, including various kinds of lymphomas. Gray zone lymphoma (GZL) 
is a rare B-cell lymphoma subtype characterized by overlapping features between 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classic Hodgkin lymphoma. The histologic 
overlap with other diverse diseases of HS and the pathological diversity of GZL 
make it difficult to render a diagnosis. A 44-year-old woman who was initially 
diagnosed with HS was diagnosed with GZL after reexamination, including a 
genetic alteration test. After 6 cycles of brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, 
vinblastine, and dacarbazine, she achieved a complete response. Genomic 
alteration assessment may be useful for the accurate diagnosis of malignant 
lymphomas, which are difficult to diagnose, such as GZL."
411,"In this study, we examined a cohort of Japanese patients with acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) with cup-like nuclei. In particular, we attempted to provide a 
detailed definition of the clinical features of AML with cup-like nuclei. The 
clinical records of patients diagnosed with de novo AML were collected 
retrospectively. We showed that approximately 23% of all patients with AML 
diagnosed during the study period had AML with cup-like nuclei. All three 
cup-like AML cases had FLT3-ITD mutations. In addition, we reported a high 
incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and acute cerebral 
infarction in patients with AML with cup-like nuclei. Our results show that AML 
with cup-like nuclei may be more common than expected. Due to these unique 
characteristics, recognition of this morphology is recommended."
412,"The cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) regimen, 
containing doxorubicin (DXR), which is a key drug for aggressive non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL), is a standard chemotherapeutic regimen; however, its 
administration in elderly patients is often intolerable. Pirarubicin 
(tetrahydropyranyl adriamycin [THP]) is an anthracycline developed in Japan. We 
have conducted a phase II trial of a full-dose THP-COP (modified CHOP regimen 
with DXR replaced by THP) regimen for elderly patients with newly diagnosed, 
advanced-stage, aggressive NHL. Patients aged 70-79 years old with previously 
untreated NHL according to the Working Formulation (D through H and J), disease 
stage I with a bulky mass or stage II-IV, and performance status of 0-1 were 
eligible. The THP-COP regimen, which consisted of 750-mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, 
50-mg/m2 THP, 1.4-mg/m2 vincristine (capped at 2.0 mg) on day 1, and 100-mg 
prednisolone daily on days 1 to 5, was delivered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. The 
primary endpoint was complete response (CR) rate. Twenty-nine patients were 
enrolled in the study. The CR rate was 65.5% (95% confidence interval, 
45.7-82.1%). The 3-year failure-free and overall survival rates were 54.1% and 
53.9%, respectively. The most frequent observed grade 3 or 4 toxicity was 
neutropenia, which occurred in 80% of the patients. Grade 3 cardiac dysfunction 
was observed in one patient. The full-dose THP-COP regimen exhibited similar 
efficacy and safety, and a tendency for less cardiac toxicity, when compared 
with the standard CHOP regimen in elderly Japanese patients with newly 
diagnosed, advanced-stage, aggressive NHL."
413,"Aberrant DNA methylation is one of the earliest hallmarks of cancer. DNMT1 is 
responsible for methylating newly replicated DNA, but the precise regulation of 
DNMT1 to ensure faithful DNA methylation remains poorly understood. A link 
between RNA and chromatin-associated proteins has recently emerged, and several 
studies have shown that DNMT1 can be regulated by a variety of RNAs. In this 
study we have confirmed that human DNMT1 indeed interacts with multiple RNAs, 
including its own nuclear mRNA. Unexpectedly, we found that DNMT1 exhibits a 
strong and specific affinity for GU-rich RNAs that form a pUG-fold, a 
non-canonical G-quadruplex. We find that pUG-fold-capable RNAs inhibit DNMT1 
activity by inhibiting binding of hemimethylated DNA, and additionally provide 
evidence for multiple RNA binding modes with DNMT1. Together, our data indicates 
that a human chromatin-associated protein binds to and is regulated by pUG-fold 
RNA."

416,"BACKGROUND: The role of cancer-directed surgery in the treatment of stage I-IIIA 
malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) by histologic subtypes remains 
controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the survival of the 
different histologic subtypes for stage I-IIIA MPM stratified by cancer-directed 
surgery and nonoperative management.
RESEARCH QUESTION: How is the histologic subtype, clinical stage, and use of 
cancer-directed surgery with MPM associated with overall survival?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Overall survival of patients with stage I-IIIA 
epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and biphasic MPM in the National Cancer Database from 
2004-2017 who underwent cancer-directed surgery (i.e., surgery with or without 
chemotherapy + radiation) or chemotherapy with or without radiation 
('nonoperative management') was evaluated using KaplanMeier analysis, 
multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis, and propensity score-matched 
analysis.
RESULTS: Of 2,285 patients with stage I-IIIA MPM who met inclusion criteria, 
histologic subtype was epithelioid in 71% of patients, sarcomatoid in 12% of 
patients, and biphasic in 17% of patients. Median survival was 20 months in the 
epithelioid group, 8 months in the sarcomatoid group, and 13 months in the 
biphasic group (P < 0.01). Among patients who underwent surgery, median survival 
was 25 months in the epithelioid group, 8 months in the sarcomatoid group, and 
15 months in the biphasic group (P < 0.01). In multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards analyses, surgery was associated with improved survival in the 
epithelioid group (P < 0.01) but not in the sarcomatoid (P = 0.63) or biphasic 
(P = 0.21) groups. These findings were consistent in propensity score-matched 
analyses for each MPM histology.
INTERPRETATION: In this national analysis, cancer-directed surgery was found to 
be associated with improved survival for stage I-IIIA epithelioid MPM but not 
for biphasic or sarcomatoid MPM."
417,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a globally prevalent pathogen, 
annually resulting in 20 million infections, 3 million cases of clinical 
disease, and 60,000 fatalities worldwide, significantly endangering pregnant 
women and immunocompromised individuals. HEV-related research has been 
considerably delayed, and no HEV-specific therapeutics have yet been developed. 
We aimed to discover efficient anti-HEV drugs through high throughput screening 
that could be validated in vitro and in a preclinical animal study in vivo, and 
elucidate the underlying antiviral mechanism.
METHODS: Using appropriate cellular and rodent HEV infection models, we studied 
a critical pathway for host-HEV interaction and performed a preclinical study of 
the corresponding antivirals by targeting proteostasis of the HEV replicase.
RESULTS: We found 17 inhibitors that target HEV-HSP90 interactions by an 
unbiased compound library screening on human hepatocytes harboring an HEV 
replicon. Inhibitors of HSP90 (iHSP90) markedly suppressed HEV replication with 
efficacy exceeding that of conventional antivirals (IFNα and ribavirin) in 
vitro. Mechanistically, iHSP90 treatment released the viral replicase ORF1 
protein from the ORF1-HSP90 complex and triggered ORF1 for rapid 
ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation, resulting in abrogated HEV 
replication. Furthermore, a preclinical trial in a Mongolian gerbil HEV 
infection model showed this novel anti-HEV strategy to be safe, efficient, and 
able to prevent HEV-induced liver damage.
CONCLUSIONS: This study collectively illustrates a critical proteostasis pathway 
for host-HEV interaction and paves the way for translating the new understanding 
of the HEV life cycle into clinically promising antivirals.
IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Appropriate treatment options for HEV-infected pregnant 
women as well as immunocompromised patients are lacking, creating an urgent need 
for developing safe HEV-specific therapies. This study identified new antivirals 
(inhibitors of HSP90) that significantly decrease the HEV infection by targeting 
viral replicase for degradation. Moreover, these anti-HEV drugs were validated 
in an HEV rodent model and found to be safe and efficient for prevention of 
HEV-induced liver injury in preclinical experiments. Our findings substantially 
promote the understanding of HEV pathobiology and the pace of antiviral 
development."
418,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the risk of multiple recurrences in intermediate-risk 
non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (IR-NMIBC) and their impact on progression. 
Prognostic studies of IR-NMIBC have focused on initial recurrences, yet little 
is known about subsequent recurrences and their impact on progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: IR-NMIBC patients from the Be-Well Study, a prospective 
cohort study of NMIBC patients diagnosed from 2015-2019 at Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California, were identified. The frequency of first, second, and third 
intravesical recurrences of urothelial carcinoma were characterized using 
conditional Kaplan-Meier analyses and random-effects shared-frailty models. The 
association of multiple recurrences with progression was examined.
RESULTS: In 291 patients with IR-NMIBC (median follow-up 38 months), the 5-year 
risk of initial recurrence was 54.4%. After initial recurrence (n=137), 60.1% of 
patients had a second recurrence by 2 years. After second recurrence (n=70), 
51.5% of patients had a third recurrence by 3 years. In multivariable analysis, 
female sex (Hazard Ratio 1.51, p<0.01), increasing tumor size (HR 1.14, p<0.01) 
and number of prior recurrences (HR 1.24, p<0.01) were associated with multiple 
recurrences; whereas maintenance BCG (HR 0.66, p=0.03) was associated with 
reduced recurrences. The 5-year risk of progression varied significantly 
(p<0.01) by number of recurrences: 9.5%, 21.9%, and 37.9% for patients with 1, 
2, and 3+ recurrences, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple recurrences are common in IR-NMIBC and are associated with 
progression. Female sex, larger tumors, number of prior recurrences, and lack of 
maintenance BCG were associated with multiple recurrences. Multiple recurrences 
may prove useful as a clinical trial endpoint for IR-NMIBC."
419,"BACKGROUND: Uterine cancers are associated with a high risk of venous 
thromboembolism. The American Society of Clinical Oncology practice guidelines 
recommend all patients undergoing pelvic surgery for cancer receive extended 
pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with the duration dependent on risk. However, 
risk stratification for patients with uterine cancer is not clearly defined. The 
Caprini score is the most widely used risk assessment model but it has been 
found to have limited utility in the gynecologic oncology population. A modified 
Caprini score has been explored in other populations. The Khorana score is an 
additional risk assessment model which has not been studied in this context.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the ability of a modified Caprini model 
as well as the Khorana score to risk stratify patients with uterine cancer for 
postoperative venous thromboembolism within 90 days of surgery.
STUDY DESIGN: Following IRB approval, a retrospective cohort study was performed 
and all patients with uterine cancer who underwent a hysterectomy over a 4-year 
period were included. The Caprini and Khorana scores were calculated for each 
patient. The Caprini score cutoff for highest risk was evaluated at ≥7, ≥8 and 
≥9 (""modified Caprini"") and the Khorana score cutoff was evaluated at ≥2 and ≥3. 
To determine the prognostic utility of each score as well as other 
clinico-pathologic criteria on development of venous thromboembolism, univariate 
analysis was performed using independent t test, chi-square test or Fisher's 
exact test; multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 954 patients were included, the rate of venous 
thromboembolism was 1.7% (16/954). Minimally invasive surgical approach was 
utilized in 90.5% (863/954) of patients. The mean Caprini score of patients with 
venous thromboembolism was 10.3 compared to 8.1 for the patients without 
(p<0.0001, 95%CI 1.17-3.33). The mean Khorana score of the venous 
thromboembolism group was 2.4 versus 1.9 (p=0.03, 95%CI 0.04-0.82). Both the 
Caprini and Khorana scores were found to be associated with venous 
thromboembolism, but only a Caprini score with cutoff ≥8 or ≥9 was statistically 
significant (RR 31.25, 95%CI 1.88-519.49; RR 4.59, 95%CI 1.49-14.13 
respectively), with high accuracy based on area under the curve (0.75 and 0.68, 
respectively). Of the minimally invasive subgroup, 11.7% (101/863) had same-day 
discharge with no postoperative thromboprophylaxis; none of these patients 
developed venous thromboembolism. Despite laparotomy patients receiving extended 
prophylaxis (30 days), the rate of venous thromboembolism was more than three 
times that of the minimally invasive group (5.49% vs 1.7%). Advanced stage and 
leukocytosis were noted to be independent risk factors for venous 
thromboembolism.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that using a modified Caprini score could help 
identify the highest risk patients who would benefit from prolonged 
thromboprophylaxis, reduce the incidence of postoperative venous thromboembolism 
as well as minimize the cost and harm of overtreatment. These findings need to 
be validated in a prospective manner and further research is needed to determine 
the optimal duration of therapy."
420,"The changes in gut microbiota have been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC). 
The interplays between the host and gut microbiota remain largely unclear, and 
few studies have investigated these interplays using integrative multi-omics 
data. In this study, large-scale multi-comic datasets, including microbiome, 
metabolome, bulk transcriptomics and single cell RNA sequencing of CRC patients, 
were analyzed individually and integrated through advanced bioinformatics 
methods. We further examined the clinical relevance of these findings in the 
mice recolonized with microbiota from human. We found that CRC patients had 
distinct microbiota compositions compared to healthy controls. A 
machine-learning model was developed with 28 biomarkers for detection of CRC, 
which had high accuracy and clinical applicability. We identified multiple 
significant correlations between genera and well-characterized genes, suggesting 
the potential role of gut microbiota in tumor immunity. Further analysis showed 
that specific metabolites worked as profound communicators between these genera 
and tumor immunity. Integrating microbiota and metabolome perspectives, we 
catalogued gut taxonomic and metabolomic features that represented the key 
multi-omics signature of CRC. Furthermore, gut microbiota from CRC patients 
transplanted to compromise the response of CRC to immunotherapy. These 
phenotypes were strongly associated with the alterations in gut microbiota, 
immune cell infiltration as well as multiple metabolic pathways. The 
comprehensive interplays across multi-comic data of CRC might explain how gut 
microbiota influenced tumor immunity. Hence, we proposed that modifying the CRC 
microbiota using healthy donors might serve as a promising strategy to improve 
response to immunotherapy."
421,"INTRODUCTION: The Paris classification highlights the need to focus on 
accurately identifying high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC). Herein, we aimed

METHODS: All urinary cytology reports from July 2018 to December 2019 were 
collected (n = 1,240). Only voided urine samples were included (n = 1,180). Risk 
of high-grade malignancy (ROHM) was calculated for each Paris category. The 
diagnostic performance of urinary cytology was assessed, including sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), 
and accuracy.
RESULTS: The distribution of categories was: 0.3% unsatisfactory, 90.5% negative 
for HGUC, 5.6% atypical urothelial cells (AUC), 1.6% suspicious for HGUC, 1.9% 
HGUC, and 0.1% other malignancies. No diagnosis of low-grade urothelial 
neoplasia was given. The ROHM was 21.4% for negative for HGUC, 66.7% for AUC, 
91.7% for suspicious for HGUC, and 100% for HGUC. When using suspicious for HGUC 
as a cutoff, the diagnostic performance of urinary cytology in identifying HGUC 
histology was 46% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 96% PPV, 68% NPV, and 74% 
accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Specificity of urinary cytology was very high (with only 1 
false-positive result), which is important since this will trigger a clinical 
intervention. The ROHM for each category was in accordance with literature, 
except for AUC where ROHM was slightly higher (66.7%). This may be explained by 
the study population characteristics (cancer center; many patients treated with 
intravesical therapies; lack of clinical annotation for patients referred from 
outside institutions)."
422,"mRNA-based medicines are a promising modality for preventing virus-caused 
illnesses, including COVID-19, and treating various types of cancer and genetic 
diseases. To develop such medicines, methods to characterize long mRNA molecules 
are needed for quality control and metabolic analysis. Here, we developed an 
analytical platform based on isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS) that quantitatively characterizes long, modified mRNAs by 
comparing them to a stable isotope-labeled reference with an identical sequence 
to that of the target medicine. This platform also includes database searching 
using the mass spectra as a query, which allowed us to confirm the primary 
structures of 200 to 4300 nt mRNAs including chemical modifications, with 
sequence coverage at 100%, to detect/identify defects in the sequences, and to 
define the efficiencies of the 5'-capping and integrity of the polyadenylated 
tail. Our findings indicated that this platform should be valuable for 
quantitatively characterizing mRNA vaccines and other mRNA medicines."
423,"Heavy metals (HM) are among the elements that are rare in nature and threaten 
human health, animals, and the environment. Fix sources including (power plants, 
industries, homes) and mobile sources include (cars and motorcycles) are the 
main sources production and emission of HM. It is important to understand the 
main information about sources of emission, chemical processes (reactions, 
oxidation, and leaching), and how they precipitate. The aim of this study was to 
evaluation an increased risk of leukemia due to exposure to HM. In this article 
narrative, the first literature search was performed with 580 articles according 
to different databases: Elsevier, PubMed, Web of science, Spring, and Google 
Scholar databases. 70 articles were included in the analysis process. Finally, 8 
full-text articles were selected in this research. The search was restricted to 
English-language papers published between 2000 and 2021. In final stage 
literature, there is a notable health effect (carcinogenic) because of exposure 
to heavy metals. According to the results of this research natural procedures 
and human activities (industrial processes, car exhaust, and cigarette smoke) 
are the most important of ways that heavy metals can enter the natural cycle. 
Air, food, soil, water, and groundwater are the main sources of heavy metals 
that can cause severe disorders in the human body. After entering the body 
through ingestion heavy metals produce stable bio-toxic compounds. These 
compounds by disrupting biological processes, interrupt the body's functions and 
cause various cancers in the human body. The results of this study can help to 
politicians for make comprehensive decisions to solve the problem and increase 
public awareness of the use of protective equipment."
424,"Dose-limiting cardiotoxicity remains a major limitation in the clinical use of 
cancer chemotherapeutics. Here, we describe a role for Regulator of G protein 
Signaling 7 (RGS7) in chemotherapy-dependent heart damage, the demonstration for 
a functional role of RGS7 outside of the nervous system and retina. Though 
expressed at low levels basally, we observed robust up-regulation of RGS7 in the 
human and murine myocardium following chemotherapy exposure. In ventricular 
cardiomyocytes (VCM), RGS7 forms a complex with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent 
protein kinase (CaMKII) supported by key residues (K412 and P391) in the RGS 
domain of RGS7. In VCM treated with chemotherapeutic drugs, RGS7 facilitates 
CaMKII oxidation and phosphorylation and CaMKII-dependent oxidative stress, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. Cardiac-specific RGS7 knockdown 
protected the heart against chemotherapy-dependent oxidative stress, fibrosis, 
and myocyte loss and improved left ventricular function in mice treated with 
doxorubicin. Conversely, RGS7 overexpression induced fibrosis, reactive oxygen 
species generation, and cell death in the murine myocardium that were mitigated 
following CaMKII inhibition. RGS7 also drives production and release of the 
cardiokine neuregulin-1, which facilitates paracrine communication between VCM 
and neighboring vascular endothelial cells (EC), a maladaptive mechanism 
contributing to VCM dysfunction in the failing heart. Importantly, while RGS7 
was both necessary and sufficient to facilitate chemotherapy-dependent 
cytotoxicity in VCM, RGS7 is dispensable for the cancer-killing actions of these 
same drugs. These selective myocyte-intrinsic and myocyte-extrinsic actions of 
RGS7 in heart identify RGS7 as an attractive therapeutic target in the 
mitigation of chemotherapy-driven cardiotoxicity."
425,"The Ufd1/Npl4/Cdc48 complex is a universal protein segregase that plays key 
roles in eukaryotic cellular processes. Its functions orchestrating the 
clearance or removal of polyubiquitylated targets are established; however, 
prior studies suggest that the complex also targets substrates modified by the 
ubiquitin-like protein SUMO. Here, we show that interactions between Ufd1 and 
SUMO enhance unfolding of substrates modified by SUMO-polyubiquitin hybrid 
chains by the budding yeast Ufd1/Npl4/Cdc48 complex compared to substrates 
modified by polyubiquitin chains, a difference that is accentuated when the 
complex has a choice between these substrates. Incubating Ufd1/Npl4/Cdc48 with a 
substrate modified by a SUMO-polyubiquitin hybrid chain produced a series of 
single-particle cryo-EM structures that reveal features of interactions between 
Ufd1/Npl4/Cdc48 and ubiquitin prior to and during unfolding of ubiquitin. These 
results are consistent with cellular functions for SUMO and ubiquitin 
modifications and support a physical model wherein Ufd1/Npl4/Cdc48, SUMO, and 
ubiquitin conjugation pathways converge to promote clearance of proteins 
modified with SUMO and polyubiquitin."
426,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) naturally copurifies and crystallizes in a 
resting state with a molecule of its exchangeable cofactor, NADP+/NADPH, bound 
in each monomer of the homodimer. We report electrochemical studies with IDH1 
that exploit this property to reveal the massive advantage of nanoconfinement to 
increase the efficiency of multistep enzyme-catalyzed cascade reactions. When 
coloaded with ferredoxin NADP+ reductase in a nanoporous conducting indium tin 
oxide film, IDH1 carries out the complete electrochemical oxidation of 6 mM 
isocitrate (in 4mL) to 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), using only the NADP(H) that 
copurified with IDH1 and was carried into the electrode pores as cargo-the 
system remains active for days. The entrapped cofactor, now quantifiable by 
cyclic voltammetry, undergoes ~160,000 turnovers during the process. The results 
from a variety of electrocatalysis experiments imply that the local 
concentrations of the two nanoconfined enzymes lie around the millimolar range. 
The combination of crowding and entrapment results in a 102 to 103-fold increase 
in the efficiency of NADP(H) redox cycling. The ability of the method to drive 
cascade catalysis in either direction (oxidation or reduction) and remove and 
replace substrates was exploited to study redox-state dependent differences in 
cofactor binding between wild-type IDH1 and the cancer-linked R132H variant that 
catalyzes the ""gain of function"" reduction of 2OG to 2-hydroxyglutarate instead 
of isocitrate oxidation. The combined results demonstrate the power of 
nanoconfinement for facilitating multistep enzyme catalysis (in this case 
energized and verified electrochemically) and reveal insights into the dynamic 
role of nicotinamide cofactors as redox (hydride) carriers."
427,"The limited efficacy of the current antitumor microenvironment strategies is due 
in part to the poor understanding of the roles and relative contributions of the 
various tumor stromal cells to tumor development. Here, we describe a versatile 
in vivo anthrax toxin protein delivery system allowing for the unambiguous 
genetic evaluation of individual tumor stromal elements in cancer. Our 
reengineered tumor-selective anthrax toxin exhibits potent antiproliferative 
activity by disrupting ERK signaling in sensitive cells. Since this activity 
requires the surface expression of the capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG2) 
toxin receptor, genetic manipulation of CMG2 expression using our 
cell-type-specific CMG2 transgenic mice allows us to specifically define the 
role of individual tumor stromal cell types in tumor development. Here, we 
established mice with CMG2 only expressed in tumor endothelial cells (ECs) and 
determined the specific contribution of tumor stromal ECs to the toxin's 
antitumor activity. Our results demonstrate that disruption of ERK signaling 
only within tumor ECs is sufficient to halt tumor growth. We discovered that 
c-Myc is a downstream effector of ERK signaling and that the MEK-ERK-c-Myc 
central metabolic axis in tumor ECs is essential for tumor progression. As such, 
disruption of ERK-c-Myc signaling in host-derived tumor ECs by our 
tumor-selective anthrax toxins explains their high efficacy in solid tumor 
therapy."
428,"Cell membrane-coated nanoparticles are emerging as a new type of promising 
nanomaterials for immune evasion and targeted delivery. An underlying premise is 
that the unique biological functions of natural cell membranes can be conferred 
on the inherent physiochemical properties of nanoparticles by coating them with 
a cell membrane. However, the extent to which the membrane protein properties 
are preserved on these nanoparticles and the consequent bio-nano interactions 
are largely unexplored. Here, we synthesized two mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) 
membrane-coated silica nanoparticles (MCSNs), which have similar sizes but 
distinctly different stiffness values (MPa and GPa). Unexpectedly, a much lower 
macrophage uptake, but much higher cancer cell uptake, was found with the soft 
MCSNs compared with the stiff MCSNs. Intriguingly, we discovered that the soft 
MCSNs enabled the forming of a more protein-rich membrane coating and that 
coating had a high content of the MSC chemokine CXCR4 and MSC surface marker 
CD90. This led to the soft MCSNs enhancing cancer cell uptake mediated by the 
CD90/integrin receptor-mediated pathway and CXCR4/SDF-1 pathways. These findings 
provide a major step forward in our fundamental understanding of how the 
combination of nanoparticle elasticity and membrane coating may be used to 
facilitate bio-nano interactions and pave the way forward in the development of 
more effective cancer nanomedicines."
429,"Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV), made from glutaraldehyde-fixed xenografts, are 
widely used for surgical and transcatheter valve interventions but suffer from 
limited durability due to structural valve degeneration (SVD). We focused on 
metabolic syndrome (MetS), a risk factor for SVD and a highly prevalent 
phenotype in patients affected by valvular heart disease with a well-recognized 
cluster of comorbidities. Multicenter patient data (N = 251) revealed that 
patients with MetS were at significantly higher risk of accelerated SVD and 
required BHV replacement sooner. Using a next-generation proteomics approach, we 
identified significantly differential proteomes from leaflets of explanted BHV 
from MetS and non-MetS patients (N = 24). Given the significance of protein 
infiltration in MetS-induced SVD, we then demonstrated the protective effects of 
polyoxazoline modification of BHV leaflets to mitigate MetS-induced BHV 
biomaterial degeneration (calcification, tissue cross-linking, and 
microstructural changes) in an ex vivo serum model and an in vivo with MetS rat 
subcutaneous implants."
430,"Nanoparticles (NPs) are confronted with limited and disappointing delivery 
efficiency in tumors clinically. The tumor extracellular matrix (ECM), whose 
physical traits have recently been recognized as new hallmarks of cancer, forms 
a main steric obstacle for NP diffusion, yet the role of tumor ECM physical 
traits in NP diffusion remains largely unexplored. Here, we characterized the 
physical properties of clinical gastric tumor samples and observed limited 
distribution of NPs in decellularized tumor tissues. We also performed molecular 
dynamics simulations and in vitro hydrogel experiments through single-particle 
tracking to investigate the diffusion mechanism of NPs and understand the 
influence of tumor ECM physical properties on NP diffusion both individually and 
collectively. Furthermore, we developed an estimation matrix model with 
evaluation scores of NP diffusion efficiency through comprehensive analyses of 
the data. Thus, beyond finding that loose and soft ECM with aligned structure 
contribute to efficient diffusion, we now have a systemic model to predict NP 
diffusion efficiency based on ECM physical traits and provide critical guidance 
for personalized tumor diagnosis and treatment."
431,"Although antibodies targeting specific tumor-expressed antigens are the standard 
of care for some cancers, the identification of cancer-specific targets amenable 
to antibody binding has remained a bottleneck in development of new 
therapeutics. To overcome this challenge, we developed a high-throughput 
platform that allows for the unbiased, simultaneous discovery of antibodies and 
targets based on phenotypic binding profiles. Applying this platform to ovarian 
cancer, we identified a wide diversity of cancer targets including receptor 
tyrosine kinases, adhesion and migration proteins, proteases and proteins 
regulating angiogenesis in a single round of screening using genomics, flow 
cytometry, and mass spectrometry. In particular, we identified BCAM as a 
promising candidate for targeted therapy in high-grade serous ovarian cancers. 
More generally, this approach provides a rapid and flexible framework to 
identify cancer targets and antibodies."
432,"WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) is a core scaffolding component of many multiprotein 
complexes that perform a variety of critical chromatin-centric processes in the 
nucleus. WDR5 is a component of the mixed lineage leukemia MLL/SET complex and 
localizes MYC to chromatin at tumor-critical target genes. As a part of these 
complexes, WDR5 plays a role in sustaining oncogenesis in a variety of human 
cancers that are often associated with poor prognoses. Thus, WDR5 has been 
recognized as an attractive therapeutic target for treating both solid and 
hematological tumors. Previously, small-molecule inhibitors of the 
WDR5-interaction (WIN) site and WDR5 degraders have demonstrated robust in vitro 
cellular efficacy in cancer cell lines and established the therapeutic potential 
of WDR5. However, these agents have not demonstrated significant in vivo 
efficacy at pharmacologically relevant doses by oral administration in animal 
disease models. We have discovered WDR5 WIN-site inhibitors that feature 
bicyclic heteroaryl P7 units through structure-based design and address the 
limitations of our previous series of small-molecule inhibitors. Importantly, 
our lead compounds exhibit enhanced on-target potency, excellent oral 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, and potent dose-dependent in vivo efficacy in a 
mouse MV4:11 subcutaneous xenograft model by oral dosing. Furthermore, these 
in vivo probes show excellent tolerability under a repeated high-dose regimen in 
rodents to demonstrate the safety of the WDR5 WIN-site inhibition mechanism. 
Collectively, our results provide strong support for WDR5 WIN-site inhibitors to 
be utilized as potential anticancer therapeutics."
433,"Impaired endothelial cell (EC)-mediated angiogenesis contributes to critical 
limb ischemia in diabetic patients. The sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway 
participates in angiogenesis but is repressed in hyperglycemia by obscure 
mechanisms. We investigated the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR39 on SHH 
pathway activation in ECs and ischemia-induced angiogenesis in animals with 
chronic hyperglycemia. Human aortic ECs from healthy and type 2 diabetic (T2D) 
donors were cultured in vitro. GPR39 mRNA expression was significantly elevated 
in T2D. The EC proliferation, migration, and tube formation were attenuated by 
adenovirus-mediated GPR39 overexpression (Ad-GPR39) or GPR39 agonist TC-G-1008 
in vitro. The production of proangiogenic factors was reduced by Ad-GPR39. 
Conversely, human ECs transfected with GPR39 siRNA or the mouse aortic ECs 
isolated from GPR39 global knockout (GPR39KO) mice displayed enhanced migration 
and proliferation compared with their respective controls. GPR39 suppressed the 
basal and ligand-dependent activation of the SHH effector GLI1, leading to 
attenuated EC migration. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that the GPR39 direct 
binding of the suppressor of fused (SUFU), the SHH pathway endogenous inhibitor, 
may achieve this. Furthermore, in ECs with GPR39 knockdown, the robust GLI1 
activation and EC migration were abolished by SUFU overexpression. In a chronic 
diabetic model of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and low-dose streptozotocin 
(STZ)-induced hyperglycemia, the GPR39KO mice demonstrated a faster pace of 
revascularization from hind limb ischemia and lower incidence of tissue necrosis 
than GPR39 wild-type (GPR39WT) counterparts. These findings have provided a 
conceptual framework for developing therapeutic tools that ablate or inhibit 
GPR39 for ischemic tissue repair under metabolic stress."
434,"Breast cancer (BC) is a complex disease comprising multiple distinct subtypes 
with different genetic features and pathological characteristics. Although a 
large number of antineoplastic compounds have been approved for clinical use, 
patient-to-patient variability in drug response is frequently observed, 
highlighting the need for efficient treatment prediction for individualized 
therapy. Several patient-derived models have been established lately for the 
prediction of drug response. However, each of these models has its limitations 
that impede their clinical application. Here, we report that the whole-tumor 
cell culture (WTC) ex vivo model could be stably established from all breast 
tumors with a high success rate (98 out of 116), and it could reassemble the 
parental tumors with the endogenous microenvironment. We observed strong 
clinical associations and predictive values from the investigation of a broad 
range of BC therapies with WTCs derived from a patient cohort. The accuracy was 
further supported by the correlation between WTC-based test results and 
patients' clinical responses in a separate validation study, where the 
neoadjuvant treatment regimens of 15 BC patients were mimicked. Collectively, 
the WTC model allows us to accomplish personalized drug testing within 10 d, 
even for small-sized tumors, highlighting its potential for individualized BC 
therapy. Furthermore, coupled with genomic and transcriptomic analyses, 
WTC-based testing can also help to stratify specific patient groups for 
assignment into appropriate clinical trials, as well as validate potential 
biomarkers during drug development."
435,"Obesity is a major risk factor for cancer. Conventional thought suggests that 
elevated adiposity predisposes to heightened inflammatory stress and potentiates 
tumor growth, yet underlying mechanisms remain ill-defined. Here, we show that 
tumors from patients with a body mass index >35 carry a high burden of senescent 
cells. In mouse syngeneic tumor models, we correlated a pronounced accretion of 
senescent cancer cells with poorly immunogenic tumors when mice were subjected 
to diet-induced obesity (DIO). Highly immunogenic tumors showed lesser 
senescence burden suggesting immune-mediated elimination of senescent cancer 
cells, likely targeted as a consequence of their senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype. Treatment with the senolytic BH3 mimetic small molecule inhibitor 
ABT-263 selectively stalled tumor growth in mice with DIO to rates comparable to 
regular diet-fed mice. Thus, consideration of body adiposity in the selection of 
cancer therapy may be a critical determinant for disease outcome in poorly 
immunogenic malignancies."
436,"B cells are an essential component of humoral immunity. Their primary function 
is to mount antigen-specific antibody responses to eliminate pathogens. Despite 
an increase in B-cell number, we found that serum-IgG levels were low in breast 
cancer patients. To solve this conundrum, we used high-dimensional 
flow-cytometry to analyse the heterogeneity of B-cell populations and identified 
a tumor-specific CD19+CD24hiCD38hi IL10-producing B regulatory (Breg) cell 
subset. Although IL10 is a Breg-cell marker, being an intracellular protein, it 
is of limited value for Breg-cell isolation. Highly-expressed Breg cell-surface 
proteins CD24 and CD38 also impede the isolation of viable Breg cells. These are 
hurdles that limit understanding of Breg-cell functions. Our transcriptomic 
analysis identified, CD39-negativity as an exclusive, sorting-friendly surface 
marker for tumor-associated Breg cells. We found that the identified 
CD19+CD39-IL10+ B-cell population was suppressive in nature as it limited T 
helper-cell proliferation, type-1 cytokine production, and T effector-cell 
survival, and augmented CD4+FOXP3+ Treg-cell generation. These tumor-associated 
Breg cells were also found to restrict autologous T follicular helper (Tfh)-cell 
expansion and IL21 secretion, thereby inhibiting germinal transcript formation 
and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) expression involved in H-chain 
class-switch recombination. This isotype-switching abnormality was shown to 
hinder B-cell differentiation into class-switched memory B cells and subsequent 
high-affinity antibody-producing plasma B cells, which collectively led to the 
dampening of IgG-mediated antibody responses in cancer patients. As low IgG is 
associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients, Breg-cell depletion could be 
a promising future therapy for boosting plasma B cell-mediated antibody 
responses."
437,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule produced by NO synthases (NOS1-3) to 
control processes such as neurotransmission, vascular permeability, and immune 
function. Although myeloid cell-derived NO has been shown to suppress T-cell 
responses, the role of NO synthesis in T cells themselves is not well 
understood. Here, we showed that significant amounts of NO were synthesized in 
human and murine CD8+ T cells following activation. Tumor growth was 
significantly accelerated in a T cell-specific, Nos2-null mouse model. Genetic 
deletion of Nos2 expression in murine T cells altered effector differentiation, 
reduced tumor infiltration, and inhibited recall responses and adoptive cell 
transfer function. These data show that endogenous NO production plays a 
critical role in T cell-mediated tumor immunity."
438,"INTRODUCTION: Plasma amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, phosphorylated-tau181 
(p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light 
(NfL) are putative blood biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
head-to-head cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons of the aforementioned 
biomarkers across the AD continuum are lacking.
METHODS: Plasma Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL were measured utilizing 
the Single Molecule Array (Simoa) platform and compared cross-sectionally across 
the AD continuum, wherein Aβ-PET (positron emission tomography)-negative 
cognitively unimpaired (CU Aβ-, n = 81) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI Aβ-, 
n = 26) participants were compared with Aβ-PET-positive participants across the 
AD continuum (CU Aβ+, n = 39; MCI Aβ+, n = 33; AD Aβ+, n = 46) from the 
Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) 
cohort. Longitudinal plasma biomarker changes were also assessed in MCI (n = 27) 
and AD (n = 29) participants compared with CU (n = 120) participants. In 
addition, associations between baseline plasma biomarker levels and prospective 
cognitive decline and Aβ-PET load were assessed over a 7 to 10-year duration.
RESULTS: Lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio and elevated p-tau181 and GFAP were 
observed in CU Aβ+, MCI Aβ+, and AD Aβ+, whereas elevated plasma NfL was 
observed in MCI Aβ+ and AD Aβ+, compared with CU Aβ- and MCI Aβ-. Among the 
aforementioned plasma biomarkers, for models with and without AD risk factors 
(age, sex, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status), p-tau181 performed 
equivalent to or better than other biomarkers in predicting a brain Aβ-/+ status 
across the AD continuum. However, for models with and without the AD risk 
factors, a biomarker panel of Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, p-tau181, and GFAP performed 
equivalent to or better than any of the biomarkers alone in predicting brain 
Aβ-/+ status across the AD continuum. Longitudinally, plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, 
p-tau181, and GFAP were altered in MCI compared with CU, and plasma GFAP and NfL 
were altered in AD compared with CU. In addition, lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and 
higher p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL were associated with prospective cognitive 
decline and lower plasma Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40, and higher p-tau181 and GFAP were 
associated with increased Aβ-PET load prospectively.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that plasma biomarkers are altered 
cross-sectionally and longitudinally, along the AD continuum, and are 
prospectively associated with cognitive decline and brain Aβ-PET load. In 
addition, although p-tau181 performed equivalent to or better than other 
biomarkers in predicting an Aβ-/+ status across the AD continuum, a panel of 
biomarkers may have superior Aβ-/+ status predictive capability across the AD 
continuum.
HIGHLIGHTS:  Area under the curve (AUC) of p-tau181 ≥ AUC of Aβ42/40, GFAP, NfL 
in predicting PET Aβ-/+ status (Aβ-/+).  AUC of Aβ42/40+p-tau181+GFAP panel ≥ 
AUC of Aβ42/40/p-tau181/GFAP/NfL for Aβ-/+.  Longitudinally, Aβ42/40, p-tau181, 
and GFAP were altered in MCI versus CU.  Longitudinally, GFAP and NfL were 
altered in AD versus CU.  Aβ42/40, p-tau181, GFAP, and NfL are associated with 
prospective cognitive decline.  Aβ42/40, p-tau181, and GFAP are associated with 
increased PET Aβ load prospectively."
439,"OBJECTIVE: To identify reporting guidelines related to surgical technique and 
propose recommendations for areas that require improvement.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A protocol-guided scoping review was conducted. A 
literature search of MEDLINE, the EQUATOR Network Library, Google Scholar, and 
Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations was conducted to identify 
surgical technique reporting guidelines published up to December 31, 2021.
RESULTS: We finally included 55 surgical technique reporting guidelines, 
vascular surgery (n=18, 32.7%) was most common among the clinical specialties 
covered. The included guidelines generally showed a low degree of international 
and multidisciplinary cooperation. Few guidelines provided a detailed 
development process (n=14, 25.5%), conducted a systematic literature review 
(n=13, 23.6%), used the Delphi method (n=4, 7.3%), or described post-publication 
strategy (n=6, 10.9%). The vast majority guidelines focused on the reporting of 
intraoperative period (n=50, 90.9%). However, of the guidelines requiring 
detailed descriptions of surgical technique methodology (n=43, 78.2%), most 
failed to provide guidance on what constitutes an adequate description.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates significant deficiencies in the development 
methodology and practicality of reporting guidelines for surgical technique. A 
standardized reporting guideline that is developed rigorously and focuses on 
details of surgical technique may serve as a necessary impetus for change."
440,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Lack of thorough knowledge for complicated 
immune-microenvironment (IM) within a variety of liver metastases (LMs) leads to 
inappropriate treatment and unsatisfactory prognosis. We aimed to characterize 
IM subtypes and investigate potential mechanisms in LMs.
METHODS: Mass cytometry was applied to characterize immune landscape of primary 
liver cancers and liver metastases cohort. Transcriptomic and whole exome 
sequencing were used to explore potential mechanisms across distinct IM 
subtypes. Single cell transcriptomic sequencing, multiplex fluorescent 
immunohistochemistry, cell culture, mouse model, western blot, quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used for validation.
RESULTS: Five IM subtypes were revealed in 100 LMs and 50 primary liver cancers. 
Patients featured terminally exhausted (IM1) or rare-T-cell-inflamed (IM2 and 
IM3) immune characteristics showed worse outcome. Increased intra-tumor 
heterogeneity, enriched somatic TP53, KRAS, APC, PIK3CA mutations and 
hyper-activated hypoxia signaling accounted for the formation of vicious 
subtypes. SLC2A1 promoted immune suppression and desert via increasing 
proportion of Spp1+ macrophages and their inhibitory interactions with T cells 
in liver metastatic lesions. Furthermore, SLC2A1 promoted immune escape and 
liver metastasis through inducing regulatory T cells including Tregs and 
LAG3+CD4+ T cells in primary colorectal cancer.
CONCLUSION: The study provided integrated multi-omics landscape of liver 
metastasis, uncovering potential mechanisms for vicious IM subtypes and 
confirming the roles of SLC2A1 in regulating tumor microenvironment remodeling 
in both primary tumor and liver metastatic lesions."
441,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common form of pediatric cancer 
affecting the lymphoblast, a type of white blood cell found in the bone marrow. 
In this disease, the normal lymphoblast cells transform into leukemic cells and 
subsequently enter the bloodstream. Leukemic cells found in patients with ALL 
have shown differences in cholesterol uptake and utilization. Current treatment 
consists of chemotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy, and 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In addition, minimal residual 
disease (MRD) has become an effective tool in measuring treatment efficacy and 
the potential for relapse. Chemotherapy resistance remains a significant barrier 
in the treatment of ALL. Biomarkers such as an upregulated Akt signaling pathway 
and an overexpressed VLA-4 integrin-protein have been associated with drug 
resistance. Nanoparticles have been used to favorably alter the pharmacokinetic 
profile of conventional drug agents. These drug-delivery systems are designed to 
selectively deliver their drug payloads to desired targets. Therefore, 
nanoparticles offer advantages such as improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. 
This review highlights conventional treatment options, distinctive 
characteristics of pediatric ALL, therapeutic challenges encountered during 
therapy, and the key role that nanotherapeutics play in the treatment of ALL."
442,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the percentage and correlates of giving and receiving 
cigarettes as gifts among adult non-smokers in China.
METHODS: We analyzed non-smokers (N=1,813) aged ≥18 years using data from the 
International Tobacco Control China Wave 5 Survey. Descriptive statistics 
summarized the characteristics of those who gave and received cigarettes as 
gifts. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors 
associated with the two behaviors.
RESULTS: Among non-smokers, 9.9% reported giving cigarettes as gifts to family 
or friends in the last 6 months. Higher level of knowledge about smoking harms 
was associated with lower adjusted odds of gifting cigarettes. Non-smokers aged 
25-39, with middle income, positive attitude toward cigarette gifts, exposure to 
anti-smoking information and smoking promotion, and those who reported receiving 
cigarettes as gifts from family or friends were more likely to give cigarettes 
as gifts. 6.6% of non-smokers reported receiving cigarettes as gifts in the last 
6 months. High education, neutral or positive attitude toward cigarette gifts, 
exposure to anti-smoking information, exposure to smoking promotion, and having 
smoking friends were associated with receiving cigarettes as gifts.
CONCLUSIONS: It is concerning that Chinese cultural norms that support cigarette 
gifting have extended to giving non-smokers cigarettes as gifts. Effective 
anti-smoking messages are needed. Changing the norms around cigarette gifting 
and increasing knowledge about smoking harms should help reduce cigarette 
gifting among non-smokers.
IMPLICATIONS: Easy access to cigarettes received as gifts, along with the wide 
acceptance of smoking in China, places Chinese non-smokers in a risky position. 
More educational campaigns targeting non-smokers to proactively prevent them 
from smoking are called for.The ineffectiveness of existing anti-smoking 
information highlights the need for more effective anti-smoking messages.That 
attitude toward cigarette gifts is the strongest predictor of giving cigarettes 
as gifts suggests a need for interventions to reverse the positive attitude 
about cigarette gifting in order to decrease the popularity of this activity."
443,"Cancer is one of the most serious malignant diseases, and chemotherapy is 
cancer's main clinical treatment method. However, chemotherapy inevitably 
produces drug resistance, and side effects accompany them. Adjuvant therapy is 
an effective way to enhance chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity and reduce side 
effects. This study found allicin, garlic's active ingredient, is an inhibitor 
of transmembrane protein 16A (TMEM16A), a novel drug target of lung 
adenocarcinoma. Allicin concentration-dependently inhibited TMEM16A currents 
with an IC50 of 24.35 ± 4.14 μM. Allicin thiosulfinate moieties bound with 
R535A/E624A/E633A residues of TMEM16A blocked the ion transport function and 
downregulated TMEM16A protein expression affecting the mitogen-activated protein 
kinase signal transduction. Then, allicin reduced the viability and migration of 
LA795 cells, and induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, multitarget combination 
administration results indicated that the therapeutic effect of 3.56 mg/kg 
allicin and 3 mg/kg cisplatin combined administration was superior to the 
superposition of the two drugs alone, demonstrating that the anticancer effects 
of allicin and cisplatin were synergistic. In addition, low-concentration 
combined administration also avoided the side effects of cisplatin in mice. 
Based on the good tumor suppressor effect and high biosafety of allicin and 
cisplatin combination in vivo, allicin can be used for food adjuvant therapy of 
cisplatin chemotherapy."
444,"A cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) is a photolesion which is produced by a 
cycloaddition reaction between two stacked pyrimidine bases upon UV light 
absorption. Because of its harmful effect on important cellular processes 
involving DNA and especially its relevance to skin cancer, the mechanisms of how 
a CPD is formed or repaired have been studied extensively, and it has been 
demonstrated that flanking nucleotide sequences play a crucial role in CPD 
formation or self-repair. Understanding the mechanisms behind this sequence 
dependence of CPD formation or self-repair is of great importance because it can 
give us valuable information on which sequence will be vulnerable to this DNA 
photodamage. This Perspective focuses on the mechanisms of how flanking 
nucleotide sequences affect CPD formation or self-repair, especially 
highlighting the role of computational studies in this field."
445,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are environmentally persistent 
endocrine-disrupting chemicals associated with long-term health outcomes. PFAS 
are transferred from maternal blood to human milk, an important exposure source 
for infants, and understanding of this transfer is evolving. We characterized 
concentrations of 10 PFAS in human milk (n = 426) and compared milk-to-plasma 
concentrations of 9 PFAS among a subset of women with paired samples (n = 294) 
from the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study using liquid chromatography-isotope 
dilution tandem mass spectrometry. We examined the relationship between 
perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in plasma versus 
milk and fit linear regression models to assess relationships between milk PFOA 
and PFOS and participant characteristics. The median plasma PFOA concentration 
was 0.94 ng/mL (interquartile range, IQR, 0.59-1.34) and that of PFOS was 2.60 
ng/mL (IQR 1.80-3.90); the median milk PFOA concentration was 0.017 ng/mL (IQR 
0.012-0.027) and that of PFOS was 0.024 ng/mL (IQR 0.016-0.036). PFOA and PFOS 
plasma and milk concentrations showed correlations of ρ = 0.83 and 0.77, 
respectively (p < 0.001). Parity, previous lactation, week of milk collection, 
and body mass index were inversely associated with milk PFAS. We estimate that 
even among our general population cohort, some infants (∼6.5%) are exposed to 
amounts of PFAS via milk that may have long-term health impacts."
446,"The oncogene ERBB2 encoding the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER2) 
is frequently overexpressed or amplified and occasionally mutated in a variety 
of human cancers. The early discovery of this oncogene, its established 
oncogenic relevance in diverse cancers, its substantial expression on surface of 
cancer cells, and its druggable catalytic activity have made it one of the most 
pursued targets in the history of cancer drug development. Initiatives targeting 
HER2 provided the early stimulus for several transformational pharmaceutical 
technologies including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 
antibody-drug conjugates, and others. The seismic impact of these efforts has 
been felt in treatment of many cancers including breast, gastroesophageal, lung, 
colorectal and others. This impact continues to broaden with increasing 
indications on the horizon and a plethora of novel agents in development. 
However, implementation of these therapeutic strategies has been complex. The 
clinical translation of every one of these classes of agents has been notable 
for underperformance or overperformance characteristics that have informed new 
lines of research providing deeper insights into the mechanistic complexities 
and unrealized opportunities provided by this molecular target. Despite all the 
successes to date, the preponderance of scientific evidence indicates that the 
full potential of HER2 as a target for cancer therapeutics is far greater than 
currently realized and numerous lines of investigation are ongoing to deepen and 
broaden the scope of impact of HER2 as a signaling, homing, or immunologic 
target. In this review, we explore the existing data and evolving paradigms 
surrounding this remarkable target for cancer therapy."
447,"Taxus wallichiana Zucc. is a high valued medicinal plant and has been mainly 
studied for its anti-cancer properties. However, research on its other important 
biological activities, such as its antimicrobial potential, still needs 
attention. The focus of the present study is to investigate the antimicrobial 
activity of secondary metabolites of T. wallichiana needles against 3 different 
groups of microorganisms, i. e., bacteria, actinobacteria, and fungi. Bioactive 
compounds from T. wallichiana needles were separated through column 
chromatography, and, TLC-bioautography. Mobile phases were optimized using 
Snyder's selectivity triangle. Antimicrobial spots were fractionated and 
compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) and 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Functional groups were 
characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to identify the molecular structures. GC/MS 
and LC/MS data analysis confirm the presence of fatty acids (arachidic acid, 
behenic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid), vitamins (nicotinamide), and 
alkaloids (cinchonine, timolol), aminobenzamides (procainamide), carbocyclic 
sugar (myoinositol), and alkane hydrocarbon (hexadecane), having antimicrobial 
activity in the needles of T. wallichiana. To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first report on the isolation and characterization of antimicrobial 
compounds from the needles of Taxus wallichiana (Himalayan yew). The data 
obtained from the present study will be supportive to the new drug discoveries 
in modern medicine with various combinations of medicinal plant's active 
constituents that can be used for curing many diseases."
448,"Cell cycle progression plays a vital role in regulating proliferation, 
metabolism, and apoptosis. Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures have emerged as 
an important class of in vitro disease models, and incorporating the variation 
occurring from cell cycle progression in these systems is critical. Here, we 
report the use of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic imaging to 
identify subtle biochemical changes within cells, indicative of the G1/S and 
G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Following previous studies, we first synchronized 
samples from two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, confirmed their states by flow 
cytometry and DNA quantification, and recorded spectra. We determined two 
critical wavenumbers (1059 and 1219 cm-1) as spectral indicators of the cell 
cycle for a set of isogenic breast cancer cell lines (MCF10AT series). These two 
simple spectral markers were then applied to distinguish cell cycle stages in a 
3D cell culture model using four cell lines that represent the main stages of 
cancer progression from normal cells to metastatic disease. Temporal dependence 
of spectral biomarkers during acini maturation validated the hypothesis that the 
cells are more proliferative in the early stages of acini development; later 
stages of the culture showed stability in the overall composition but unique 
spatial differences in cells in the two phases. Altogether, this study presents 
a computational and quantitative approach for cell phase analysis in tissue-like 
3D structures without any biomarker staining and provides a means to 
characterize the impact of the cell cycle on 3D biological systems and disease 
diagnostic studies using IR imaging."
449,"Craniopharyngiomas are clinically aggressive tumours due to their invasive 
behaviour and recalcitrant tendency to recur after therapy. There are two types 
based on their distinct histology and molecular features: The papillary 
craniopharyngioma (PCP), which is associated with BRAF-V600E mutations and the 
adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP), characterised by mutations in CTNNB1 
(encoding β-catenin). Patients with craniopharyngioma show symptoms linked to 
the location of the tumour close to the optic pathways, hypothalamus and 
pituitary gland, such as increased intracranial pressure, endocrine deficiencies 
and visual defects. Treatment is not specific and mostly non-curative, and 
frequently includes surgery, which may achieve gross-total or partial resection, 
followed by radiotherapy. In cystic tumours, frequent drainage is often required 
and intracystic instillation of drugs has been used to help manage cyst 
refilling. More recently targeted therapies have been used, particularly in 
papillary craniopharyngioma, but also now in adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma 
and clinical trials are underway or in development. Although patient survival is 
high, the consequences of the tumour and its treatment can lead to severe 
comorbidities resulting in poor quality of life, in particular for those 
patients that bear tumours with hypothalamic involvement. Accordingly, in these 
patients at risk for the development of a hypothalamic syndrome 
hypothalamus-sparing treatment strategies such as limited resection followed by 
irradiation are recommended. In this review, we provide an update on various 
aspects of craniopharyngioma, with emphasis on recent advances in the 
understanding of tumour pathogenesis, clinical consequences, management and 
therapies."
450,"Cytosolic DNA promotes inflammatory responses upon detection by the cyclic 
GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS). It has been suggested that cGAS downregulation 
is an immune escape strategy harnessed by tumor cells. Here, we used 
glioblastoma cells that show undetectable cGAS levels to address if alternative 
DNA detection pathways can promote pro-inflammatory signaling. We show that the 
DNA-PK DNA repair complex (i) drives cGAS-independent IRF3-mediated type I 
Interferon responses and (ii) that its catalytic activity is required for 
cGAS-dependent cGAMP production and optimal downstream signaling. We further 
show that the cooperation between DNA-PK and cGAS favors the expression of 
chemokines that promote macrophage recruitment in the tumor microenvironment in 
a glioblastoma model, a process that impairs early tumorigenesis but correlates 
with poor outcome in glioblastoma patients. Thus, our study supports that 
cGAS-dependent signaling is acquired during tumorigenesis and that cGAS and 
DNA-PK activities should be analyzed concertedly to predict the impact of 
strategies aiming to boost tumor immunogenicity."
451,"The role of cytosolic stress granules in the integrated stress response has 
remained largely enigmatic. Here, we studied the functionality of the 
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in cells that were unable to form stress 
granules. Surprisingly, the inability of cells to form cytosolic stress granules 
had primarily a negative impact on the functionality of the nuclear UPS. While 
defective ribosome products (DRiPs) accumulated at stress granules in thermally 
stressed control cells, they localized to nucleoli in stress granule-deficient 
cells. The nuclear localization of DRiPs was accompanied by redistribution and 
enhanced degradation of SUMOylated proteins. Depletion of the SUMO-targeted 
ubiquitin ligase RNF4, which targets SUMOylated misfolded proteins for 
proteasomal degradation, largely restored the functionality of the UPS in the 
nuclear compartment in stress granule-deficient cells. Stress granule-deficient 
cells showed an increase in the formation of mutant ataxin-1 nuclear inclusions 
when exposed to thermal stress. Our data reveal that stress granules play an 
important role in the sequestration of cytosolic misfolded proteins, thereby 
preventing these proteins from accumulating in the nucleus, where they would 
otherwise infringe nuclear proteostasis."
452,"The detection of circulating tumor microRNAs (miRNAs) holds great promise for 
the noninvasive and early-stage diagnosis of cancer. However, the low abundance 
of lung cancer-related miRNAs and the false-positive results of single miRNA 
detection limited the development of strip-based point-of-care testing methods 
in clinic. We developed a duplex-specific nuclease (DSN)-mediated and dual-AND 
logic gate-based triple-line lateral flow strip detection system for the rapid 
and simultaneous detection of four miRNAs of lung cancer in a single strip test. 
This system combines DSN-mediated signal amplification with AND logic gate-based 
simple signal output. Meanwhile, the limit of detection of this platform was 
calculated to be 26.51 fM. Furthermore, this assay was used to detect lung 
cancer-related miRNAs from serum in a homogeneous and separation-free format, 
which could discriminate lung cancer patients from healthy individuals with an 
accuracy of 100%. Our approach provides a simple and easy-to-handle method for 
the diagnosis of lung cancer in clinic."
453,"The application of drug delivery systems based on ferritin nanocarrier has been 
developed as a potential strategy in cancer therapy. The limited permeability of 
ferritin remains a challenge for drug penetration into the deeper tumor tissues. 
CendR peptides have been reported to bear tumor-specific penetration by 
recognizing neuropilin (NRP-1) receptor that overexpressed on a wide range of 
cancer cells. Herein, we modified CendR peptide L(RGERPPR), its retro-inverso 
peptide D(RPPREGR), and inverso peptide D(RGERPPR) on the outer surface of human 
H chain ferritin by sulfhydryl-maleimide coupling reaction. Approximately 45 
paclitaxel (PTX) molecules could be loaded into each ferritin inner cavity by a 
thermal-triggered method at a specific ionic strength. The penetration ability 
of three peptide-modified ferritin constructs showed that D(RGERPPR)-modified 
HFtn was able to be engulfed by A549 and MCF-7 tumor cells and spheroids at the 
highest level. Due to the dual-targeting effect of ferritin and modified 
peptides, the PTX-loaded nanocomposites could effectively enter the cells with 
high expression of TfR1 and NRP-1 receptors and enhanced the cytotoxicity 
against tumor cells. Remarkably, H-D(RGE)-PTX displayed a superior tumor growth 
suppression efficacy in A549 tumor-bearing nude mice. The inverso CendR 
peptide-modified HFtn nanocarrier was first generated and could provide an 
effective dual-targeting platform for treatment of cancers."
454,"Volatile formaldehyde (FA) in exhaled breath (EB) is considered as a biomarker 
for lung cancer (LC). On-the-spot selective and sensitive detection of gaseous 
FA is rather important for LC screening and diagnosis. Herein, a 
tetrakis(4-pyridylphenyl)ethylene (Py-TPE)-based zinc metal-organic framework 
(MOF) with excellent aggregation-induced emission (AIE) property was utilized 
for absorption and selective detection of FA in EB. The porous Zn-Py-TPE served 
as a gaseous confinement cavity for the adsorption of FA in EB. Interestingly, 
Zn-Py-TPE was aggregated on paper, and then aggregation-induced 
chemiluminescence (CL) emission can be triggered by only adding 
bis(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)oxalate (TCPO). Though without H2O2, the CL of 
Zn-Py-TPE-TCPO was enhanced greatly by FA. FA promoted the aggregation of 
Zn-Py-TPE on paper by forming halogen bonding between FA and Zn-Py-TPE, which 
contributed to the better selectivity. FA can also stimulate the production of 
more singlet oxygen (1O2) in the Zn-Py-TPE-TCPO CL system. Hence, FA could be 
detected via the proposed Zn-Py-TPE-TCPO system with a quantification linear 
range of 1.0-100.0 ppb and detection limit of 0.3 ppb. This portable, low-cost, 
and sensitive paper-based platform can achieve trace FA detection in EB and is 
expected to provide an on-the-spot screening platform for lung cancer."
455,"The Neck Imaging Reporting and Data System (NI-RADS) is a guide developed and 
introduced in 2017 by head and neck radiologists who worked in an academic 
radiology department. Based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, the 
initial goals of NI-RADS were to make posttreatment head and neck cancer imaging 
dictations more succinct and efficient, guide treating physicians in the next 
appropriate steps when recurrence was suspected, and encourage institutional and 
national research. NI-RADS is more than a dictation template, and it is best 
instituted after a head and neck imaging practice is established. We support the 
use of NI-RADS once a radiologist understands the nuances of head and neck 
cancer, including the biology, common subsites involved, essentials of tumor 
staging, common posttreatment benign imaging appearances, and subtleties of 
recurrent disease."
456,"BACKGROUND: Omentoplasty is a commonly performed procedure after 
abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer, but its effectiveness to reduce 
pelviperineal complications is not firmly established.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of omentoplasty on short-term pelviperineal 
complications and postoperative outcomes following long-course 
(chemo)radiotherapy and abdominoperineal resection in patients with locally 
advanced and locally recurrent rectal cancer.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTINGS: Single center.
PATIENTS: All patients with locally advanced and locally recurrent rectal cancer 
undergoing abdominoperineal resection after neoadjuvant (chemo)radiation in a 
tertiary referral center between 2008 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Multivariable logistic and linear regression analyses 
were performed to examine the association between omentoplasty and pelviperineal 
complications (e.g., perineal wound problems and pelvic abscesses), duration of 
nasogastric tube drainage and length of hospital stay.
RESULTS: A total of 305 patients were analysed of which 245 underwent 
omentoplasty (80%). Pelviperineal complications occurred in 151 patients (50%) 
overall, and in 125 (51%) and 26 (43%) of patients with or without omentoplasty, 
respectively. Independent predictors of pelviperineal complications in 
multivariable analyses were smoking (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.46 - 4.94) and high BMI 
(OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.00 - 2.83), but not omentoplasty (OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.77-2.40). 
Mean duration of nasogastric tube drainage was longer after omentoplasty (6 vs. 
4 days) with a significant association in multivariable analysis (β-coefficient 
1.97, 95% CI 0.35-3.59). Patients undergoing omentoplasty had a significantly 
longer hospital stay (14 vs. 10 days), and omentoplasty remained associated with 
a prolonged hospital stay after adjusting for confounding (β-coefficient 3.05, 
95% CI 0.05-5.74).
LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design.
CONCLUSION: Omentoplasty was not associated with a reduced risk of the 
occurrence of short-term pelviperineal complications after abdominoperineal 
resection in patients undergoing long-course (chemo)radiotherapy. Furthermore, 
in patients undergoing omentoplasty a prolonged duration of nasogastric tube 
drainage and hospital stay was observed. See Video Abstract at

457,"BACKGROUND: Gold standard management of stage III colon cancer includes surgical 
resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Despite improved overall survival with 
adjuvant chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer, it is reportedly underused in 
older adults. To date, no contemporary national analysis of adjuvant 
chemotherapy use and its impact in older adults with stage III colon cancer 
exists.
OBJECTIVE: To assess current use of adjuvant chemotherapy in older adults with 
stage III colon cancer and determine factors associated with noncompliance.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTINGS: Conducted using the National Cancer Database.
PATIENTS: Patients 65 years and older undergoing curative resection for stage 
III colon adenocarcinomas from 2010-2017.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adjuvant chemotherapy use, factors associated with 
adjuvant chemotherapy use, and overall survival with and without adjuvant 
chemotherapy in older adults with pathologic stage III disease.
RESULTS: Of 64,608 patients included, 64.3% received adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly independently associated with improved 
1-, 3-and 5-year overall survival versus no adjuvant chemotherapy (92.8%, 75.3%, 
62.4% vs. 70.8%, 46.6%, 32.7%; respectively, HR 0.475, 95% CI 0.459-0.492, p < 
0.001). Compared with the no adjuvant chemotherapy cohort, patients who received 
adjuvant chemotherapy were younger, female, and less co-morbid (p < 0.001). 
Factors associated with adjuvant chemotherapy noncompliance included advancing 
age (OR 0.857, 95% CI 0.854-0.861), lower annual income (OR 0.891, 95% CI 
0.844-0.940), open approach (0.730, 95% CI 0.633-0.842), longer length of stay 
(OR 0.949, 95% CI 0.949-0.954), pathologic stage IIIA (0.547, 95% CI 
0.458-0.652), and <12.
LIMITATIONS: Administrative data source with inherent risks of bias, coding 
errors, and limitations in the fields available for analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival but 
was only used in 64.3% of older adults with stage III colon cancer. Adjuvant 
chemotherapy noncompliance was seen in the most vulnerable and highest risk 
patients, including those with greater co-morbidity, lower income, and patients 
who received open surgery. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/C125."
458,"OBJECTIVES: Toinvestigate liver carcinogenesis and other causes of death by 
collecting clinical data, including the Fib-4 index, from patients with 
successfully eradicated hepatitis C virus (HCV) by direct-acting antivirals 
(DAA) treatment.
METHODS: Patients ( n  = 690), who achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR) 
between 2014 and 2021, were identified and followed up for approximately 
6.8 years; 71 incident hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases were identified. The 
Fib-4 index was calculated at DAA-treatment initiation and HCV eradication, and 
its relationship with carcinogenesis and prognosis was analyzed.
RESULTS: The Fib-4 index was initially calculated and divided into three groups: 
Fib-4<1.45, 1.45 ≤ Fib-4<3.25, and 3.25 ≤ Fib-4 to develop HCC over time. On 
analysis, no carcinogenic cases were observed at Fib-4<1.45. In patients with a 
Fib-4 index ≥3.25, the initial HCC carcinogenic rate was higher than that in 
patients with Fib-4=1.45-3.25, and a significant difference was obtained between 
the two groups [ P  = 0.0057 (<1.45 vs. >3.25); P  = 0.0004 (<1.45-3.25 vs. 
>3.25)]. Regarding all 18 death and Fib-4 at treatment initiation, a significant 
difference was observed after stratification into two groups [Fib-4 < 3.25 and 
3.25 ≤ Fib-4; P  = 0.0136 (<3.25 vs. ≥3.25)]. Significant differences were 
obtained in another analysis of 13 deaths, not due to HCC.
CONCLUSIONS: The high Fib-4 index calculated at baseline and SVR12 significantly 
correlated not only with liver carcinogenesis but also with all mortality rates, 
including those due to causes other than liver cancer. Our findings suggest that 
improving liver fibrosis by eradicating HCV improves prognosis related to all 
etiologies."
459,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: An optimal sequential anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
agent that can be used after failed lenvatinib treatment has not been 
established. Here, we compared the outcomes of sorafenib and nivolumab as 
second-line agents after failed lenvatinib treatment in patients with advanced 
HCC.
METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC who had received sorafenib or nivolumab as 
second-line agents after failed lenvatinib treatment were recruited from two 
Korean tertiary institutions between November 2018 and June 2020.
RESULTS: The median age of the 60 participants (52 treated with sorafenib and 
eight treated with nivolumab) at baseline was 56.8 years. The demographic, 
laboratory and tumor variables, as well as lenvatinib treatment duration, were 
similar between the two groups. The median durations of sorafenib and nivolumab 
treatment were 1.2 and 2.6 months, respectively ( P  = 0.164). Twenty-four 
(40.0%) patients died during the follow-up period (median, 15.8 months). The 
median overall survival (OS) of the study population was 5.8 months. The median 
OS of patients treated with sorafenib was significantly longer than the median 
OS of patients treated with nivolumab (8.7 vs. 3.0 months; P  = 0.046). 
Sorafenib treatment (vs. nivolumab) was independently associated with a lower 
risk of mortality (hazard ratio = 0.194; 95% confidence interval, 0.053-0.708; P 
 = 0.013). Worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, larger 
maximal tumor size, lymph node metastases and higher total bilirubin levels were 
independently associated with increased mortality risk (all P  < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Lenvatinib-sorafenib sequential treatment resulted in significantly 
better survival did than lenvatinib-nivolumab sequential treatment in patients 
with advanced HCC. Larger studies are needed to validate our results."
460,"BACKGROUND: Serrate d polyps (SP) is associated with an increased risk of 
colorectal cancer. Patients with SP history tend to have SP recurrence. However, 
the risk factors for metachronous polyps (MP) in those patients are not well 
established.
METHODS: Data of colonoscopy were retrospectively reviewed from October 2012 to 
October 2021. The pathology database, electronic medical records and telephone 
follow-up data were also observed.
RESULTS: A total of 906 patients were studied including 278 patients with MPs 
and 628 patients without. The multiplicity of polyps (OR, 13.63; 95% CI, 
8.80-21.75), older age (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 1.87-20.63), abdominal obesity (OR, 
2.46; 95% CI, 0.98-6.42), current smoker (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.15-7.83) and 
sedentary lifestyle (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.22-1.65) are significantly associated 
with the risk of MPs. Patients with baseline SP < 10 mm were more likely to 
develop higher or same risk-grade polyps (HSRGP) ( P  = 0.0014). Patients with 
non-clinically significant SPs whether coexisted with adenoma or not were more 
likely to develop HSRGPs when compared to others ( P  < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Total number of polyps, older age, sedentary behavior, abdominal 
obesity and smoking status contributed to the risk of MPs at surveillance 
colonoscopy. Patients with grade 1 SPs might require closer surveillance. SPs 
coexisting with conventional adenoma did not increase the risk of MPs but may 
increase the risk of developing HSRGPs."
461,"OBJECTIVE: The first choice of treatment for rectal neuroendocrine tumors 
(R-NETs) 10 mm in size is endoscopic resection, there is still controversy 
concerning the optimal endoscopic treatment for resecting R-NETs. This study 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple ligation-assisted endoscopic 
submucosal resection combined with endoscopic ultrasonography (EMR-MLUS) for 
R-NETs.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 62 patients with R-NETs ≤10 mm 
in size who underwent EMR-MLUS or ligation-assisted endoscopic submucosal 
resection combined with endoscopic ultrasonography (EMR-LUS) between May 2019 
and April 2022, including tumor characteristics, endoscopic complete resection, 
pathological complete resection, the procedure time, adverse events, and 
follow-up were compared between the two groups of patients.
RESULTS: Of the 62 patients, 19 underwent EMR-MLUS and 43 underwent EMR-LUS. The 
endoscopic morphology of lesions was statistically different between group 
EMR-MLUS and group EMR-LUS ( P = 0.015), and most of them were flat and slightly 
raised lesions in group EMR-MLUS. Although the pathological complete resection 
rate was slightly higher in the EMR-MLUS group than in the EMR-LUS group (94.74% 
vs. 90.70%; P = 0.290), the endoscopic complete resection rate was high in both 
groups. Involvement of the lateral resection margin was found four cases in the 
ESMR-LUS group; one case of deep resection margin involvement in the EMR-MLUS 
group. The mean procedure time was longer in the EMR-MLUS group than in the 
EMR-LUS group (12.79 ± 1.01 min vs. 11.08 ± 1.89 min; P = 0.041). In group 
EMR-LUS, there were two cases of immediate bleeding; in group EMR-MLUS, one case 
of perforation, all of them were successfully treated by endoscopy. No 
recurrence, progression, or metastasis was found in all patients.
CONCLUSION: EMR-MLUS is a safe and effective technique that could be considered 
when removing small rectal NETs, especially flat and slightly raised lesions."
462,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The diagnostic role of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided 
fine needle aspiration (FNA) and fine needle biopsy (FNB) of pelvic masses has 
not been well established. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of EUS 
plus FNA/FNB in suspected local recurrence of pelvic masses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutive patients with a history of lower 
gastrointestinal and pelvic mass undergone EUS-FNA/FNB were included in the 
study.
RESULTS: In total 34 patients who underwent EUS-guided FNA or FNB of a 
perirectal mass were enrolled. The sampled lesion was a mass in 22 patients 
(64.7%) and a lymph node in 10 patients (29.4%). The univariate logistic 
regression analysis for diagnostic accuracy showed lesion size as a significant 
predictor of diagnostic accuracy [odds ratio (OR), 1.61; 1.08-2.27; P  = 0.02]. 
Diagnostic sensitivity was 100% (71.5-100%) with EUS-FNB and 75% (34.9-96.8%) 
with EUS-FNA ( P  = 0.12); specificity was 100% in both groups ( P  = 1.0). 
Sample adequacy was 94.1% in the whole cohort, with 20/20 adequacy rate (100%) 
in the EUS-FNB group and 12/14 (85.7%) in the EUS-FNA group ( P  = 0.28).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study demonstrating the diagnostic yield of EUS 
plus FNA/FNB in patients with pelvic masses comparing the two needles. Our 
results highlight the relevance of this technique, especially in undefined 
masses during oncological follow-up."
463,"Liver fibrosis has a high incidence worldwide and is the common pathological 
basis of many chronic liver diseases. Liver fibrosis is caused by the excessive 
deposition of extracellular matrix and concomitant collagen accumulation in 
livers and can lead to the development of liver cirrhosis and even liver cancer. 
A large number of studies have provided evidence that liver fibrosis can be 
blocked or even reversed by appropriate medical interventions. However, the 
antifibrosis drugs with ideal clinical efficacy are still insufficient. The 
edible plant-derived natural compounds have been reported to exert effective 
antifibrotic effects with few side-effects, representing a kind of promising 
source for the treatment of liver fibrosis. In this article, we reviewed the 
current progress of the natural compounds derived from dietary plants in the 
treatment of liver fibrosis, including phenolic compounds (capsaicin, 
chlorogenic acid, curcumin, ellagic acid, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, 
resveratrol, sinapic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid and vitamin E), 
flavonoid compounds (genistein, hesperidin, hesperetin, naringenin, naringin and 
quercetin), sulfur-containing compounds (S-allylcysteine, ergothioneine, lipoic 
acid and sulforaphane) and other compounds (betaine, caffeine, cucurbitacin B, 
lycopene, α-mangostin, γ-mangostin, ursolic acid, vitamin C and yangonin). The 
pharmacological effects and related mechanisms of these compounds in in-vivo and 
in-vitro models of liver fibrosis are focused."
464,"T helper 17 (Th17) cells have a prominent role in autoimmune diseases. In 
contrast, the nature of these cells in cancer is controversial, with either pro 
or anti-tumorigenic activities depending on various cancer settings. Chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a B-cell malignancy, is characterized by an 
imbalance in T-cell immune responses contributing to disease progression and 
increased mortality. Many clinical reports indicate an increase in Th17 cells 
and/or IL-17 serum cytokine levels in CLL patients compared to healthy 
individuals which correlates with various prognostic markers and significant 
changes in the tumor microenvironment. The exact mechanisms by which Th17 might 
contribute to CLL progression is still less investigated. In this review, we 
provide an updated presentation of the clinical information related to the 
significance of Th17 cells in CLL, and their interaction with the complex 
leukemic microenvironment including various mediators, immune and non-immune 
cells. Herein, we also address the available data regarding the effects of CLL 
targeted therapies on Th17 cells, and the potential of using these cells in 
adoptive cell therapies. Having a sound understanding of the role played by Th17 
in CLL is crucial for designing novel therapies that can achieve immune 
homeostasis and maximize clinical benefits."
465,"BACKGROUND: Recent data show an increasing number of abdominal surgeries being 
performed for the treatment of nonmalignant colorectal polyps in the West but in 
settings where colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection is not routinely 
performed. This study evaluated the number of nonmalignant colorectal lesions 
referred to surgical treatment in a tertiary cancer center that incorporated 
magnification chromoendoscopy and endoscopic submucosal dissection as part of 
the standard management of complex colorectal polyps.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to estimate the number of patients with nonmalignant 
colorectal lesions referred to surgical resection at our institution after the 
standardization of routine endoscopic submucosal dissection and to describe 
outcomes for patients undergoing colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection.
DESIGN: Single-center retrospective study from prospectively collected database 
of endoscopic submucosal dissections and colorectal surgeries performed between 
January 2016 and December 2019.
SETTINGS: Reference cancer center.
PATIENTS: Consecutive adult patients with complex nonmalignant colorectal 
polyps.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients with nonmalignant colorectal polyps treated by 
endoscopic submucosal dissection or surgery (elective colectomy, 
rectosigmoidectomy, low anterior resection, or proctocolectomy).
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the percentage of 
patients referred to colorectal surgery for non-malignant lesions.
RESULTS: In the period, 1.1% of 825 colorectal surgeries were performed for 
nonmalignant lesions, and 97 complex polyps were endoscopically removed by 
endoscopic submucosal dissection. The en bloc, R0, and curative resection rates 
of endoscopic submucosal dissection were 91.7%, 83.5%, and 81.4%, respectively. 
The mean tumor size was 59 (SD 37.8) mm. Perforations during endoscopic 
submucosal dissection occurred in 3 cases, all treated with clipping. One 
patient presented with a delayed perforation 2 days after the endoscopic 
resection and underwent surgery. The mean follow-up period was 3 years, with no 
tumor recurrence in this cohort.
LIMITATIONS: Single-center retrospective study.
CONCLUSIONS: A workflow that includes assessment of the lesions with 
magnification chromoendoscopy and resection through endoscopic submucosal 
dissection can lead to a very low rate of abdominal surgery for nonmalignant 
colorectal lesions. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/C123."
466,"BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health (SDoH), such as geographic 
neighborhoods, access to health care, education, and social structure, are 
important factors affecting people's health and health outcomes. The SDoH of 
patients are scarcely documented in a discrete format in electronic health 
records (EHRs) but are often available in free-text clinical narratives such as 
physician notes. Innovative methods like natural language processing (NLP) are 
being developed to identify and extract SDoH from EHRs, but it is imperative 
that the input of key stakeholders is included as NLP systems are designed.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the feasibility, challenges, and 
benefits of developing an NLP system to uncover SDoH from clinical narratives by 
conducting interviews with key stakeholders: (1) oncologists, (2) data analysts, 
(3) citizen scientists, and (4) patient navigators.
METHODS: Individuals who frequently work with SDoH data were invited to 
participate in semistructured interviews. All interviews were recorded and 
subsequently transcribed. After coding transcripts and developing a codebook, 
the constant comparative method was used to generate themes.
RESULTS: A total of 16 participants were interviewed (5 data analysts, 4 patient 
navigators, 4 physicians, and 3 citizen scientists). Three main themes emerged, 
accompanied by subthemes. The first theme, importance and approaches to 
obtaining SDoH, describes how every participant (n=16, 100%) regarded SDoH as 
important. In particular, proximity to the hospital and income levels were 
frequently relied upon. Communication about SDoH typically occurs during the 
initial conversation with the oncologist, but more personal information is often 
acquired by patient navigators. The second theme, SDoH exists in numerous forms, 
exemplified how SDoH arises during informal communication and can be difficult 
to enter into the EHR. The final theme, incorporating SDoH into health services 
research, addresses how more informed SDoH can be collected. One strategy is to 
empower patients so they are aware about the importance of SDoH, as well as 
employing NLP techniques to make narrative data available in a discrete format, 
which can provide oncologists with actionable data summaries.
CONCLUSIONS: Extracting SDoH from EHRs was considered valuable and necessary, 
but obstacles such as narrative data format can make the process difficult. NLP 
can be a potential solution, but as the technology is developed, it is important 
to consider how key stakeholders document SDoH, apply the NLP systems, and use 
the extracted SDoH in health outcome studies."
467,"Post mastectomy reconstruction is nowadays an integral part of breast cancer 
treatment, usually performed in the immediate setting. Among women with 
hereditary gastric and breast cancer syndromes, three different scenarios can be 
identified. First, healthy women seeking for prophylactic mastectomies. Second, 
cancer patients requiring mastectomy at the tumor site and simultaneous risk 
reducing mastectomy of the healthy breast. Third, cancer patients who have been 
treated for primary cancer requiring risk reducing mastectomies in a further 
stage. In this paper, we present a schematic guide for reconstruction for each 
subpopulation of subjects and their peculiarities."
468,"BACKGROUND: A steady increase in colorectal and prostate cancer survivors and 
patients with these cancers is expected in the upcoming years. As a result of 
primary cancer treatments, patients have numerous additional complaints, 
increasing the need for cancer aftercare. However, referrals to appropriate 
cancer aftercare remain inadequate, despite a wide range of aftercare options. 
Caregivers and patients often do not know which aftercare is the most 
appropriate for the individual patient. Since characteristics and complaints of 
patients within a diagnosis group may differ, predefined patient clusters could 
provide substantive and efficient support for professionals in the conversation 
about aftercare. By using advanced data analysis methods, clusters of patients 
who are different from one another within a diagnosis group can be identified.
OBJECTIVE: This study had a 2-fold objective: (1) to identify, visualize, and 
describe potential patient clusters within the colorectal and prostate cancer 
population and (2) to explore the potential usability of these clusters in 
clinical practice.
METHODS: First, we used cross-sectional data from patients with colorectal 
cancer and patients with prostate cancer provided by the population-based 
PROFILES (Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long-Term 
Evaluation of Survivorship) registry, which were originally collected between 
2008 and 2012. To identify and visualize different clusters among the 2 patient 
populations, we conducted cluster analyses by applying the K-means algorithm and 
multiple-factor analyses. Second, in a qualitative study, we presented the 
patient clusters to patients with prostate, patients with colorectal cancer, and 
oncology professionals. To assess the usability of these clusters, we held 
expert panel group interviews. The interviews were video recorded and 
transcribed. Three researchers independently performed content-directed data 
analyses to understand and describe the qualitative data. Quotes illustrate the 
most important results.
RESULTS: We identified 3 patient clusters among colorectal cancer cases (n=3989) 
and 5 patient clusters among prostate cancer cases (n=696), which were described 
in tabular form. Patient experts (6/8, 75%) and professional experts (17/20, 
85%) recognized the patient clustering based on distinguishing variables. 
However, the tabular form was evaluated as less applicable in clinical practice. 
Instead, the experts suggested the development of a conversation tool (eg, 
decision tree) to guide professionals through the hierarchy of variables. In 
addition, participants suggested that information about possible aftercare 
initiatives should be offered and integrated. This would also ensure a good 
overview and seemed to be a precondition for finding suitable aftercare.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a fully data-driven approach can be 
used to identify distinguishable and recognizable (ie, in routine care) patient 
clusters in large data sets within cancer populations. Patient clusters can be a 
source of support for health professionals in the aftercare conversation. These 
clusters, when integrated into a smart digital conversation and referral tool, 
might be an opportunity to improve referral to cancer aftercare.

469,"Aim To examine and quantify patients' satisfaction and correlate with the 
objective clinical presentation after the treatment and to present a 
comprehensive literature review on tarsoconjunctival/ Hughes flap technique. 
Methods A review of more than 159 peer-review articles and a combined 
retrospective-prospective two-centres case series of 17 patients who underwent a 
two-stage modified Hughes flap procedure (2019-2021) to repair a lower eyelid 
defect caused by epithelial cancer was conducted. All patients were followed up 
for a minimum of six months. Patient macroscopic evaluation of redness, lid 
position, retraction, trichiasis, conjunctival overgrowth, tissue 
inflammation/infection and hypertrophic scarring were obtained, and findings 
were graded on a scale of 1 to 5 or binary YES/NO scale. Patients' satisfaction 
using a Likert-type scale and correlation with the clinical presentation were 
analysed. Results Pearson correlation coefficient between patients' satisfaction 
and clinical presentation was 0.534. Out of 510 (the highest summed score for 
patients' satisfaction), the total score was 479 (93.9%); out of 187 (the 
highest summed score for clinical presentation), the total score was 162 
(86.6%). Although both scores were high, a lower correlation coefficient and the 
higher satisfaction score can be explained by more realistic expectations in 
oncological patients compared to cosmetic ones. Conclusion Hughes flaps provide 
multiple benefits in the reconstruction of selected patients with large defects, 
especially when poor wound healing is expected, or when local advancement flaps 
do not provide tension-free reconstruction. The rate of complications is low and 
manageable, whereas additional therapy is usually observational or symptomatic."
470,"Limitation of excessive inflammation due to selective degradation of 
pro-inflammatory proteins is one of the cytoprotective functions attributed to 
autophagy. In the current study, we highlight that selective autophagy also 
plays a vital role in promoting the establishment of a robust inflammatory 
response. Under inflammatory conditions, here TLR3-activation by poly(I:C) 
treatment, the inflammation repressor TNIP1 (TNFAIP3 interacting protein 1) is 
phosphorylated by Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) activating an LIR motif that 
leads to the selective autophagy-dependent degradation of TNIP1, supporting the 
expression of pro-inflammatory genes and proteins. This selective autophagy 
efficiently reduces TNIP1 protein levels early (0-4 h) upon poly(I:C) treatment 
to allow efficient initiation of the inflammatory response. At 6 h, TNIP1 levels 
are restored due to increased transcription avoiding sustained inflammation. 
Thus, similarly as in cancer, autophagy may play a dual role in controlling 
inflammation depending on the exact state and timing of the inflammatory 
response."
471,"BACKGROUND: In this study, the authors sought to describe the cytologic features 
of primary gynecologic germ cell tumors and carcinomas exhibiting germ cell 
differentiation because little information currently exists.
METHODS: An institutional database search was performed to identify 
histologically confirmed gynecologic germ cell tumors and carcinomas with germ 
cell tumor differentiation. Available cytologic material was reviewed by three 
observers, and morphologic features were recorded in addition to patient age at 
original diagnosis, primary tumor site, site(s) from which the examined 
cytologic material was obtained, and the type of examined cytologic 
preparations.
RESULTS: In total, 15 cytologic specimens from 12 women (aged 19-82 years) were 
identified and included touch preparations of core biopsies from various sites 
(n = 6), fine-needle biopsies (n = 2), pelvic washings (n = 1), ascitic fluids 
(n = 4), pelvic cyst fluid (n = 1), and endometrial aspirate (n = 1). Of the 12 
patients, seven had primary gynecologic germ cell tumors, four had gynecologic 
(ovarian and endometrial) tumors exhibiting somatic yolk sac tumor-like 
differentiation, and the remaining patient had an intestinal-type adenocarcinoma 
arising within an ovarian teratoma. There was morphologic overlap among many of 
the cases, although cytoplasmic vacuolation/granular cytoplasm was seen in 75% 
of primary yolk sac tumors or carcinomas with yolk sac tumor differentiation, 
and dense/squamoid cytoplasm was seen in 100% of teratomatous elements that were 
sampled.
CONCLUSIONS: Germ cell tumors and somatic neoplasms exhibiting germ cell tumor 
differentiation occurring in adult women share some cytologic features and may 
be difficult to distinguish from one another, although some tumor types showed 
characteristic cytomorphologic findings."
472,"Myelodysplastic neoplasms, formerly known as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 
represent a group of clonal disorders characterized by a high degree of clinical 
and molecular heterogeneity, and an invariable tendency to progress to acute 
myeloid leukemia. MDS typically present in the elderly with cytopenias of 
different degrees and bone marrow dysplasia, the hallmarks of the disease. 
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is the sole curative approach to 
date. Nonetheless, given the disease's demographics, only a minority of patients 
can benefit from this procedure. Currently used prognostic schemes such as the 
Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (R-IPSS), and most recently the 
molecular IPSS (IPSS-M), guide clinical management by dividing MDS into two big 
categories: lower- and higher-risk cases, based on a cut-off score of 3.5. The 
main clinical problem of the lower-risk group is represented by the management 
of cytopenias, whereas the prevention of secondary leukemia progression is the 
goal for the latter. Herein, we discuss the non-transplant treatment of MDS, 
focusing on current practice and available therapeutic options, while also 
presenting new investigational agents potentially entering the MDS therapeutic 
arsenal in the near future."
473,"PURPOSE: Our study aimed to examine whether receipt of follow-up care plans is 
associated with greater guideline-concordant CRC screening stratified by breast, 
prostate, and lung cancer survivors.
METHODS: We used data from years 2016, 2018, and 2020 of the Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System on 3339 eligible treatment-utilizing cancer survivors 
with complete treatment. We performed descriptive statistics and multivariable 
logistic regression to examine the mentioned association.
RESULTS: We observed that 83.9% of breast and 88.2% of prostate cancer survivors 
with follow-care plans received CRC screening (p-value < 0.001). The lowest CRC 
screening use was observed among lung cancer (70.8%). In multivariable analysis, 
receipt of follow-up care plans was strongly associated with greater odds of 
receiving CRC screening in breast (OR, 2.67; 95% CI: 1.71-4.16) and prostate 
(OR, 3.81; 95% CI: 2.30-6.31) cancer survivors. Regardless of provider type, 84 
to 88% reduced likelihood of receipt of CRC screening when they received 
follow-up care plans among lung cancer survivors. Among those without follow-up 
care plans, breast (OR, 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09-0.92) and lung (OR, 0.05; 95% CI: 
0.01-0.25) cancer survivors who received care from general practices were less 
likely to receive CRC screening compared to those who received care from 
non-general practices.
CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of follow-up care plans was associated with greater CRC 
screening use in breast and prostate cancers. Lung cancer survivors demonstrated 
lower screening use despite receipt of follow-up care plans.
IMPLICATION FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Patient and provider communication regarding 
CRC screening recommendation should be included in their follow-up care plans."
474,"A 47-year-old female who was previously treated for BRCA1 germline mutant breast 
cancer presented with increasing back pain. Radiological and pathological 
investigations led to the diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with 
multiple hepatic metastases. Serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels were highly 
elevated at 14,784 U/mL (normal, < 37 U/mL). After nine cycles of FOLFIRINOX 
treatment, radiological findings revealed remarkable shrinkage of the primary 
pancreatic tumor, disappearance of hepatic metastases, and normalized levels of 
carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels. Because of increased neuropathy following 
FOLFIRINOX treatment, the patient was switched to maintenance olaparib 
treatment. Ten months later, her radiological response and normalized 
carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels were stable. After staging laparoscopy, the 
patient underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy as a conversion surgery. 
Histopathological examination revealed no signs of residual adenocarcinoma in 
the resected pancreatic specimens, which was diagnosed as a pathological 
complete response. The patient recovered without complications. Adjuvant 
olaparib treatment was administered with no signs of recurrence at 7 months 
after surgery. In conclusion, a pathologic complete response after FOLFIRINOX 
and olaparib maintenance treatment in hepatic metastasized pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma is extremely rare. These bridging treatments may contribute to 
increased surgical resection rates and improved survival rates."
475,"Uncertainty is prevalent in various health contexts. It is imperative to 
understand how health-related uncertainty can impact individuals' healthcare 
experiences and health decision making. The purpose of the present paper is to 
provide five overarching recommendations from an interdisciplinary team of

present a case study of health-related uncertainty within the specific context 
of alcohol use to demonstrate these gaps and provide context for the 
recommendations. The five recommendations concerning health-related uncertainty 
include: (1) use common, consistent terminology to discuss uncertainty, (2) 
clarify measures of individual differences in response to uncertainty, (3) 
increase research on uncertainty and affect, (4) investigate the impact of the 
channel through which uncertainty is communicated, and (5) develop theory-driven 
interventions to improve uncertainty management. We conclude by reviewing health

recommendations complement existing reviews and data."
476,"The rarity and biological heterogeneity of the peripheral T-cell lymphomas has 
made subtype- and biomarker-driven approaches challenging to realize and even 
more challenging to evaluate in clinical practice. Out of necessity, treatment 
of T-cell lymphomas has historically been derivative of other aggressive 
lymphomas, utilizing intensive combination chemotherapy programs in the upfront 
setting and non-overlapping cytotoxic regimens upon relapse. However, due to 
tremendous work in understanding the oncogenic basis of these varied diseases, 
an increasing exploration of rational, targeted therapies is underway. Still, 
clinical successes have at times lagged behind pathobiological realizations, and 
there is an evolving need for biologically based, subtype-specific strategies in 
the clinic. Herein we propose a framework for future success that relies upon 
optimizing standard therapy in populations known to benefit from combination 
chemotherapy, building upon CHOP (or CHOP-like) induction with the CHOP + X 
model, exploring the use of targeted platforms in the relapsed and refractory 
setting, and designing biomarker-informed clinical trials that target-specific 
subhistologies and unique molecular subsets."
477,"BACKGROUND: Preoperative treatment is performed for locally advanced colon 
cancer with extensive tumor proximity or suspected invasion of skeletal muscles, 
major organs, and blood vessels. Oxaliplatin-based regimens are often used in 
preoperative chemotherapy. However, microsatellite instability (MSI)-high 
colorectal cancer is often resistant to cytotoxic anticancer agents. Herein, we 
describe a case of treatment of anticancer drug-resistant MSI-high locally 
advanced colon cancer and review cases of complete response to immune checkpoint 
inhibitor therapy for colorectal cancer.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a large 
tumor in the descending colon and extensive thoracic and abdominal wall 
involvement, including the ribs and diaphragm. No distant metastasis was 
observed. The tumor had perforated the abdominal wall and formed an abscess. 
Upon visiting our hospital, emergency surgery was performed. An abdominal wall 
incision was made to drain the abscess and laparoscopic colostomy was performed. 
Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens revealed an adenocarcinoma 
with positive immunohistochemical expressions of both CDX2 and CK20. The patient 
was diagnosed with a descending colon cancer. Genetic examination found 
MSI-high, Kras mutation (F12G), and wild-type BRAF. After the inflammation 
improved, chemotherapy with the FOLFIRI regimen was initiated, but the tumor 
grew rapidly. As a second-line treatment, nivolumab and ipilimumab combination 
therapy was initiated. After four cycles of these therapies, the patient was 
administered nivolumab alone for five cycles. Tumor shrinkage was observed and 
radical surgery was performed. The patient underwent laparoscopic descending 
colon and partial thoracic and abdominal wall resection. The abdominal wall 
muscle was dissected from the abdominal cavity, and subcutaneous tissues, 
diaphragm, ribs were dissected from the body surface. Pathological examination 
revealed mucus components, fibrous tissues, and no malignant cells, indicating a 
complete pathological response (pCR). The patient had a good postoperative 
course and returned to work after being discharged. No recurrence was observed 
six months postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we report a case of anticancer drug-resistant MSI-high 
colon cancer that was resected after treatment with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, and a pCR was achieved. This new treatment strategy can be used for 
the treatment of cases that are not responsive to conventional therapies."
478,"BACKGROUND: Mondia whitei root is often used in Africa as a local therapeutic 
agent for libido enhancement. The fractions of the M. whitei leaves (MWL) lack 
chemical characterization of their bioactive components and possible molecular 
targets. We characterized and investigated its molecular target as therapeutic 
agents in an in vitro and in silico assay. Mineral compositions, antioxidant, 
and GC-MS characterization were studied. The cytotoxicity effect was measured on 
HeLa and HT-29 cells by MTT assay. In silico potential inhibitors of Cathepsin B 
(CathB) as a cancer biomarker were determined.
RESULTS: The flame photometry produced marked Na+ and K+. GC-MS revealed 
eighteen bioactive components. The fractions (chloroformic 47.00, ethanolic 
45.52, and aqueous 40.13) of MWL caused a higher inhibition ratio compared to 
standards. The MWL showed a significant cytotoxic effect on the treated cell 
lines at concentrations of 150 and 200 μg/ml and 100, 150, and 200 μg/ml for 
HT-29 and HeLa cells, respectively. Ten bioactives (MWL 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 
15, 17, and 18) showed potential inhibition of CathB with binding affinities of 
-4.40 to -8.3 Kcal/Mol. However, MWL 4, 9, 14, and 17 which have higher binding 
affinities (-6.7, -7.1, -8.2, and -8.3, respectively) than the standard 
inhibitor (-6.5) were the lead molecules.
CONCLUSION: These chemical profiles and potential molecular targets unraveled in 
this study propose that MWL has a promising anticancer activity."
479,"INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a heterogeneous malignancy with 
dismal prognosis. However, few studies have conducted on the metabolic 
heterogeneity in SCLC.
OBJECTIVE: We therefore identify SCLC classifications using untargeted 
metabolomics and lipidomics. We also compared their survival and the 
immunotherapy responses.
METHODS: Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
analysis was performed in 191 SCLC serum samples. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) analysis was conducted to identify metabolic pathways. The 
Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test were used to analyze the survival curves. The 
univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used 
to evaluate prognostic factors for OS in patients with SCLC.
RESULTS: Distinct subtypes of SCLC were identified by consensus clustering 
algorithm using partioning around medoids (pam) based on untargeted metabolomics 
and lipidomics. Four distinct subtypes of SCLC were identified, with distinct 
metabolic pathways. Subgroup 2 had the longest survival whereas Subgroup 1 had 
the shortest. Subtype 2 benefited most from immunotherapy in OS, as in contrast 
to Subtype 3 with shortest survival.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the metabolic heterogeneity in SCLC and 
identified four subtypes with distinct metabolic features. It indicates 
promising therapeutic and prognostic value that may guide treatment for SCLC. 
The subtype-specific clinical trials may be designed and would be instructive 
for drug development."
480,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a known mimicker of pancreatic 
ductal adenocarcinoma both clinically and radiologically. In this study, the 
authors present their institutional experience in diagnosing AIP on cytology and 
correlate results with the histologic findings.
METHODS: A 14-year computerized search for patients who had histologically 
confirmed AIP with concurrent or prior cytology was performed. Clinical data, 
cytology findings, and surgical pathology results were reviewed for analysis.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients were identified. The patients showed a male 
predominance, with a mean age of 59 years. Jaundice, weight loss, and abdominal 
pain were the most common clinical presentation. Five of 12 patients who were 
tested for serum immunoglobulin G4 had elevated levels. Cytologic findings of 16 
cases that were available for review showed markedly inflamed fibrous stroma 
(54%) and cytologic atypia (50%). The final cytologic diagnoses were suspicious 
for adenocarcinoma (n = 1), atypical (n = 8), and benign/negative (n = 9). The 
corresponding surgical pathology diagnoses were classified as type 1 (n = 10), 
type 2 (n = 6), and AIP, not otherwise specified (n = 2). All type 2 AIP cases 
had at least atypical cytologic diagnoses, with one called suspicious for 
adenocarcinoma and another called adenocarcinoma at the time of rapid on-site 
evaluation. In contrast, eight of 10 type 1 AIP cases were negative/benign, and 
two of 10 were atypical. In these two atypical cases, the possibility of AIP was 
raised because of the presence of inflamed stroma."
481,"Prostate cancer (PCa) has long been the leading cause of cancer-associated 
deaths among male worldwide. Our previous studies have shown that Bloom syndrome 
protein (BLM) plays a vital role in PCa proliferation, yet the underlying 
molecular mechanism remains largely obscure. Mechanistically, BLM directly 
interacted with hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF). Functionally, BLM and 
HDGF knockdown resulted in the higher impairment of PC3 proliferation, 
clonogenicity, migration and invasion than that their counterpart with either 
BLM or HDGF knockdown exclusively. Of note, HDGF overexpression expedited, 
whereas its knockdown suppressed, PC3 proliferation, clonogenicity, migration 
and invasion. Additionally, the potentiation or attenuation was partially 
antagonized upon BLM depletion or overexpression. In line with the vitro data, 
the impact of BLM and HDGF on tumor growth was investigated in mouse xenograft 
models. ChIP-seq, dual-luciferase reporter and western blotting assays were 
employed to expound the regulatory network in PC3 cells. The results unveiled 
that HDGF activated KRAS and suppressed RhoA transcription, and that the 
function of HDGF was mediated, in part, by interaction with BLM. Accordingly, 
the MAPK/ERK pathway was activated. Moreover, the regulation of HDGF on KRAS and 
RhoA had a signal crosstalk. To recapitulate, BLM and HDGF may serve as novel 
prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets in PCa."
482,"BACKGROUND: The optimal extent of lymph-node (LN) dissection in esophageal 
cancer has not been established. Although the frequency and patterns of 
recurrence in each regional LN station after radical dissection are important in 
determining the regional LNs of thoracic esophageal cancer to be routinely 
dissected, this information has not been investigated sufficiently. We studied 
the significance of dissection at each LN station based on their recurrence 
patterns.
METHODS: Six hundred and twelve patients with esophageal cancer who underwent 
curative esophagectomy were studied. The incidence and pattern of recurrence 
(systemic or non-systemic) at each regional LN station were analyzed. To compare 
the significance of dissection among regional LNs, the efficacy index (EI) was 
also calculated.
RESULTS: Regional LN recurrence was diagnosed in 101 (16.5%) patients. Among the 
regional LNs, recurrent laryngeal nerve, paraesophageal, and perigastric LNs 
showed higher EIs (3.1-6.7). Pretracheal and posterior thoracic para-aortic LNs 
showed low EIs (0-0.2). Supraclavicular LNs had moderate EIs (1.7-2.0). The 
recurrence rate was highest in the pretracheal LN, followed by the 
supraclavicular LNs. The majority (81.8%) of the pretracheal LN had a systemic 
recurrence, while about half (right: 60.0%, left: 43.8%) of the supraclavicular 
LNs had a systemic recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Due to the high incidence of systemic recurrence or low EI for 
pretracheal and posterior thoracic para-aortic LNs, we suggest that these LN 
stations be regarded as non-regional LNs and be excluded from routine 
dissection. Supraclavicular LNs may also be excluded from routinely dissected 
stations."
483,"Extraction and characterization of natural products provide the opportunity to 
expand our arsenal of drug candidates against a wide range of diseases including 
cancer and inflammatory disorders. Previous studies have shown bee venom to have 
immense potential as an anti-inflammatory drug candidate. In this study, we 
focused on the venom of Apis mellifera anatoliaca and characterized its content 
by HPLC. An in vitro inflammation model based on lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-stimulated mammalian macrophages was utilized to examine the venom's 
anti-inflammatory potential. Additionally, its antiproliferative activity was 
evaluated in vitro against a human glioblastoma cell line. Based on the TNF, 
IL6, GMCSF, and IL12p40 pro-inflammatory cytokine production level in 
LPS-induced macrophages, venom-treated groups showed substantial decrease in the 
inflammatory action compared to untreated LPS-stimulated macrophages. When the 
cells were analyzed for viability, the venom did not have any cytotoxic effect 
on the macrophages at the concentration ranges that were utilized. Moreover, 
IC50 value of the venom was above 60 µg/mL on glioblastoma cancer cell line. 
These results suggest that the Apis mellifera anatoliaca venom does not have 
anticancer drug candidate potential, whereas it can efficiently be used against 
inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. To our knowledge, this is the first study 
to specifically examine the effect of anti-inflammatory activity of Apis 
mellifera anatoliaca venom on macrophages."
484,"BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of renal impairment in patients with cancer remains 
unclear. We aimed to clarify associations between various cancer sites and renal 
impairment.
METHODS: We reviewed data from 5674 patients aged ≥ 18 years receiving cancer 
treatment at a single hospital facility. The primary endpoints were the 
occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI), a 30% decrease in the estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or death. Survival time was defined as the 
time from study enrolment to AKI occurrence. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional 
hazard analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Hazard ratios (HRs) for AKI occurrence and a ≥ 30% decline in eGFR were 
significantly higher for kidney, urinary tract, pancreatic, liver, and 
gallbladder cancers than for colon cancer. Compared with colon cancer, digestive 
tract cancer showed a significantly higher HR for AKI occurrence alone. The HRs 
for a ≥ 30% decline in eGFR were significantly higher for patients aged 
71‒77 years or ≥ 78 years than for those aged < 68 years, and for patients with 
eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 or 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2 than for those with 
eGFR = 45‒59 mL/min/1.73 m2.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney, urinary, hepatobiliary, or pancreatic cancer are associated 
with a higher risk of AKI development and eGFR decrease than other cancers. 
Renal function changes should be more closely monitored in patients with these 
cancers."
485,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a specialized circular structure, are deregulated 
in cancers and play essential roles in biological processes involved in tumor 
progression. However, the mechanism by which circRNAs affect lung tumorigenesis 
and progression remains largely unexplored. To investigate the role of circRNA 
in lung cancer, circRNA expression profile was screened by bioinformatics 
analysis. The levels of circTAB2, miR-3142, and GLIS family zinc finger 2 
(GLIS2) were measured by quantitate real-time (qRT-PCR) or western blot. Cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were detected by EdU, flow 
cytometry, and transwell assays, respectively. Bioinformatics, western blot, 
RIP, pull down, dual luciferase reporter and rescue experiments were used to 
verify the direct relationship between miR-3142 and circTAB2 or GLIS2. The 
xenograft assays were used to assess the role of circTAB2 in vivo.CircTAB2 
exhibited low expression in cancer tissues. Gain and loss-of-function assays 
indicated that circTAB2 could inhibit cell proliferation, migration and 
invasion. Functional studies revealed that circTAB2 acted as a miRNA sponge, 
directly interacted with miR-3142 and consequently regulated GLIS2 /AKT. Taken 
together, circTAB2 serves as an inhibitory role in lung cancer through a novel 
circTAB2 /miR-3142 /GLIS2 /AKT pathway and could be exploited a novel marker in 
lung cancer."
486,"PURPOSE: While many factors have been correlated with lesser outcomes in 
abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR), the impact of surgeon experience has yet to 
be elucidated. We sought to evaluate the effect of cumulative surgeon experience 
on long-term complex AWR outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review of all consecutive patients who 
underwent AWR using biologic mesh for the repair of ventral hernias or tumor 
resection defects from March 2005 to June 2019. The primary outcome measure was 
hernia recurrence (HR). Secondary outcomes were surgical site occurrences (SSOs) 
and surgical site infections (SSIs). Patients were a priori categorized into the 
following groups according to the cumulative number of hernia repairs performed 
by their surgeons: low (< 50), moderate experience (50-100), and high (> 100) 
experience.
RESULTS: We identified 60 surgeons and 650 consecutive patients (62% women) who 
met our inclusion criteria. In adjusted models, AWR performed by surgeons with 
high experience was associated with a fourfold lower risk of HR (hazard ratio, 
0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.08 to 0.87), but the odds of surgical site 
occurrences (odds ratio, 0.72, 95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 1.52) and 
surgical site infections (odds ratio, 0.89, 95% confidence interval, 0.26 to 
2.86) did not differ significantly in the high-experience group.
CONCLUSIONS: High surgical experience, defined as > 100 cumulative hernia 
repairs, is predictive for markedly lower HR rates in complex AWR. These 
findings have potential implications for preoperative risk assessment, 
patient-centered surgeon selection, regulatory oversight, specific referral 
patterns, designations of centers of excellence, and individual provider or 
trainee quality improvement."
487,"PURPOSE: Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world after 
cardiovascular disease. The present study aimed to investigate the affordability 
and physical access to chemotherapy drugs among patients with one of the three 
common cancers of the breast, stomach, and colon in the city of Mashhad, Iran, 
in 2021.
METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study. Twenty drug stores 
including two public and 18 privates in Mashhad were evaluated. Data was 
collected by consistent stay in the drug stores or pharmacies. For each oncology 
medicine, selling price, lowest general price, and availability were 
investigated. Three approaches have been experimented to calculate the 
affordability of anticancer medicines in this study.
RESULTS: Out of 28 studied medicines from public and private drug stores, 15 
(53.5%) received very low, 8 (28.5%) relatively high, and 2 (7%) high access 
scores. The generic docetaxel brand's ultra-drug and trastuzumab (AryoTrust) 
were the most available drugs, but the doxorubicin (Ebewe), oxaliplatin (Mylan), 
and trastuzumab (Herceptin) were not available to the individuals with cancer. 
Also, the first approach (based on income decile) indicated that insured 
patients from all income deciles were able to pay the costs of the lowest price 
drugs of the DCF drug regimen, and if the patients were insured and belonged to 
the ninth income decile, they had the financial ability to buy drugs at the 
lowest price of the FLO drug regimen.
CONCLUSION: Unaffordability of cancer medicines can lead to treatment 
abandonment and increase inequality in access to healthcare services. Therefore, 
this requires immediate attention of policy makers to be planned in order to 
ensure to reducing the costs of medicines for patients and increasing patient 
access to anticancer medicines."
488,"Prostate cancer, one of the major causes of mortality globally is regarded as 
the second leading cause of mortality among men. It is known to affect the 
stromal cells surrounding it. Through the use of exosomes, the affected stromal 
cells can promote the growth and spread of the cancer. Exosomes are known to 
play a role not only in the development and progression of cancer but also 
contribute to the drug-resistance character of cancer cells. Recently, the 
discovery of the small non-coding RNAs or miRNA has attracted attention of 
cancer researchers as they can regulate the expression of different genes. 
Therefore, exosomal miRNA can be used as a novel and reliable biomarker for the 
diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. In addition, exosomal miRNAs can 
also be used as a potential treatment for prostate cancer. The goal of this 
review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current knowledge about the 
role of exosomal miRNAs in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer and 
their potential role in monitoring the disease."
489,"Cancer is a prevalent cause of mortality globally, where early diagnosis leads 
to a reduced death rate. Many researchers' common strategies are based on 
personalized diagnostic methods with rapid response and high accuracy. This 
technology was developed by applying liquid biopsy instead of tissue biopsies in 
the case of tumor cell analysis that facilitates point-of-care testing for 
cancer diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, significant progress in 
microfluidic technology led to the successful isolation, analysis, and 
monitoring of cancer biomarkers in body liquid biopsy with merits like high 
sensitivity and flexibility, low sample usage, cost effective, and the ability 
of automation. The most critical and informative markers in body liquid refer to 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and extracellular vesicles derived from tumors 
(EVs) that carry various biomarkers in their structure (DNAs, proteins, and 
RNAs) as compared to ctDNA. The released ctDNA has a low half-life and decreased 
sensitivity due to large amounts of nucleic acid in serum. This review intends 
to highlight different cancer screening tests with a particular focus on the 
details regarding the only FDA-approved and awaiting technologies for FDA 
clearance to isolate CTCs and EVs based on microfluidics systems."
490,"PURPOSE: The most appropriate criteria and timing for palliative care referral 
remain a critical issue, especially in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
for whom long-term chemosensibility and survival are observed. We aimed to 
compare the impact of early palliative care including formal concertation with 
oncologists on decision for an additional line of chemotherapy compared with 
usual oncology care.
METHODS: This randomized prospective study enrolled adult women with metastatic 
breast cancer and visceral metastases with a 3rd- or 4th-line chemotherapy (CT). 
Patients received usual oncology care with a palliative care consultation only 
upon patient or oncologist request (standard group, S) or were referred to 
systematic palliative care consultation including a regular concertation between 
palliative care team and oncologists (early palliative care group, EPC). The 
primary endpoint was the rate of an additional CT (4th or 5th line) decision. 
Quality of life, symptoms, social support and satisfaction were self-evaluated 
at 6 and 12 months, at treatment discontinuation or 3 months after 
discontinuation.
RESULTS: From January 2009 to November 2012, two authorized cancer centers 
included 98 women (EPC: 50; S: 48). Thirty-seven (77.1%, 95%CI 62.7-88%) 
patients in the EPC group had a subsequent chemotherapy prescribed and 36 
(72.0%, 95%CI 57.5-83.8%) in the S group (p = 0.646). No differences in symptom 
control and global quality of life were observed, but less deterioration in 
physical functioning was reported in EPC (EPC: 0 [- 53-40]; S: - 6; 7 [- 60 to - 
20]; p = 0.027). Information exchange and communication were significant 
improved in EPC (exchange, EPC: - 8.3 [- 30 to + 7]; S: 0.0 [- 17 to + 23]; p = 
0.024; communication, EPC: 12.5 [- 8 to - 37]; S: 0.0 [- 21 to + 17]; p = 
0.004).
CONCLUSION: EPC in metastatic breast cancer patients did not impact the 
prescription rate of additional chemotherapy in patients a 3rd- or 4th-line 
chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer; however, EPC may contribute to 
alleviate deterioration in physical functioning, while facilitating 
communication.

491,"PURPOSE: After breast cancer treatment, women with breast cancer may experience 
distress caused by treatment side effects, both in physical and psychological 
aspects. Technology use is increasing in favor among women. Therefore, it is 
essential to update the scientific evidence regarding mobile and web apps' 
effectiveness in managing the side effects of breast cancer treatments for 
breast cancer survivors. The purpose of this systematic review was to 
investigate the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of mobile and web apps 
in managing the side effects of breast cancer treatments among this group.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted using ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed, 
CINAHL, and Cochrane. Published papers in English focused on mobile and web apps 
and the side effects of breast cancer treatment in breast cancer survivors were 
selected. The search reviewed studies from January 2011 to December 2021. From a 
total of 925 retrieved manuscripts, 11 studies were included for analysis.
RESULTS: The findings showed that mobile apps were more frequently used and more 
likely to be an effective method for managing the side effects of breast cancer 
treatment among breast cancer survivors. The content in web or mobile apps for 
breast cancer survivors should include five categories: (1) information about 
cancer, (2) overview of cancer care, (3) opportunities for interaction with 
other people, (4) symptom management strategies, and (5) feedback about cancer 
treatment side effect management. However, a few studies examined the effects of 
a combination of mobile and web apps in managing breast cancer treatment side 
effects. Therefore, future research is needed to examine solo and combination 
use. In addition, more rigorous studies are warranted to examine these 
interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Nurses may refer survivors to these resources to obtain more 
information and effectively manage the signs and symptoms of breast cancer and 
its treatment side effects."
492,"PURPOSE: Existing biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting metastasis of lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) may not meet the demands of clinical practice. Risk 
prediction models with multiple markers may provide better prognostic factors 
for accurate diagnosis and prediction of metastatic LUAD.
METHODS: An animal model of LUAD metastasis was constructed using CRISPR 
technology, and genes related to LUAD metastasis were screened by mRNA 
sequencing of normal and metastatic tissues. The immune characteristics of 
different subtypes were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were 
subjected to survival and Cox regression analyses to identify the specific genes 
involved in metastasis for constructing a prediction model. The biological 
function of RFLNA was verified by analyzing CCK-8, migration, invasion, and 
apoptosis in LUAD cell lines.
RESULTS: We identified 108 differentially expressed genes related to metastasis 
and classified LUAD samples into two subtypes according to gene expression. 
Subsequently, a prediction model composed of eight metastasis-related genes 
(RHOBTB2, KIAA1524, CENPW, DEPDC1, RFLNA, COL7A1, MMP12, and HOXB9) was 
constructed. The areas under the curves of the logistic regression and neural 
network were 0.946 and 0.856, respectively. The model effectively classified 
patients into low- and high-risk groups. The low-risk group had a better 
prognosis in both the training and test cohorts, indicating that the prediction 
model had good diagnostic and predictive power. Upregulation of RFLNA 
successfully promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and attenuated 
apoptosis, suggesting that RFLNA plays a role in promoting LUAD development and 
metastasis.
CONCLUSION: The model has important diagnostic and prognostic value for 
metastatic LUAD and may be useful in clinical applications."
493,"PURPOSE: Under the umbrella of social cognitive theory, we examined the 
influences of personal, environmental, and behavioral factors on adherence to 
healthy eating behaviors among colorectal cancer survivors.
METHODS: Based on Pluye and Hong's framework, a systematic mixed studies review 
was conducted. An extensive search strategy was applied in PubMed, Web of 
Science, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO (from date of record to 2022 January 22). 
The pillar integration process was employed to integrate the extracted data. The 
Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to appraise the quality of all retained 
studies.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies with a total sample size of 5106 were included in 
the analysis, with 15 quantitative studies, 12 qualitative studies, and 1 mixed 
method study. The critical appraisal showed that 22 of the 28 studies (79%) were 
rated with five stars, while 6 (21%) were rated with four stars. The personal 
factors influencing adherence to healthy eating behaviors among colorectal 
cancer survivors included outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, psychological 
factors, knowledge about healthy eating, demographic and disease 
characteristics, environmental factors incorporated outside information on 
healthy eating, power of surrounding people, social activities, cultural 
milieus, socioeconomic status, and education. The behavioral factors included 
self-regulation of diet, goals, and other behaviors closely related to healthy 
eating behaviors.
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to healthy eating behaviors among colorectal cancer 
survivors was influenced collectively by personal factors, environmental factors 
and behavioral factors."
494,"PURPOSE: The latest systematic review on the prevalence of pain in cancer 
survivors was published 5 years ago. The current review aims to provide an 
extended overview on the prevalence of pain, pain mechanisms, pain 
characteristics, and assessment methods in cancer survivors.
METHODS: A systematic research was conducted on 17th of April 2020 using 
MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane looking at studies from 
2014 to 2020. Studies had to report pain prevalence rates in cancer survivors 
with a solid tumor who finished curative treatment at least 3 months ago. 
Methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers using the 
Joanna Briggs Institute quality appraisal tool. Characteristics of the included 
studies, participants and reported pain prevalence rates were extracted. The 
reported prevalence rates of the individual studies were pooled within a 
meta-analysis. Meta-regressions were performed to identify possible determinants 
of the pooled pain prevalence.
RESULTS: After deduplication, 7300 articles were screened, after which 38 were 
included in the meta-analysis. Risk of bias was rated low in 26 articles and 
moderate in 12 articles. The pooled pain prevalence was 47% (95%CI 39-55), with 
a heterogeneity of 98.99%.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that nearly half of cancer survivors 
report pain after completing curative treatment at least 3 months ago. However, 
substantial unexplained heterogeneity warrants cautious interpretation of these 
results. Meta-regression using cancer type, treatment location, pain 
measurement, and follow-up time as a covariate could not explain influencing 
factors explaining the high heterogeneity."
495,"AIM: During choledochal cyst (CC) excision, the hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis 
(HJA) can be performed conventionally (CHJA) or with a Carrel patch (CPA). CPA 
can increase CHD diameter to 10-13 mm, preventing anastomotic stenosis and 
intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) stones but may be at risk for malignant 
transformation.
METHODS: The medical records of 83 cystic-type CC with CHD ≤ 9 mm followed up 
for at least 20 years were reviewed retrospectively. Available excised CC 
specimens (70/83) were re-examined blindly for pre-malignant changes. A 
questionnaire about suturing narrow lumens was conducted.
RESULTS: All 83 had pancreaticobiliary maljunction. Group data were similar. 
Anastomoses were CPA (n = 43) and CHJA (n = 40). Mean diameter for CPA was 
11.4 mm (range: 10-13 mm); for CHJA was 7.4 mm (range: 5-9 mm). Mean follow-up 
was 27.7 years (range: 20-42). Postoperative anastomotic stenoses were less 
after CPA: 1/43 (2.3%) versus 5/40 (12.5%) (p = 0.10), but CHJA had 
significantly more postoperative IHBD stones: 0% versus 4/40 (10.0%) (p < 0.05). 
All IHBD stone patients had anastomotic stenosis. Excised specimens showed no 
pre-malignant cytology. Lumen diameter ≤ 9 mm was considered challenging by 
10/10 surgical trainees and ≤ 7 mm by 16/22 pediatric surgeons.
CONCLUSIONS: CPA appears to be oncologically safe because of the absence of 
malignant transformation for at least 20 years."
496,"Cancer cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet increased bioenergetic 
demands. Studies in cells and mice have highlighted the importance of oxidative 
metabolism and lipogenesis in prostate cancer, however, the metabolic landscape 
of human prostate cancer remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we 
performed radiometric (14C) and stable (13C) isotope tracing assays in 
precision-cut slices of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Glucose, glutamine, 
and fatty acid oxidation was variably upregulated in malignant PDXs compared to 
benign PDXs. De novo lipogenesis (DNL) and storage of free fatty acids into 
phospholipids and triacylglycerols were increased in malignant PDXs. There was 
no difference in substrate utilization between localized and metastatic PDXs and 
hierarchical clustering revealed marked metabolic heterogeneity across all PDXs. 
Mechanistically, glucose utilization was mediated by acetyl-CoA production 
rather than carboxylation of pyruvate, while glutamine entered the TCA cycle 
through transaminase reactions before being utilized via oxidative or reductive 
pathways. Blocking fatty acid uptake or fatty acid oxidation with 
pharmacological inhibitors was sufficient to reduce cell viability in 
PDX-derived organoids (PDXOs), whereas blockade of DNL, or glucose or glutamine 
oxidation induced variable and limited therapeutic efficacy. These findings 
demonstrate that human prostate cancer, irrespective of disease stage, can 
effectively utilize all metabolic substrates, albeit with marked heterogeneity 
across tumors. We also confirm that fatty acid uptake and oxidation are 
targetable metabolic dependencies in human prostate cancer. Implications: 
Prostate cancer utilizes multiple substrates to fuel energy requirements, yet 
pharmacological targeting of fatty acid uptake and oxidation reveals metabolic 
dependencies in localised and metastatic tumors."
497,"Astatine-211 (211At) is an alpha emitter applicable to radioimmunotherapy (RIT), 
a cancer treatment that utilizes radioactive antibodies to target tumors. In the 
preparation of 211At-labeled monoclonal antibodies (211At-mAbs), the possibility 
of radionuclide-induced antibody denaturation (radiolysis) is of concern. Our 
previous study showed that this 211At-induced radiochemical reaction disrupts 
the cellular binding activity of an astatinated mAb, resulting in attenuation of 
in vivo antitumor effects, whereas sodium ascorbate (SA), a free radical 
scavenger, prevents antibody denaturation, contributing to the maintenance of 
binding and antitumor activity. However, the influence of antibody denaturation 
on the pharmacokinetics of 211At-mAbs relating to tumor accumulation, blood 
circulation time, and distribution to normal organs remains unclear. In this 
study, we use a radioactive anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(anti-HER2) mAb to demonstrate that an 211At-induced radiochemical reaction 
disrupts active targeting via an antigen-antibody interaction, whereas SA helps 
to maintain targeting. In contrast, there was no difference in blood circulation 
time as well as distribution to normal organs between the stabilized and 
denatured immunoconjugates, indicating that antibody denaturation may not affect 
tumor accumulation via passive targeting based on the enhanced permeability and 
retention effect. In a high-HER2-expressing xenograft model treated with 1 MBq 
of 211At-anti-HER2 mAbs, SA-dependent maintenance of active targeting 
contributed to a significantly better response. In treatment with 0.5 or 0.2 
MBq, the stabilized radioactive mAb significantly reduced tumor growth compared 
to the denatured immunoconjugate. Additionally, through a comparison between a 
stabilized 211At-anti-HER2 mAb and radioactive nontargeted control mAb, we 
demonstrate that active targeting significantly enhances tumor accumulation of 
radioactivity and in vivo antitumor effect. In RIT with 211At, active targeting 
contributes to efficient tumor accumulation of radioactivity, resulting in a 
potent antitumor effect. SA-dependent protection that successfully maintains 
tumor targeting will facilitate the clinical application of alpha-RIT."
498,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment of melanoma. 
However, the majority of patients have primary or acquired resistance to ICIs, 
limiting durable responses and patient survival. Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) 
signaling and the expression of IFNγ-stimulated genes correlate with either 
response or resistance to ICIs, in a context-dependent manner. While 
IFNγ-inducible immunostimulatory genes are required for response to ICIs, 
chronic IFNγ signaling induces the expression of immunosuppressive genes, 
promoting resistance to these therapies. Here, we show that high levels of ULK1 
correlate with poor survival in melanoma patients and overexpression of ULK1 in 
melanoma cells enhances IFNγ-induced expression of immunosuppressive genes, with 
minimal effects on the expression of immunostimulatory genes. In contrast, 
genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 reduces expression of IFNγ-induced 
immunosuppressive genes. ULK1 binds IRF1 in the nuclear compartment of melanoma 
cells, controlling its binding to the PD-L1 promoter region. Additionally, 
pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy further 
reduces melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Our data suggest that targeting ULK1 
represses IFNγ-dependent immunosuppression. These findings support the 
combination of ULK1 drug-targeted inhibition with ICIs for the treatment of 
melanoma patients to improve response rates and patient outcomes. Implications: 
This study identifies ULK1, activated downstream of IFNγ signaling, as a 
druggable target to overcome resistance mechanisms to ICI therapy in metastatic 
melanoma."
499,"System paclitaxel-based chemotherapy is the first-line treatment regimen of 
defense against breast cancer, but inherent or acquired chemotherapy resistance 
remains a major obstacle in breast cancer therapy. Elucidating the molecular 
mechanism of chemoresistance is essential to improve the outcome of patients 
with breast cancer. Here, we demonstrate that IFT20 is positively associated 
with shorter relapse-free survival in patients with system paclitaxel-based 
chemotherapy. High-expressed IFT20 in breast cancer cells increases resistance 
to cell death upon paclitaxel treatment; in contrast, IFT20 knockdown enhances 
apoptosis in breast cancer cells in response to paclitaxel. Mechanistically, 
IFT20 triggers β-arrestin-1 to bind with ASK1 and promotes the ubiquitination of 
ASK1 degradation, leading to attenuating ASK1 signaling and its downstream JNK 
cascades, which helps cells to escape from cell death during paclitaxel 
treatment. Our results reveal that IFT20 drives paclitaxel resistance through 
modulating ASK1 signaling and identifies IFT20 as a potential molecular 
biomarker for predicting the response to paclitaxel therapeutic in breast 
cancer. Implications: IFT20 drives paclitaxel resistance through modulating ASK1 
signaling and IFT20 may act as a potential molecular biomarker for predicting 
the response to paclitaxel therapeutic in breast cancer."
500,"PURPOSE: Meaning-making is fundamental to the cancer experience and 
communication within cancer care is saturated with metaphors. The objective of 
this study was to better understand the impact and function of war metaphors 
among patients with cancer.
METHODS: Patients at the Duke Cancer Center were purposively sampled for 
inclusion based on type and stage of their cancer. Each patient underwent a 
semi-structured interview to explore their use of metaphors in their lived 
experience with cancer. Qualitative interviews broadly explored two key areas of 
interest: (1) frequency and use of metaphors to describe cancer diagnosis, 
treatment, or survivorship; (2) function and impact of the war metaphor on the 
patient experience of cancer.
RESULTS: Fifteen participants with either breast, lung, or colorectal cancer 
were interviewed. Most patients used metaphor themes of journey, war, and 
mystery to describe their cancer. All patients with non-metastatic disease used 
war metaphors and described how these metaphors facilitated meaning-making by 
promoting positivity and situating cancer within a larger life story. The few 
patients who did not use war metaphors had metastatic disease, and they 
explained that war metaphors were unhelpful due to feeling a lack of control 
over their metastatic disease and outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The war metaphor should remain an integral part of cancer care. 
Disregarding war metaphors robs patients of an important framework for 
meaning-making-one that may promote strength, continuity, and resilience in 
navigating cancer."
501,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated diagnostic yield of small volume biopsies 
(SVB) for the diagnosis and management of follicular lymphoma (FL).
METHODS: The authors performed a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of 
SVBs including fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and needle core biopsy (NCB) for 
initial FL diagnosis and suspected recurrence or transformation of FL. A total 
of 676 workups beginning with SVB were assessed for the mean number of biopsies 
per workup, the proportion of workups requiring multiple biopsies, and the 
proportion with a complete diagnosis including grade, on initial biopsy.
RESULTS: Compared to workups performed for question transformation/recurrence, 
those done for initial FL diagnosis were significantly more likely to require 
multiple biopsies (p < .01), had a higher mean number of biopsies per workup 
(1.7 vs. 1.1, absolute standardized difference = 1.1), and a lower complete 
diagnosis rate at initial biopsy (39% vs. 56%). At initial FL diagnosis, NCB +/- 
FNA was associated with fewer biopsies per workup compared to FNA +/- CB (1.2 
vs. 1.9), fewer workups requiring multiple biopsies (23% vs. 83%), and a higher 
complete diagnosis rate (71% vs. 18%). In contrast, during assessment for 
transformation/recurrence, NCB and FNA showed a similar mean number of biopsies 
per workup (1.2 vs. 1.2) and few workups required multiple biopsies (6% vs. 
19%).
CONCLUSIONS: SVB at initial FL diagnosis often required additional biopsies to 
establish a complete diagnosis. In contrast, when assessing for 
transformed/recurrent FL, additional biopsies were generally not obtained 
regardless of SVB type, suggesting that in these clinical settings SVB may be 
sufficient for clinical decision-making."
502,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most prevalent cell types 
within the tumor microenvironment (TME). While several physicochemical cues from 
the TME, including growth factors, cytokines, and ECM specificity, have been 
identified as essential factors for CAF activation, the precise mechanism of how 
the ECM architecture regulates CAF initiation remains elusive. Using a 
gelatin-based electrospun fiber mesh, we examined the effect of matrix fiber 
density on CAF activation induced by MCF-7 conditioned media (CM). A less dense 
(3D) gelatin mesh matrix facilitated better activation of dermal fibroblasts 
into a CAF-like phenotype in the CM than a highly dense (3D) gelatin mesh 
matrix. In addition, it was discovered that CAF activation on the less dense 
(LD) matrix is dependent on the cell size-related AKT/mTOR signaling cascade, 
accompanied by an increase in intracellular tension within the well-spread 
fibroblasts."
503,"PURPOSE: Clinical trials have demonstrated higher complete response (CR) rates 
in the immuno-oncology (IO)-based combination arms than in the tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (TKI) arms in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). We 
aimed to characterize real-world patients who experienced CR to the contemporary 
first-line therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the International mRCC Database Consortium (IMDC), 
response-evaluable patients who received frontline IO-based combination therapy 
or TKI monotherapy were analyzed. Baseline characteristics of patients and 
post-landmark overall survival (OS) were compared based on best overall 
response, as per RECIST 1.1.
RESULTS: A total of 52 (4.6%) of 1126 and 223 (3.0%) of 7557 patients 
experienced CR to IO-based and TKI therapies, respectively (P=.005). An adjusted 
odds ratio for CR achieved by IO-based combination therapy (versus TKI 
monotherapy) was 1.56 (95% CI 1.11-2.17; P=.009). Among patients who experienced 
CR, the IO-based cohort had a higher proportion of non-clear cell histology 
(15.9% and 4.7%; P=.016), sarcomatoid dedifferentiation (29.8% and 13.5%; 
P=.014), and multiple sites of metastases (80.4% and 50.0%; P<.001) than the TKI 
cohort. CR was independently associated with post-landmark OS benefit in both 
the IO-based and TKI cohorts, giving respective adjusted hazard ratios of 0.17 
(95% CI 0.04-0.72; P=.016) and 0.28 (95% CI 0.21-0.38; P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The CR rate was not as high in the real-world population as in the 
clinical trial population. Among those who experienced CR, several adverse 
clinicopathological features were more frequently observed in the IO-based 
cohort than in the TKI cohort. CR was an indicator of favourable OS."
504,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality. 
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is the first choice for treatment of CRC, but it cannot 
avoid the negative effects from local high glucose (Glu) in tumor. Recently, 
5-FU therapy has been combined with other treatment modalities for CRC 
synergistic therapy. Although these combination therapy strategies are more 
effective in cancer therapy, the toxicity side effects to the liver and cause 
metabolic acidosis still exist. Herein, we report an emerging amorphous 
honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped carbon (N/C) nanozyme with nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase and catalase (CAT) activity and cascade it with 
natural glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) to realize NAD+ regeneration and further 
hyperglycemia management. In this case, by the coupling of N/C nanozyme with 
natural GDH to form a N/C-GDH system, the electron transfer route can switch 
from Glu to a common but limited electron receptor, i.e., NAD+ to ubiquitous 
large amounts of oxygen, achieving the purpose of sustainable consumption of Glu 
under NAD+ circulation and regeneration, and importantly escaping the generation 
of toxic H2O2. The combination of the N/C-GDH system and 5-FU on CRC cells was 
investigated to assess their synergistic bioeffects. Notably, our results showed 
that the N/C-GDH system and 5-FU in combination significantly suppress the 
proliferation of human colon cancer cells (HCT-116) by reducing the sugar level 
and induced apoptosis compared with either material or drug used alone. This 
work expands the nanozymes in blood Glu management as well as the promising 
cancer cell inhibition and provides the possibility of nonmetallic nanomaterials 
in the realization of effective treatment of cancer."
505,"The homeostatic control of their environment is an essential task of living 
cells. It has been hypothesized that, when microenvironmental pH inhomogeneities 
are induced by high cellular metabolic activity, diffusing protons act as 
signaling molecules, driving the establishment of exchange networks sustained by 
the cell-to-cell shuttling of overflow products such as lactate. Despite their 
fundamental role, the extent and dynamics of such networks is largely unknown 
due to the lack of methods in single-cell flux analysis. In this study, we 
provide direct experimental characterization of such exchange networks. We 
devise a method to quantify single-cell fermentation fluxes over time by 
integrating high-resolution pH microenvironment sensing via ratiometric 
nanofibers with constraint-based inverse modeling. We apply our method to cell 
cultures with mixed populations of cancer cells and fibroblasts. We find that 
the proton trafficking underlying bulk acidification is strongly heterogeneous, 
with maximal single-cell fluxes exceeding typical values by up to 3 orders of 
magnitude. In addition, a crossover in time from a networked phase sustained by 
densely connected ""hubs"" (corresponding to cells with high activity) to a sparse 
phase dominated by isolated dipolar motifs (i.e., by pairwise cell-to-cell 
exchanges) is uncovered, which parallels the time course of bulk acidification. 
Our method addresses issues ranging from the homeostatic function of proton 
exchange to the metabolic coupling of cells with different energetic demands, 
allowing for real-time noninvasive single-cell metabolic flux analysis."
506,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) seriously threatens human health and generally 
results from dysfunction of relevant module molecules, which dynamically change 
with time and conditions, rather than that of an individual molecule. In this 
study, a novel network construction algorithm for identifying early warning 
network signals (IEWNS) is proposed for improving the performance of LUAD early 
diagnosis. To this end, we theoretically derived a dynamic criterion, namely, 
the relationship of variation (RV), to construct dynamic networks. RV infers 
correlation [Formula: see text] statistics to measure dynamic changes in 
molecular relationships during the process of disease development. Based on the 
dynamic networks constructed by IEWNS, network warning signals used to represent 
the occurrence of LUAD deterioration can be defined without human intervention. 
IEWNS was employed to perform a comprehensive analysis of gene expression 
profiles of LUAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The experimental results suggest that the 
potential biomarkers selected by IEWNS can facilitate a better understanding of 
pathogenetic mechanisms and help to achieve effective early diagnosis of LUAD. 
In conclusion, IEWNS provides novel insight into the initiation and progression 
of LUAD and helps to define prospective biomarkers for assessing disease 
deterioration."
507,"Cancer screening is invaluable for early detection of disease, including for 
breast and lung cancer. Through early detection, cancer treatment can be 
commenced prior to the development of advanced stage disease, significantly 
reducing morbidity and mortality. However, eligible patients may face barriers 
when accessing screening services, and some groups may be more 
disproportionately affected than others. This review aims to describe some of 
the most prominent barriers that at-risk populations may face when accessing 
image-based cancer screening services in Canada. Characterizing these barriers 
would be helpful in determining the best strategies to increase uptake to these 
screening services and, consequently, improve health equity."
508,"BACKGROUND: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a cutaneous tumor with a high 
tendency to metastasize, and a significant proportion of patients have 
metastases at first presentation. This study aims to determine the value of 
baseline ultrasound (US) and 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission 
tomography/computed tomography (18 FDG-PET/CT) imaging in both patients with 
clinically localized MCC (Stage I/II) and patients who present with palpable 
lymph nodes (Stage III).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort included 135 MCC patients who underwent 
baseline US (with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)) and/or FDG-PET/CT 
imaging between 2015 and 2021.
RESULTS: Of the 104 patients with clinically localized disease, 48% were 
upstaged to Stage III and 3% to Stage IV by imaging or sentinel lymph node 
biopsy (SLNB). FDG-PET/CT imaging identified regional metastases in 23%, while 
US with FNAC identified regional metastases in 19%. SLNB was performed in 56 
patients, of whom 57% were upstaged to Stage III. Of the 31 patients who 
presented with palpable lymph nodes, 16% were upstaged to Stage IV by FDG-PET/CT 
imaging.
CONCLUSION: Baseline imaging frequently upstages Stage I/II MCC patients to 
Stage III, both by US and FDG-PET/CT, Stage IV disease is rarely identified. 
Patients who present with palpable nodes are frequently upstaged to Stage IV by 
FDG-PET/CT imaging."
509,"This study aimed to assess feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an 8-week 
Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) group program to treat Sexual

of 8 group sessions. Feedback indicated the program was relevant and valuable; 
minor modifications were suggested to further address survivorship concerns. 
Results of pre-post questionnaires demonstrated significant improvements in 
sexual distress and sexual interest/desire, with large effect sizes. Results

510,"Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female reproductive 
system diagnosed in the United States. The most commonly cited cause is 
unopposed endogenous estrogen produced by excess adipose tissue. Endometrial 
cancer typically is diagnosed in postmenopausal women with a body mass index 
(BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or more. This article reviews how clinicians can use a 
systematic approach to fill the awkward silence when talking with patients about 
weight. Meaningful conversations about weight loss can be achieved using the 5 
A's for obesity management with the goal of decreasing diagnosis and increasing 
survivorship from endometrial cancer."
511,"This article reviews the evidence supporting low-dose CT to screen for lung 
cancer, and the risks, costs, and challenges of implementing broad-based 
screening for eligible patients. Increased familiarity with lung cancer

opportunity to improve lung cancer screening rates and to save lives from the 
most common cause of cancer death in the United States."
512,"Nanotechnology-based drug-free therapeutic systems utilizing external stimuli 
can avoid the inherent side effects of drugs and become an attractive 
therapeutic strategy. However, the cellular stress responses (CSR) are activated 
encounter with external stimuli, which greatly weaken the efficacy of the 
drug-free antitumor. Thus, we proposed a CSR regulation strategy and synthesized 
the glucose oxidase (GOx)-modified Cu3 BiS3 nanosheets (CBSG NSs) encapsulated 
by calcium carbonate (CBSG@CaCO3 ) as the novel drug-free nanoagent. The 
CBSG@CaCO3 not only cause external stimuli such as energy consumption and 
oxidative stress damage, but also can destroy the CSR mechanism to guarantee 
optimal efficacy of starvation-chemodynamic therapy. In tumor cells, the CaCO3 
shell layer of CBSG@CaCO3 is rapidly degraded, releasing the slowly degradable 
CBSG NSs with NIR-II photothermal propertie that accelerated the production of 
external stimuli under laser irradiation. Meanwhile, CaCO3 can block CSR to 
disrupt the adaptive viability of cancer cells by inhibiting expresstion of P27 
and NRF2. Importantly, the CSR regulation achieves selective treatment on tumor 
cells based on the difference in physiological conditions between cancer cells 
and normal cells. This drug-free cancer therapy with selectivity improves the 
problem of poor efficacy under the action of CSR, which offers a new avenue in 
the cancer-related disease treatment. This article is protected by copyright.

513,"OBJECTIVE: Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are associated with serum 
lipid concentrations in the general nonpregnant population. Here, we aimed to 
establish trimester-specific reference intervals and to explore the associations 
of their variations within the specific reference intervals during pregnancy.
METHODS: Trimester-specific reference intervals were established according to 
the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute EP28-A3c guidelines using a 
direct sampling method based on a large prospective cohort. After making 
one-to-one matches, correlation analyses between TSH and lipid index levels, 
especially within the reference intervals, were conducted.
RESULT: A total of 1648 pregnant women for TSH and 2045 subjects for lipids were 
recruited to establish the trimester-specific reference intervals. The upper 
reference limit (90% confidence interval) of TSH for pregnant women in the first 
trimester is 3.95 (3.66-4.29) mIU/L, which is very close to the default value 
(4.0 mIU/L) recommended by the American Thyroid Association in 2017. Apart from 
triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TSH levels were 
positively associated with the serum concentrations of total cholesterol, 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(non-HDL-C), and remnant cholesterol (RC) either in the entire range or within 
the specific reference intervals. Of note, the positive correlations between TSH 
and non-HDL-C and RC were, albeit similarly weak (r < 0.25), relatively more 
robust (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: In this study, we showed positive correlations between TSH and lipid 
components within trimester-specific reference intervals, highlighting the need 
for the integrated management of pregnant women over age 35 and with nonoptimal 
lipid status in China."
514,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent work identified anti-GM2 and anti-GalNAc-GD1a IgG 
ganglioside antibodies as biomarkers in dogs clinically diagnosed with acute 
canine polyradiculoneuritis, in turn considered a canine equivalent of 
Guillain-Barré syndrome. This study aims to investigate the serum prevalence of 
similar antibodies in cats clinically diagnosed with immune-mediated 
polyneuropathies.
METHODS: The sera from 41 cats clinically diagnosed with immune-mediated 
polyneuropathies (IPN), 9 cats with other neurological or neuromuscular 
disorders (ONM) and 46 neurologically normal cats (CTRL) were examined for the 
presence of IgG antibodies against glycolipids GM1, GM2, GD1a, GD1b, 
GalNAc-GD1a, GA1, SGPG, LM1, galactocerebroside and sulphatide.
RESULTS: A total of 29/41 IPN-cats had either anti-GM2 or anti-GalNAc-GD1a IgG 
antibodies, with 24/29 cats having both. Direct comparison of anti-GM2 
(sensitivity: 70.7%; specificity: 78.2%) and anti-GalNAc-GD1a (sensitivity: 
70.7%; specificity: 70.9%) antibodies narrowly showed anti-GM2 IgG antibodies to 
be the better marker for identifying IPN-cats when compared to the combined ONM 
and CTRL groups (p=0.049). Anti-GA1 and/or anti-sulphatide IgG antibodies were 
ubiquitously present across all sample groups, whereas antibodies against GM1, 
GD1a, GD1b, SGPG, LM1 and galactocerebroside were overall only rarely observed.
INTERPRETATION: Anti-GM2 and anti-GalNAc-GD1a IgG antibodies may serve as serum 
biomarkers for immune-mediated polyneuropathies in cats, as previously observed 
in dogs and humans. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
515,"BACKGROUND: The adherence to a narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) treatment plan 
is derived, in large part, from the patient's skin tolerance to the phototherapy 
dose. At present, the initial and first-month incremental phototherapy doses are 
determined prior to treatment initiation based on the patient's Fitzpatrick skin 
phototyping.
OBJECTIVES: To identify variables that predict adherence to NB-UVB first-month 
treatment dosage plan.
METHODS: Charts of 1000 consecutive patients receiving NB-UVB at a 
hospital-based phototherapy unit were retrospectively analyzed. We included 
patients receiving NB-UVB for atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, vitiligo, and 
mycosis fungoides. The first-month NB-UVB treatment plan was determined based on 
the patient's Fitzpatrick phototype. Adherence to treatment was defined as 
receiving at least 80% of the planned first-month cumulative dose. We compared 
adherent vs. non-adherent patient groups for age, sex, Fitzpatrick phototype, 
presence of freckles, nevus count category, and type of dermatological disease.
RESULTS: The study included 817 eligible patients, mean age 40 (2-95) years; 54% 
men; 32% had Fitzpatrick phototype I-II. Distribution by diagnosis was atopic 
dermatitis (29%), psoriasis (27%), vitiligo (23%), and mycosis fungoides (21%). 
Adherence to NB-UVB treatment plan was observed in 71% of patients. Adherence 
decreased with age, with 7% decrease per year (P = 0.03) and was higher among 
mycosis fungoides patients (77.3%) compared to all other diagnoses (69.8%; P = 
0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to NB-UVB treatment may be related to age and diagnosis. 
Fitzpatrick phototype-based first-month treatment plans should be modified 
accordingly."
516,"OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive data synthesis of the clinical parameters that affect 
plasma EGFR mutation test results in non-small cell lung carcinoma is lacking. 
Although individual studies have suggested a variety of patient characteristics 
that can affect diagnostic accuracy, no unified conclusion has been reached.
METHODS: We analyzed 170 plasma EGFR mutation tests performed between 2015 and 
2021 at our institution and carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to 
identify clinical and imaging features that correlate with plasma EGFR mutation 
test sensitivity.
RESULTS: Data synthesis from 14 studies of 2,576 patients revealed that patients 
with stage IV disease had a significantly lower false-negative rate than those 
with stage I through III disease. For our institutional cohort, which consisted 
of 75 paired plasma and tissue tests that were assessable for diagnostic 
accuracy, the overall sensitivity was 70.59% (95% confidence interval, 
56.17%-82.51%). Patients who had distant metastases and more suspicious lymph 
nodes on imaging findings correlated with a low false-negative rate.
CONCLUSIONS: While interpreting plasma EGFR mutation results, extra caution 
should be exercised for patients with early-stage, localized disease to 
accommodate the possibility of false-negative results. These meta-analyses and 
clinical data may enable clinicians to make evidence-based judgments for 
individual patients."
517,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore how women experienced sexuality 
after radical cystectomy due to bladder cancer.
METHODS: We performed an interview study with qualitative design with content 
analysis. Inclusion criteria were age below 75 years. In total 10 women, with a 
median age of 64 years at surgery, were interviewed at median 24 months post 
radical cystectomy.
RESULTS: The 10 women described sexual life as affected after surgery but they 
all tried to find ways to overcome the new situation together with their 
partner. The overall theme was 'A balance between emotional and physical 
closeness' emerged from 30 codes that were condensed into five subcategories and 
two categories: 'A sensual relationship' and 'A sexual relationship'. The first 
category constituted the subcategories 'Feeling of intimacy' and 'The importance 
of the relationship'. The category 'A sexual relationship' was revealed from the 
subcategories 'Reluctance to engage in sexual activity' and 'Partner inability 
to engage in sexual activity', and 'Acting for sexual rehabilitation'.
CONCLUSIONS: The uncertainty that the women felt about their anatomical changes 
after radical cystectomy created a sexual anxiety and reluctance to resume 
intercourse. Even though the surgery had a major impact on their sexual life, 
the women tried to be sexually active. However, the meaning of sexual life was 
not just having sexual activity but also included closeness, affirmation, 
affection, and feeling attractive. Sexual counseling at an appropriate timepoint 
is essential to assure a balance between emotional and physical closeness, i.e. 
to regain sexual health."
518,"(1) Background: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a blood dyscrasia that 
accounts for about 20% of all leukemia cases. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
are used as first line treatment of CML. The 2019 SARS-CoV-2 outbreak raised new 
concerns for CML patients, such as whether CML increases the risk of contracting 
COVID-19, whether TKIs increase that risk, whether these drugs are safe to use 
during the infection, and whether any other hematologic parameters influence 
infection outcomes. (2) Methods: In our study we addressed these intriguing 
questions by using a retrospective analysis of 51 CML patients treated at the 
Ion Chiricuta Cancer Center, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Furthermore, we investigated 
the effects of currently approved COVID-19 vaccines in our CML patients treated 
with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. (3) Results: Our results have shown that 
hemoglobin level upon diagnosis of CML has been the only hematologic parameter 
correlated to the risk of contracting COVID-19 in our CML patients. (4) 
Conclusions: TKI treatment did not negatively influence COVID-19 risk or the 
response to the vaccine in our patients. The safety profile of the currently 
approved COVID-19 vaccines was similar to that of the general population."
519,"Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as an appealing source for 
surrogates to evaluate the disease status. Herein, we present a novel proteomic 
strategy to identify proteins and phosphoproteins from salivary EVs to 
distinguish oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients from healthy 
individuals and explore the feasibility to evaluate therapeutical outcomes. 
Bi-functionalized magnetic beads (BiMBs) with Ti (IV) ions and a lipid analog, 
1,2-Distearoyl-3-sn-glycerophosphoethanolamine (DSPE) are developed to 
efficiently isolate EVs from small volume of saliva. In the discovery stage, 
label-free proteomics and phosphoproteomics quantification showed 315 
upregulated proteins and 132 upregulated phosphoproteins in OSCC patients among 
more than 2,500 EV proteins and 1,000 EV phosphoproteins, respectively. We 
further applied targeted proteomics by coupling parallel reaction monitoring 
with parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (prm-PASEF) to measure panels of 
proteins and phosphoproteins from salivary EVs collected before and after 
surgical resection. A panel of 3 total proteins and 3 phosphoproteins, most of 
which have previously been associated with OSCC and other cancer types, show 
sensitive response to the therapy in individual patients. Our study presents a 
novel strategy to the discovery of effective biomarkers for non-invasive 
assessment of OSCC surgical outcomes with small amount of saliva. Significance 
Statement We reported here the first time to large-scale profile proteins and 
phosphoproteins in saliva extracellular vesicles (EVs) and demonstrate the 
feasibility of monitoring EV phosphoproteins to assess therapeutic outcomes with 
small amount of saliva. Salivary EVs were isolated by a novel bi-functionalized 
magnetic beads (BiMBs) with high efficiency and specificity, facilitating 
downstream proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses and longitudinal measurement 
of individual patients before and after oral surgery. This article is protected

520,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most devastating brain tumor and highly resistant to 
conventional chemotherapy. Herein, we introduce biomimetic nanosonosensitizer 
systems (MDNPs) combined with noninvasive ultrasound (US) actuation for 
orthotopic GBM-targeted delivery and sonodynamic-enhanced chemotherapy. MDNPs 
were fabricated with biodegradable and pH-sensitive polyglutamic acid (PGA) and 
the chemotherapeutic agent and sonosensitizer doxorubicin (DOX), camouflaged 
with human GBM U87 cell membranes. MDNPs presented homologous targeting 
accumulation and in vivo long-term circulation ability. They effectively passed 
through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under US assistance and reached the 
orthotopic GBM site. MDNPs exhibited controllable US-elicited sonodynamic effect 
by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS not only induced cancer cell 
apoptosis but also downregulated drug-resistance-related factors to disrupt 
chemoresistance and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy. The in vivo study of 
orthotopic GBM treatments further proved that MDNPs exhibited US-augmented 
synergistic antitumor efficacy and strongly prolonged the survival rate of mice. 
The use of low-dose DOX and the safety of US enabled repeated treatment (4 
times) without obvious cardiotoxicity. This effective and safe US-enhanced 
chemotherapy strategy with the advantages of noninvasive brain delivery and high 
drug sensitivity holds great promise for deep-seated and drug-resistant tumors."
521,"The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of Human Papillomavirus 
(HPV) genotypes in wastewater of Salto city, Uruguay, in order to obtain a 
general overview of the circulating genotypes in their population. HPV was 
detected in 34% (32/93) of the wastewater samples collected and analyzed during 
2020/21 in Salto city, Uruguay. Thirty-three genotypes were observed, of which 
16 presented read abundance higher than 1%, including both high-risk (HR) and 
low-risk (LR) genotypes. HR genotypes 31, 16, 58, 52, 33 and 59 were detected 
representing 40% (163,220 reads) of the total read abundance, with genotypes 31 
(64,365), 16 (39,337) and 58 (36,332) being the most abundant. LR genotypes 72, 
6, 11 and 40 were also detected in a high frequency, accounting for 37% 
(148,359) of the HPV reads. This study highlights the high frequency of HR 
genotypes of HPV, circulating in the population of Salto city which is a burden 
in public health mainly due to the devastating impact of cervical cancer in 
women."
522,"Cancer is the most prevalent disease of concern worldwide for several decades. 
Diverse therapeutic aspects are in applications to control this phenomenal 
disease and also for decennaries. Among many causes and consequences of cancer, 
senescence has gained much interest in recent times. Senescence, also termed 
aging, is the natural process that induces cancer in neighbouring cells through 
Senescence-Associated-Secretory Phenotypes (SASPs) production. As a cure or 
preventive measure of cancer progression, studies already light upon multiple 
proteins and their roles in associated pathways but the aspect of different 
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is emerging recently and is under extensive research. 
Different approaches toward controlling senescence and inhibiting senescent cell 
accumulation are other aspects of cancer procurement. Thus, the role of ncRNA 
molecules in senescence and aging is getting much more interest as an alternate 
therapy for cancer treatment. In this review, at first, the roles of different 
ncRNAs related to several cellular processes are described. Then we tried to 
highlight the roles of different non-coding RNAs in senescence-induced cancer 
formation that extends with increasing age and emphasized non-coding RNAs as a 
therapeutic target solely or in combination with small molecules where drugging 
of small molecules targeting these non-coding RNAs can control cancer 
development."
523,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare current treatment response rates with 
personalized Total Neoadjuvant Therapy (pTNT), against extended chemotherapy in 
the 'wait period' (xCRT) and standard chemoradiotherapy (sCRT) with adjuvant 
chemotherapy for rectal cancer.
METHODS: This was a multicentre retrospective cohort analysis. Consecutive 
patients with rectal cancer treated with pTNT over a 3.9-year period were 
compared to a historical cohort of patients treated with xCRT or sCRT as part of 
the published WAIT Trial. pTNT patients received 8 cycles mFOLFOX6 or 6 cycles 
CAPOX in the neoadjuvant setting (no adjuvant treatment). Patients in the WAIT 
Trial received either 3 cycles 5-FU/LV during the 10-week wait period after 
chemoradiotherapy or standard chemoradiotherapy, followed by adjuvant 
chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall complete response (oCR) rate 
defined as the proportion of patients who achieved either complete clinical 
response (cCR) or pathological complete response (pCR).
RESULTS: Of 284 patients diagnosed with rectal cancer during the 3.9-year 
period, 107 received pTNT. Forty of these were matched with 49 patients from the 
WAIT Trial (25 received xCRT and 24 received sCRT). There was a significant 
difference in oCR between the groups (pTNT n = 21, xCRT n = 6, sCRT n = 7, 
P = 0.043). Of the patients that underwent surgery, pCR occurred in 13 patients 
with no significant difference between groups (P = 0.415). There were no 
significant differences in 2-year disease-free survival or overall survival.
CONCLUSION: Compared with sCRT and xCRT, pTNT results in a significantly higher 
complete response rate which may facilitate organ preservation."
524,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Estrogen-dependent endometrial cancer mainly occurs in 
younger pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women and threatens their health. 
Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been considered as novel targets in 
endometrial cancer treatment. Therefore, we aimed to explore the effect of miRNA 
(miR)-196a-5p in estrogen-dependent endometrial cancer.
METHODS: 17β-estradiol (E2; 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 nM) was used to treat RL95-2, 
HEC-1B and ECC-1 cells followed by cell viability assessment using 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The level of 
miR-196a-5p was measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). We 
then transfected miR-196a-5p mimic/inhibitor and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) 
small interfering RNA (siRNA) into E2-treated cells. Apoptotic cells were 
measured by flow cytometry. Wound healing and Transwell assays were implemented 
to assess migration and invasion. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays 
were applied to confirm the interaction between miR-196a-5p and FOXO1. 
Immunoblotting determined the levels of FOXO1, Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase 3.
RESULTS: E2 promoted cell viability and miR-196a-5p expression in RL95-2 and 
ECC-1 cells. miR-196a-5p mimic enhanced cell viability, migration and invasion 
but suppressed apoptosis and FOXO1, whilst miR-196a-5p inhibitor blocked these 
processes. In addition, miR-196a-5p upregulated Bcl-2, but down regulated Bax 
and Caspase 3 expression, an effect that was reversed by miR-196a-5p inhibitor. 
We determined that miR-196a-5p targeted FOXO1, and that si-FOXO1 blocked the 
effects of miR-196a-5p inhibitor on viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion 
of E2-treated RL95-2 and ECC-1 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested potential diagnostic and therapeutic 
applications for miR-196a-5p and its FOXO1 target in patients suffering from 
estrogen-dependent endometrial cancer."
525,"The Warburg effect suggests that upregulated glycolysis arising from high 
glucose uptake in cancer cells might be accompanied with suppressed 
mitochondrial respiration. However, recent studies have shown that the 
mitochondrial temperature in cancer cells could be relatively higher than that 
in normal cells, suggesting hyperactive mitochondrial respiration in cancer 
cells. However, hot mitochondria have not been reported in patients with cancer. 
Here, near-infrared small-molecule fluorescent probes TRNs are rationally 
designed with two ethyl amino groups as the temperature-sensitive moiety. 
Afterward, a mitochondrial targeting group is installed via ether bonds on TRN-8 
to build MTN. To the best of our knowledge, MTN is the near-infrared probe with 
the highest sensitivity for mitochondrial temperature. Moreover, it also 
displays high photostability, wide linearity, and high specificity. Using MTN, 
we can monitor the ups and downs of mitochondrial temperature in cancer cells 
upon the perturbations of mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, we demonstrate 
that the mitochondrial temperature in surgically resected human tumors is 
relatively higher than that in paracancerous tissues. Our results indicate that 
relatively hot mitochondria may exist in tumors from patients. We envisage that 
our study provides critical evidence for revisiting the Warburg effect and 
cancer metabolism."
526,"BACKGROUND: Studies of robotic lobectomy (Robot-L) have been performed using 
data from high-volume, specialty centers which may not be generalizable. The 
purpose of this study was to compare mortality, length of stay (LOS), and cost 
between Robot-L and thoracoscopic lobectomy (VATS-L) using a nationally 
representative database hypothesizing they would be similar.
METHODS: The Premier Healthcare Database was used to identify patients receiving 
elective lobectomy for lung cancer from 2009 to 2019. Patients were categorized 
as receiving Robot-L or VATS-L using ICD-9/10 codes. Survey methodology and 
patient level weighting were used to correct for sampling error and estimation 
of a nationally representative sample. A propensity match analysis was performed 
to reduce bias between the groups. Primary outcome of interest was in-hospital 
mortality. Secondary outcomes were LOS and patient charges.
RESULTS: Among 62 698 patients, 19 506 (31.1%) underwent Robot-L and 43 192 
(68.9%) underwent VATS-L. Differences between the groups included age, race, 
comorbidities, and insurance type. A propensity matched cohort demonstrated 
similar in-hospital mortality for Robot-L and VATS-L (.9% vs .9%, respectively, 
P = .91). Patients who underwent Robot-L had a shorter LOS (4 vs 5d, 
respectively, P < .001) but higher patient charges (90 593.0 vs 72 733.3 USD, 
respectively, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally representative database, Robot-L and VATS-L had 
similar mortality. Although Robot-L was associated with shorter hospitalization, 
it was also associated with excess charges of almost $20,000. As Robot-L is now 
the most common approach for lobectomy in the U.S., further study into the cost 
and benefit of robotic surgery is warranted."
527,"Cherenkov radiation (CR) derived from the decay of diagnostic and therapeutic 
radionuclides is currently being studied by the scientific community to 
determine if these emissions can be harnessed for cancer detection and therapy. 
While Cherenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) has been studied in the preclinical 
and clinical settings, Cherenkov radiation-induced cancer therapy (CRICT) is a 
relatively new area of research that harnesses the emitted photons to kill 
cancer cells through free radical generation and DNA damage. Nanoparticles seem 
well suited for developing a theranostic platform that would allow researchers 
to visualize therapy delivery and also generate the reactive oxygen species 
necessary to kill cancer cells. Herein, we report the preparation of an 
89Zr-TiO2-MnO2 nanocomposite that incorporates transferrin onto the nanoparticle 
surface to enhance cancer cell growth inhibition. The incorporation of the 
positron emission tomography (PET) radioisotope 89Zr (half-life: 3.3 days) 
allowed for the detection of the nanoparticle using PET and for the creation of 
Cherenkov emissions that interacted with the nanoparticle surface to generate 
free radicals for therapy delivery. After preparation, these systems were 
observed to be stable in various media and provided excellent tumor growth 
control after being intratumorally injected into mice bearing CT-26 tumors. 
These results demonstrate that a therapeutically efficient CRICT platform can be 
generated using commercially available and affordable materials."
528,"BACKGROUND: The X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is a DNA repair 
gene. Various studies have examined the association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp 
polymorphism and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) susceptibility 
with contradictory results. So, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed 
to assess whether variants of this polymorphism increase the HNSCC risk or not.
RECENT FINDINGS: Thirty three studies consisting of 14282 subjects (6012 cases 
and 8270 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Variants of XRCC1 
Arg194Trp polymorphism were associated with increased HNSCC risk and the 
associations were significant based on heterozygous and dominant models 
(heterozygous model: OR = 1.182, 95%CI = 1.015-1.377, P = 0.032; homozygous

this polymorphism and HNSCC risk based on Asian ethnicity under dominant model, 
hospital control source under different genetic models, PCR-RFLP genotyping 
method under dominant model and oral cavity tumor site under heterozygous and 
dominant models.
OBJECTIVE: The X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is a DNA repair 
gene. Various studies have examined the association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp 
polymorphism and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) susceptibility 
with contradictory results. So, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed 
to assess whether variants of this polymorphism increase the HNSCC risk or not.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literatures published till April 2022 was 
conducted using Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library 
and Embase databases. The heterogeneity was assessed with the I-Square 
statistic. A random effects model or fixed effects model was used to analyze the 
data. Data were reported by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). 
The p value was considered significant if p < .05.
RESULTS: Thirty three studies consisting of 14 282 subjects (6012 cases and 8270 
controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Variants of XRCC1 Arg194Trp 
polymorphism were associated with increased HNSCC risk and the associations were 
significant based on heterozygous and dominant models (heterozygous model: 
OR = 1.182, 95%CI = 1.015-1.377, p = .032; homozygous model: OR = 1.274, 
95%CI = 0.940-1.727, p = .119; dominant model: OR = 1.194, 95%CI = 1.027-1.388, 
p = .021; recessive model: OR = 1.181, 95%CI = 0.885-1.576, p = .119). There 
were significant associations between variants of this polymorphism and HNSCC 
risk based on Asian ethnicity under dominant model, hospital control source 
under different genetic models, PCR-RFLP genotyping method under dominant model 
and oral cavity tumor site under heterozygous and dominant models.
CONCLUSION: Variants of XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism were significantly 
associated with increased risk of HNSCC development based on heterozygous and 
dominant genetic models."
529,"The relatively quiet mutational landscape of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) suggests 
that epigenetic deregulation could be central to oncogenesis and tumour 
aggressiveness. Histone variants have long been recognised as important 
epigenetic regulators of gene expression. However, the role of histone variants 
in RMS has not been studied hitherto. In this study, we show that histone 
variant H3.3 is overexpressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), an aggressive 
subtype of RMS. Functionally, knockdown of H3F3A, which encodes for H3.3, 
significantly impairs the ability of ARMS cells to undertake migration and 
invasion and reduces Rho activation. In addition, a striking reduction in 
metastatic tumour burden and improved survival is apparent in vivo. Using 
RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing analyses, we identified Melanoma Cell 
Adhesion Molecule (MCAM/CD146) as a direct downstream target of H3.3. Loss of 
H3.3 resulted in a reduction in the presence of active marks, and an increase in 
the occupancy of H1 at the MCAM promoter. Cell migration and invasion were 
rescued in H3F3A-depleted cells through MCAM overexpression. Moreover, we 
identified G9a, a lysine methyltransferase encoded by EHMT2, as an upstream 
regulator of H3F3A. Therefore, this study identifies a novel H3.3 dependent axis 
involved in ARMS metastasis. These findings establish the potential of MCAM as a 
therapeutic target for high-risk ARMS patients. This article is protected by

530,"For stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with a high risk of recurrence, 
intensified adjuvant chemotherapy can improve overall survival. We aimed to 
develop a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation marker model for predicting 
the relapse risk of stage III CRC patients. Differentially methylated markers 
identified between 53 normal mucosa samples and 165 CRC tissue samples, as well 
as between plasma samples from 75 stage I/II (early-stage) CRC patients and 55 
stage IV (late-stage) CRC patients, were analyzed using Student's t-tests. The 
overlapping methylation markers shared by plasma and tissue samples were used to 
establish a methylation marker model to evaluate the tumor burden in the 
peripheral blood of CRC patients by using the random forest method. This model 
was verified in the validation cohort (n= 44) and then applied to predict 
recurrence risk in 50 stage III CRC patients and monitor the clinical disease 
course in serial samples from 4 CRC patients. We built a five-marker-based ctDNA 
methylation model that had high sensitivity (84.21%) and specificity (84%) in 
identifying late-stage CRC in a validation cohort containing 24 stage I/II CRC 
patients and 20 stage IV CRC patients. The model achieved high sensitivity 
(87.5%) and specificity (94.12%) in predicting tumor relapse in an independent 
cohort of 50 stage III CRC patients and could be an independent recurrence risk 
factor for stage III patients (HR, 60.4; 95% CI: 7.68-397; P = 9.73e-5). 
Analysis of serial blood samples of CRC showed that the model could monitor 
disease relapse earlier than imaging examination and serum carcinoembryonic 
antigen (CEA) and so may provide an opportunity for the early adjustment of 
therapeutic strategies. Moreover, the model could potentially monitor the 
clinical course and treatment response dynamically. This article is protected by

531,"Growing interest in i-motif DNA as a transcriptional regulatory element 
motivates development of synthetic molecules capable of targeting these 
structures. In this study, we designed unmodified peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and 
gamma-modified PNA (γPNA) oligomers complementary to an i-motif forming sequence 
derived from the promoter of the KRAS oncogene. Biophysical techniques such as 
circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, CD melting, and fluorescence spectroscopy 
demonstrated the successful invasion of the i-motif by PNA and γPNA. Both PNA 
and γPNA showed very strong binding to the target sequence with high thermal 
stability of the resulting heteroduplexes. Interestingly fluorescence and CD 
experiments indicated formation of an intermolecular i-motif structure via the 
overhangs of target-probe heteroduplexes formed by PNA/γPNA invasion of the 
intramolecular i-motif. Targeting promoter i-motif forming sequences with 
high-affinity oligonucleotide mimics like γPNAs may represent a new approach for 
inhibiting KRAS transcription, thereby representing a potentially useful 
anti-cancer strategy."
532,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common histologic diagnosis among the 
aggressive lymphomas, accounting for 30% of all lymphomas. Human herpes virus 
8-negative effusion-based lymphoma (HHV8-negative EBL) is a rare form of 
lymphoma, under recognized and still not well characterized in the literature. 
In contrast to primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), HHV8-negative EBL is 
characterized by malignant effusion in essentially serous body cavity with no 
detectable contiguous tumor masses and is no associated with human 
immunodeficiency virus and HHV8 infections. The presence of comorbid medical 
conditions can hide this type of lymphoma and made diagnosis more challenging. 
Here, we describe a rare case of an 82-year-old male suffering from peritoneal

days in Mm subjects with covid-19 treated with oral antivirals. Nirmatrelvir/r 
was prescribed in 10 subjects whereas molnupiravir in 5. Despite two 
hospitalizations were reported, we did not observe deaths due to covid-19 in

535,"OBJECTIVES: Extension of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction under 
the squamous epithelium may lead to errors when determining lateral margins. 
However, the characteristics of subsquamous extension are unclear. Herein, we 
evaluated the prevalence and characteristics of subsquamous extension of 
adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction and the diagnostic performance of 
endoscopy for this condition.
METHODS: Eighty-nine consecutive patients with superficial adenocarcinoma of the 
esophagogastric junction who underwent endoscopic or surgical resection at a 
tertiary cancer center between January 2010 and December 2017 were 
retrospectively evaluated. Endoscopic subsquamous extension was defined as a 
submucosal tumor-like elevation covered by squamous epithelium and/or a brownish 
area with abnormal microvessels on the squamous epithelium observed using 
narrow-band imaging. The diagnostic performance of endoscopy for subsquamous 
extension was evaluated using histological subsquamous extension as gold 
standard.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (44%) had histological subsquamous extension. 
Proton pump inhibitor use was significantly associated with histological 
subsquamous extension [odds ratio: 4.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.77-12.2]. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative 
predictive value and accuracy of endoscopic subsquamous extension were 56% (95% 
CI: 40-72%), 96% (86-99%), 92% (73-99%), 74% (62-84%) and 79% (69-87%), 
respectively. The median length difference between histological and endoscopic 
subsquamous extension was 2 mm (range: -6 to 9 mm).
CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of endoscopic diagnosis of subsquamous extension 
was unsatisfactory. The endoscopic length of subsquamous extension tended to be 
underestimated. An oral safety margin of one centimeter is reasonable during 
endoscopic resection of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction.IMPACT 
STATEMENT This study will contribute significantly to the literature because 
this is the first study to determine the difference between the lengths of 
subsquamous extension detected endoscopically and histologically. This study 
determines the prevalence of subsquamous extension and identifies 
characteristics associated with subsquamous extension. An understanding of the 
risk of subsquamous extension is important when choosing a treatment strategy 
and planning the resection margins in patients with adenocarcinoma of the 
esophagogastric junction. This study provides patients with subsquamous 
extension characteristics and suggests a method for accurately diagnosing this 
condition."
536,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is one of the most frequent 
dose-limiting side effects, observed in patients receiving antineoplastic 
agents, persisting for up to two years after completing treatment, greatly 
affecting both the course of chemotherapy and patients' quality of life. 
Approximately 20 to 85% of patients treated with neurotoxic chemotherapy will 
develop peripheral neuropathy and there is considerable variability in its 
severity among patients. The main symptoms are numbness, paresthesia, and 
burning pain in a ""glove and stocking"" distribution. The prevalence of 
chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy will likely increase as cancer 
survival rates continue to improve. Currently, there are only a few therapeutic 
options available for the prevention or successful therapy because the 
mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy remain unclear. A 
better understanding of the risk factors and underlying mechanisms of

537,"Cancer is one of the major contributors to human mortality and has a serious 
influence on human survival and health. In biomedical research, the 
identification of cancer driver genes (cancer drivers for short) is an important 
task; cancer drivers can promote the progression and generation of cancer. To 
identify cancer drivers, many methods have been developed. These computational 
models only identify coding cancer drivers; however, non-coding drivers likewise 
play significant roles in the progression of cancer. Hence, we propose a 
Network-based Method for identifying cancer Driver Genes based on node Control 
Centrality (NMDGCC), which can identify coding and non-coding cancer driver 
genes. The process of NMDGCC for identifying driver genes mainly includes the 
following two steps. In the first step, we construct a gene interaction network 
by using mRNAs and miRNAs expression data in the cancer state. In the second 
step, the control centrality of the node is used to identify cancer drivers in 
the constructed network. We use the breast cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) to verify the effectiveness of NMDGCC. Compared with the existing 
methods of cancer driver genes identification, NMDGCC has a better performance. 
NMDGCC also identifies 295 miRNAs as non-coding cancer drivers, of which 158 are 
related to tumorigenesis of BRCA. We also apply NMDGCC to identify driver genes 
related to the different breast cancer subtypes. The result shows that NMDGCC 
detects many cancer drivers of specific cancer subtypes."
538,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated whether patients' initial screening symptoms were 
related to subsequent utilization of supportive care services and 
hospitalizations, and whether patient-level demographics, symptoms, 
hospitalizations, and supportive care service utilization were associated with 
mortality in primarily low-income, older, Black Veterans with cancer.
METHODS: This quality improvement project created collaborative clinics to 
conduct cancer distress screenings and refer to supportive care services at an 
urban, VA medical center. All patients completed a distress screen with 
follow-up screening every 3 months. Supportive care utilization, hospitalization 
rates, and mortality were abstracted through medical records. Poisson regression 
models and cox proportional hazard models were utilized.
RESULTS: Five hundred and eighty five screened patients were older (m = 72), 
mostly Black 70% (n = 412), and had advanced cancer 54%. Fifty-eight 
percent (n = 340) were screened only once with 81% (n = 470) receiving ≥1 
supportive care service and 51.5% (n = 297) being hospitalized ≥1 time 18 months 
following initial screen. Symptom severity was significantly related to number 
of hospitalizations. Low mood was significantly related to higher supportive 
services (p < 0.001), but not hospitalizations (p ≥ 0.52). Pain, fatigue, 
physical function, nutrition, and physical symptoms were significantly 
associated with more supportive services and hospitalizations (p < 0.01). Twenty 
percent (n = 168) died; Veterans who were Black, had lower stage cancers, better 
physical health, and utilized less supportive care services had lower odds of 
mortality (p ≤ 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Individuals with elevated distress needs and those reporting lower 
physical function utilized more supportive care services and had higher 
hospitalization rates. Lower physical function, greater supportive care use, 
higher stage cancer, and being non-Black were associated with higher odds of 
death."
539,"Elevated expression of lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) contributes to the malignant 
tumor progression in multiple cancers. However, the role of LOXL2 in the 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. 
This study aimed to explore the effects of LOXL2 on 5-FU sensitivity in CRC. The 
mRNA and protein levels of LOXL2 were explored in public databases by 
bioinformatics, validated in clinical tissues using immunohistochemistry, and 
detected in 5-FU treated cell lines. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) 
values were quantified based on the cell viability at different concentrations 
of 5-FU with CCK-8 assays. Colony formation and flow cytometry assays were 
performed to measure the proliferation and apoptosis rates. Gene set enrichment 
and correlation analyses were conducted to identify the probable mechanism of 
LOXL2 in TCGA samples. Critical molecules of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and 
anti-apoptotic BCL2 in protein levels were detected with Western blotting. It 
concluded that LOXL2 was up-regulated and positively linked to the unfavorable 
prognosis of CRC patients. The LOXL2 expression increased with the rising 5-FU 
concentrations, especially at 20 and 40 μM. Elevated LOXL2 promoted the 
resistance to 5-FU, augmented the proliferation, and inhibited 5-FU-induced 
apoptosis of CRC cells. LOXL2 activated the Hedgehog signaling pathway by 
promoting the expression of SMO, GLI1, and GLI2, leading to the upregulation of 
downstream target gene BCL2 in CRC cells. Moreover, the Hedgehog signaling 
pathway inhibitor cyclopamine blocked the BCL2 upregulation mediated by LOXL2. 
This study has demonstrated that LOXL2 can reduce 5-FU sensitivity through the 
Hedgehog/BCL2 signaling pathway in CRC."
540,"OBJECTIVES: Nerve-sparing techniques during radical prostatectomy have been 
associated with an increased risk of positive surgical margins. The 
intra-operative detection of residual prostatic tissue could help mitigate this 
risk. The objectives of the present study were to assess the feasibility of 
using an anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (anti-PSMA) antibody conjugated 
with a fluorophore to characterize fresh prostate tissue as prostatic or 
non-prostatic for intra-operative surgical margin detection.
METHODS: Fresh prostatic tissue samples were collected from transurethral 
resections of the prostate (TURP) or prostate biopsies, and either 
immunolabelled with anti-PSMA antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or used 
as controls. A dedicated, laparoscopy-compliant fluorescence device was 
developed for real-time fluorescence detection. Confocal microscopy was used as 
the gold standard for comparison. Spectral unmixing was used to distinguish 
specific, Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence from nonspecific autofluorescence.
RESULTS: The average peak wavelength of the immuno-labeled TURP samples (n = 4) 
was 541.7 ± 0.9 nm and of the control samples (n = 4) was 540.8 ± 2.2 nm. 
Spectral unmixing revealed that these similar measures were explained by 
significant autofluorescence, linked to electrocautery. Three biopsy samples 
were then obtained from seven patients and also displayed significant 
nonspecific fluorescence, raising questions regarding the reproducibility of the 
fixation of the anti-PSMA antibodies on the samples. Comparing the fluorescence 
results with final pathology proved challenging due to the small sample size and 
tissue alterations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed similar fluorescence of immuno-labeled prostate 
tissue samples and controls, failing to demonstrate the feasibility of 
intra-operative margin detection using PSMA immuno-labeling, due to marked 
tissue autofluorescence. We successfully developed a fluorescence device that 
could be used intraoperatively in a laparoscopic setting. Use of the infrared 
range as well as newly available antibodies could prove interesting options for 
future research."
541,"Emergence of various circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) promotes 
the identification of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines and broadly neutralizing 
antibodies (bNAbs). Here, to characterize monoclonal antibodies cross-reactive 
against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 and to search the criterion for bNAbs 
against all emerging SARS-CoV-2, we isolated several SARS-CoV-1-cross-reactive 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from a wildtype SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donor. 
These antibodies showed broad binding capacity and cross-neutralizing potency 
against various SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 
(Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta), but failed to efficiently neutralize Omicron 
variant and its sublineages. Structural analysis revealed how Omicron 
sublineages, but not other VOCs, efficiently evade an antibody family 
cross-reactive against SARS-CoV-1 through their escape mutations. Further 
evaluation of a series of SARS-CoV-1/2-cross-reactive bNAbs showed a negative 
correlation between the neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-1 and 
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Together, these results suggest the necessity of 
using cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Omicron as criteria 
for rational design and development of potent pan-sarbecovirus vaccines and 
bNAbs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
542,"Since the report of the first COVID-19 case in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 variants of 
concern (VOCs) have continued to emerge, manifesting diverse infectivity, 
evasion of host immunity and pathology. While ACE2 is the predominant receptor 
of SARS-CoV-2, TMPRSS2, Kim-1, NRP-1, CD147, furin, CD209L and CD26 have also 
been implicated as viral entry-related cofactors. To understand the variations 
in infectivity and pathogenesis of VOCs, we conducted infection analysis in 
human cells from different organ systems using pseudoviruses of VOCs including 
Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. Recombinant spike S1, RBD, ACE2, Kim-1 and NRP-1 
proteins were tested for their ability to block infection to dissect their roles 
in SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. Compared with wild type SARS-CoV-2 (WT), 
numerous VOCs had significant increases of infectivity across a wide spectrum of 
cell types. Recombinant ACE2 protein more effectively inhibited the infection of 
VOCs including Delta and Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) than that of WT. Interestingly, 
recombinant S1, RBD, Kim-1 and NRP-1 proteins inhibited the infection of all 
pseudoviruses in a manner dependent on the levels of ACE2 expression in 
different cell types. These results provide insights into the diverse 
infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, which might be helpful for managing the 
emergence of new VOCs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

543,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major aetiology associated with the development and 
progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary liver 
malignancy. Over the past few decades, direct and indirect mechanisms have been 
identified in the pathogenesis of HBV-associated HCC which include altered 
signaling pathways, genome integration, mutation-induced genomic instability, 
chromosomal deletions and rearrangements. Intertwining of the HBV counterparts 
with the host cellular factors, though well established, needs to be systemized 
to understand the dynamics of host-HBV crosstalk and its consequences on HCC 
progression. Existence of a vast array of protein-protein and protein-nucleic 
acid interaction databases has led to the uncoiling of the compendia of 
genes/gene products associated with these interactions. This review covers the 
existing knowledge about the HBV-host interplay and brings it down under one

544,"PURPOSE: Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) are well placed to deliver physical 
activity advice but this is currently not routine clinical practice. Increasing 
evidence demonstrates physical activity can improve quality-of-life for people 
affected by cancer, enable behaviour change, improve survival and reduce 
long-term treatment effects. We aimed to understand AHPs' current knowledge and 
practice in advising about physical activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: AHPs' self-reported knowledge, competency and training 
needs in managing physical effects of cancer, and the merits of physical 
activity data were collected via an online survey. The survey link was cascaded 
electronically to all NHS and NHS-affiliated AHPs working across several generic 
and non-cancer-specific healthcare interfaces across one city in England.
RESULTS: Eighty AHPs responded. Forty-one percent of AHPs had patients with 
current or past diagnoses of cancer. Overall, AHPs reported low confidence in 
giving physical activity advice, with physiotherapists the most confident. 60% 
of respondents identified training needs concerning the impact of cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the merits of physical activity for people affected by 
cancer is clearly evidenced, low levels of AHP confidence and competence in 
discussing this topic limit patients' awareness and access to services. 
Addressing this confidence and competence has potential to improve patient 
outcome."
545,"Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the deadliest and frequently diagnosed 
metastatic cancers worldwide. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the cell population 
within the tumor niche, having an epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) transition 
phenotype, high self-renewal, vigorous metastatic capacity, drug resistance, and 
tumor relapse. Identification of targets for induction of apoptosis is essential 
to provide novel therapeutic approaches in BC. Our earlier studies showed that 
Vitamin C induces apoptotic cell death by losing redox balance in TNBC CSCs. In 
this study, we have attempted to identify previously unrecognized CSC survival 
factors that can be used as druggable targets for bCSCs apoptosis regulators 
isolated from the TNBC line, MDA MB 468. After a thorough literature review, 
Oct-4 was identified as the most promising marker for its unique abundance in 
cancer and absence in normal cells and the contribution of Oct-4 to the 
sustenance of cancer cells. We then validated a very high expression of Oct-4 in 
the MDA MB 468 bCSCs population using flow-cytometry. The loss of Oct-4 was 
carried out using small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown in the bCSCs, 
followed by assessing for cellular apoptosis. Our results indicated that Oct-4 
knockdown induced cell death, changes in cellular morphology, inhibited 
mammosphere formation, and positive for Annexin-V expression, thereby indicating 
the role of Oct-4 in bCSC survival. Moreover, our findings also suggest the 
direct interaction between Oct-4 and Vitamin C using in silico docking. This 
data, hence, contributes towards novel information about Oct-4 highlighting this 
molecule as a novel survival factor in bCSCs."
546,"Artificial enzymes have demonstrated therapeutic benefit against diverse 
malignant tumors, yet their antitumor potencies are still severely compromised 
by non-selective catalysis, low atomic utilization efficiency, and undesired 
off-target toxicity. Herein, we report that the peroxidase-like biomineralized 
copper (II) carbonate hydroxide nanocrystals inside single albumin nanocages 
(CuCH-NCs) act as a pH-activatable proenzyme to achieve tumor-selective and 
synergistic chemodynamic/chemo-immunotherapy against aggressive triple-negative 
breast cancers (TNBCs). These CuCH-NCs show pH-sensitive Cu2+ release, which 
spontaneously undergoes glutathione (GSH)-mediated reduction into Cu+ species 
for catalyzing the evolution of H2 O2 into hydroxyl radicals in a 
single-atom-like manner to cause chemodynamic cell injury, and simultaneously 
activates non-toxic disulfiram to cytotoxic complex for yielding selective 
chemotherapeutic damage via blocking cell proliferation and amplifying cell 
apoptosis. CuCH-NCs exhibit considerable tumor-targeting capacity with deep 
penetration depth, thus affording preferable efficacy against orthotopic breast 
tumors through synergistic chemodynamic/chemotherapy, together with good in vivo 
safety. Moreover, CuCH-NCs arouse distinct immunogenic cell death effect and 
upregulate PD-L1 expression upon disulfiram combination, and thus synergize with 
anti-PD-L1 antibody to activate adaptive and innate immunities, together with 
relieved immunosuppression, finally yielding potent antitumor efficacy against 
both primary and metastatic TNBCs. These results provide insights into smart and 
high-performance proenzymes for synergistic therapy against aggressive cancers.

547,"Limited studies provide direct evidence of Clonorchis sinensis adults in the 
early stage of gallbladder stone formation. Our current research systematically 
studied 33 gallbladder stones resembling adult worms and shed light on the 
definite connection of C. sinensis infection with concomitant cholelithiasis. A 
total of 33 gallbladder stones resembling adult C. sinensis worms were 
systematically analysed. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning 
electron microscopy and X-ray energy spectrometry were used to analyse the 
composition and microstructure. Meanwhile, a histopathological examination of 
the stone was carried out. The 33 gallbladder stones resembling adult C. 
sinensis worms included nine calcium carbonate (CaCO3) stones, 12 bilirubinate 
stones and 12 mixed stones. Clonorchis sinensis eggs were found in 30 cases, 
including all CaCO3 and mixed stones. Parasite tissues were detected in 12 
cases, which were mainly CaCO3 stones or bilirubinate-CaCO3 mixed stones. The 
outer layer of stones was wrapped with 12.88% calcium salt, as revealed by X-ray 
energy spectrometry, while surprisingly, many C. sinensis eggs were found in the 
inner part of these stones. Based on our current findings, we concluded that 
calcification and packaging occurred after C. sinensis adult entrance into the 
gallbladder, subsequently leading to the early formation of CaCO3 or 
bilirubinate-CaCO3 mixed gallbladder stones. This discovery highlights definite 
evidence for C. sinensis infection causing gallbladder stones."
548,"Up to 50% of patients treated with curative esophagectomy for esophageal cancer 
will develop recurrence, contributing to the dismal survival associated with 
this disease. Regional recurrence may represent disease that is not yet widely 
metastatic and may therefore be amenable to more-aggressive treatment. We sought 
to assess all patients treated with curative esophagectomy for esophageal cancer 
who developed regional recurrence. We retrospectively identified all patients 
who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal adenocarcinoma and esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma at a single institution from January 2000 to August 
2019. In total, 1626 patients were included in the study cohort. As of June 
2022, 595 patients had disease recurrence, which was distant or systemic in 435 
patients (27%), regional in 125 (7.7%), and local in 35 (2.2%). On multivariable 
analysis, neoadjuvant chemoradiation with a total radiation dose <45 Gy (hazard 
ratio [HR], 3.5 [95% CI, 1.7-7.3]; P=0.001), pathologic node-positive disease 
(HR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.3-3.0]; P=0.003), and lymphovascular invasion (HR, 1.6 [95% 
CI, 1.0-2.5]; P=0.049) were predictors of isolated nodal recurrence, whereas 
increasing age (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]; P=0.001) and increasing number of 
excised lymph nodes (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.95-1.00]; P=0.021) were independently 
associated with decreased risk of regional recurrence. Patients treated with a 
combination of local and systemic therapies had better survival outcomes than 
patients treated with systemic therapy alone (P<0.001). In patients with 
recurrence of esophageal cancer limited to regional lymph nodes, salvage 
treatment may be possible. Higher radiation doses and more-extensive 
lymphadenectomy may reduce the risk of regional recurrence. This article is

549,"OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Venous thromboembolic (VTE) events are emerging as 
frequent complications in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, there is 
insufficient data regarding epidemiology, risk factors and impact on outcomes. 
The optimal approach to balance risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage remains 
unclear. This retrospective single-center study in AML patients undergoing 
induction chemotherapy between 2007-2018 assessed incidence, risk factors, 
features and outcomes of early-onset VTE.
RESULTS: 423 patients (median age 59 years) were enrolled. VTE was diagnosed in 
31 patients (7.3 %) within 3 months of admission. The median time to VTE was 
3 days. Non-central venous catheter (CVC)-related VTE occurred in 19 patients 
(61 %). Main risk factor for VTE was leukocytosis at admission, independent of 
platelet counts/INR. Four patients (13 %) exhibited VTE recurrence. No deaths 
directly related to VTE or major bleeding events associated with 
platelet-adjusted anticoagulation in patients with VTE were recorded. There was 
no clear impact of VTE on one-year overall survival, however, non-CVC-related 
VTE may be associated with adverse outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset VTE is a common complication in newly diagnosed AML 
patients admitted for induction chemotherapy. Leukocytosis is an independent VTE 
risk factor. The potentially adverse impact of non-CVC-related VTE merits 
further study. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
550,"The prognostic significance of body mass index in lung cancer and the direction 
of this relationship are not yet clear. This study aimed to evaluate the 
relationship between BMI and overall survival time of advanced-stage lung cancer 
patients treated in a center in Turkey, a developing country. In this study, the 
data of 225 patients diagnosed with stage III or stage IV lung cancer between 
2016 and 2020 were analyzed. The effects of BMI and other variables on survival 
were examined by Cox regression analysis for NSCLC and SCLC. For NSCLC and SCLC, 
being underweight compared to the normal group, being diagnosed at a more 
advanced stage, and having a worse performance score were associated with a 
significantly higher risk of death. Other variables significantly associated 
with survival were gender, type of radiotherapy for NSCLC, age group, and family 
history for SCLC. This study showed that being underweight relative to the 
normal group was associated with worse survival for NSCLC and SCLC but did not 
support the obesity paradox. Studies that are representative of all BMI 
categories and free of bias are needed to understand the BMI-lung cancer 
survival relationship clearly."
551,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are contingent upon clinical manifestations 
and serological markers. However, researchers are struggling to find biomarkers 
with higher sensitivity and specificity. DNA methylation has been the most 
studied epigenetic feature in SLE. So, in this study, we performed a systematic 
review of studies about DNA methylation alterations in SLE patients compared to 
healthy controls.
METHODS: By searching PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to July 2022, all 
case-control studies in which DNA methylation of specific genes was assessed by 
a non-high-throughput technique and passed the quality of bias assessment were 
included.
RESULTS: In total, 44 eligible studies underwent a data extraction process. In 
all, 3471 SLE patients and 1028 healthy individuals were included. Among the 
studies that reported the patients' gender (n = 2853), 89.41% were female and 
10.59% were male. Forty studies have been conducted on adult patients. The 
number of works on fractionated and unfractionated blood cells was almost equal. 
In this regard, 22 studies were conducted on whole blood or peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells and two studies on unfractionated white blood cells. Sorted 
blood cells were biological sources in 20 studies. The most investigated gene 
was IFI44L. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic power of methylation levels 
were only reported for IFI44L in five studies. The most employed methylation 
profiling method was bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction. The 
correlation between methylation patterns and clinical parameters was explored in 
22 studies, which of them 16 publications displayed a remarkable association 
between DNA methylation status and clinical indices.
CONCLUSIONS: The methylation status of some genes especially IFI44L, FOXP3, and 
MX1 has been suggested as promising SLE biomarkers. However, given the 
conflicting findings between studies because of potential confounders such as 
different sample types, methylation profiling methods, and ethnicity as well as 
shared DNA methylation patterns of SLE and other autoimmune diseases, DNA 
methylation biomarkers are currently not reliable diagnostic biomarkers and do 
not represent surrogate markers of SLE disease activity. Future investigations 
on a larger scale with the discarding of limitations of previous studies would 
probably lead to a consensus."
552,"Studies prior to next-generation sequencing (NGS) showed that the frequent 
indolent course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is related to most cells 
remaining quiescent in the G0 -G1 cell cycle phase, due to the expression of 
dysregulated cyclin genes. Of note, the activating nature of the NOTCH1 mutation 
in T lymphoblastic leukaemia also drives the dysregulation of cell cycle genes. 
Our goal was to comprehensively revisit the cell cycle in NOTCH1-mutated CLL 
(NOTCH1MUT ) to test for potential therapeutic targets. Among 378 NGS-annotated 
CLL cases, NOTCH1MUT cells displayed a unique transcriptome profile of G0 -G1 
cell cycle components, with an overexpression of early-phase effectors, reaching 
a 38-, 27- and ninefold change increase for the complex elements CCND3, CDK4 and 
CDK6, respectively. This NOTCH1MUT cells' profile was related to more cells 
traversing through the cell cycle. In-vitro targeted inhibition of NOTCH1 
gamma-secretase and CDK4/6 reversed the distribution of cells through the cycle 
phases and enhanced the killing of NOTCH1MUT CLL cells, suggesting new 
therapeutic approaches."
553,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
have been successively concluded. Our aim is to determine the efficacy of 
amyloid-β (Aβ) PET in diagnosing AD and early prediction of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) converting to AD. By pooling studies from different centers to 
explore in-depth whether diagnostic performance varies by population type, 
radiotracer type, and diagnostic approach, thus providing a more comprehensive 
theoretical basis for the subsequent widespread application of Aβ PET in the 
clinical setting.
METHODS: Relevant studies were searched through PubMed. The pooled 
sensitivities, specificities, DOR, and the summary ROC curve were obtained based 
on a Bayesian random-effects model.
RESULTS: Forty-eight studies, including 5967 patients, were included. Overall, 
the pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and AUC of Aβ PET for diagnosing AD 
were 0.90, 0.80, 35.68, and 0.91, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that Aβ 
PET had high sensitivity (0.91) and specificity (0.81) for differentiating AD 
from normal controls but very poor specificity (0.49) for determining AD from 
MCI. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.84 and 0.62, respectively, 
for predicting the conversion of MCI to AD. The differences in diagnostic 
efficacy between visual assessment and quantitative analysis and between 11 
C-PIB PET and 18 F-florbetapir PET were insignificant.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall performance of Aβ PET in diagnosing AD is favorable, 
but the differentiation between MCI and AD patients should consider that some 
MCI may be at risk of conversion to AD and may be misdiagnosed. A multimodal 
diagnostic approach and machine learning analysis may be effective in improving 
diagnostic accuracy."

555,"OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore the effect of circ_0008003 on the 
progression of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its underlying regulation 
mechanism.
METHODS: Expression of hsa_circ_0008003, miRNA (miR)-548I and karyopherin 
subunit α 4 (KPNA4) was examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction. Cell viability and proliferation ability were detected by cell 
counting kit-8 assay and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, respectively. Flow 
cytometry was performed to monitor cell apoptosis. Western blot assay was used 
to evaluate the protein levels of KPNA4, Bax, and Bcl-2. Cell migration and 
invasion were assessed by transwell assays. The targeted relationship between 
miR-548I and hsa_circ_0008003 or KPNA4 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter 
and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, the role of hsa_circ_0008003 in 
vivo was investigated by xenograft assay.
RESULTS: Circ_0008003 expression was increased in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. 
Circ_0008003 knockdown reduced cell viability, migration, invasion, 
angiogenesis, and caused apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Moreover, miR-548I was 
targeted by circ_0008003, and miR-548I knockdown reversed the influence of 
circ_0008003 silence on NSCLC progression. KPNA4 was targeted by miR-548I, and 
miR-548I overexpression suppressed cell viability, migration, invasion, 
angiogenesis, and promoted cell apoptosis via decreasing KPNA4. In addition, 
circ_0008003 regulated KPNA4 expression via miR-548I. Circ_0008003 knockdown 
decreased NSCLC cell growth in the xenograft model.
CONCLUSION: Circular RNA hsa_circ_0008003 promoted progression in NSCLC by 
sponging miR-548I and regulating KPNA4 expression, hinting that circ_0008003 
participates in NSCLC pathogenesis."
556,"BACKGROUND: In Japan, microsatellite instability (MSI) testing for solid tumors 
was introduced in clinical practice in December 2018. Although immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs) are established standards of care for patients with MSI-high 
tumors, the status of implementing MSI testing in clinical practice remains 
unclear.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with solid 
tumors who underwent MSI testing between January 2019 and December 2020 at our 
institution.
RESULTS: In total, 1,052 MSI tests were performed in 1,047 patients. Regardless 
of specimen volume and condition, the MSI status was successfully determined in 
1,041 (99.0%) tests, encompassing 27 tumor types (microsatellite stable [MSS] or 
MSI-low: n = 991 [95.2%] and MSI-high: n = 50 [4.8%]). Patients whose specimens 
were fixed with 20% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) and who had specimens with 
prolonged storage (98.4% and 95.4%) showed lower success rates than those whose 
specimens were fixed with 10% NBF and who had specimens with nonprolonged 
storage (100.0% and 99.6%), respectively. The prolonged turnaround time (TAT) in 
MSI-high cases (median TAT: 24 days) was a critical issue that directly resulted 
in treatment delay. Of the 50 patients with MSI-high tumors, 24 (48.0%) received 
ICIs and 34 (68.0%) were referred to the Department of Clinical Genetic Oncology 
where 6 (12.0%) patients were diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: MSI testing was successfully performed for various types of tumors 
and specimens in clinical practice. Our study results identified certain issues 
associated with the clinical implementation of MSI testing, including optimal 
specimen selection, extended TAT in MSI-high cases, and awareness of hereditary 
tumors."
557,"BACKGROUND: Genomic profile analysis using next-generation sequencing can 
potentially elucidate the pathogenesis of rare cancers. Ductal adenocarcinoma, a 
rare subtype of prostate cancer, has an aggressive nature. This is the first 
study to analyze the genomic profile of ductal adenocarcinoma in an Asian 
population.
METHODS: We identified 12 patients newly diagnosed with ductal adenocarcinoma of 
the prostate at two hospitals, and nine patients (75.0%) had the pure type. 
Genomic assessment was performed using either the PleSSision testing platform or 
FoundationOne CDx.
RESULTS: At least one genomic alteration occurred in 11 patients (91.7%), and 
the most frequently mutated gene was tumor suppressor protein p53 (TP53), which 
was found in six cases (50.0%). Alterations characteristic of this cohort were 
found in four cases (33.3%) of retinoblastoma transcriptional corepressor 1 
(RB1), which was only observed in the pure type. Compared to previous study 
results, the frequency of genetic alterations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
(PI3K) pathway (n = 3; 25.0%) and Wnt-β-catenin pathway (n = 5; 41.7%) was 
comparable, but no alterations in the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway were 
observed. None of the patients presented high tumor mutation burden or 
microsatellite instability.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that the Asian cohort with ductal adenocarcinoma had 
actionable alterations, and a high frequency of alterations in TP53 and RB1 
reflected the aggressive nature of the tumor. Genetic analysis using 
next-generation sequencing is expected to help elucidate the pathogenesis of 
ductal adenocarcinoma."
558,"BACKGROUND: A recent survey of pediatric hematology oncology (PHO) physicians 
identified that a majority believe fellows are struggling to find jobs that 
align with their goals. Career development for trainees has historically been 
home institution-specific, limiting fellows' exposures to career path 
possibilities. The ""virtual-Symposium of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology of New 
York (v-SYMPHONY)"" instituted a tristate Career Development Series for PHO 
trainees to better address their needs and increase awareness of the variety of 
PHO career opportunities.
PROCEDURE: The v-SYMPHONY Career Development Series incorporated three sessions: 
(a) institutional perspective, (b) individual perspectives, and (c) nuts and 
bolts of job search. Pre- and post-series surveys were administered to 
participants to measure impact.
RESULTS: Forty-one fellows registered for the series and completed a pre-survey. 
Over half (54%) were in their third or later year of fellowship. Careers with a 
clinical focus were the most commonly desired career path (59%). Most had 
received career development advice only from faculty within their institutions 
(90%). Post-surveys were completed by 11 PHO fellows. Overall, 100% of 
respondents reported benefiting from the career sessions and recommended the 
series should be repeated annually. Over 90% learned new information to prepare 
for the job search.
CONCLUSIONS: The v-SYMPHONY Career Development Series for PHO fellows across 
multiple institutions was established and was extremely well received by its 
participants. PHO fellows agreed that these sessions were beneficial in helping 
prepare them for the job search process. An annual regional Career Development 
Series is feasible and is strongly suggested to support PHO fellows."
559,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the leading cause 
of pediatric cancer mortality. Research addressing genomic biomarkers and 
clinical outcomes is needed to inform therapeutic decision-making.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of pediatric patients (age <21) 
diagnosed with a primary CNS tumor at four upstate New York hospitals from 2008 
to 2021. Clinical and histopathologic data were identified from each patient, 
including genomic analysis of somatic mutations and tumor mutational burden 
(TMB) where available. These variables were each compared with overall survival 
using Cox regression analyses. Multivariable analysis was conducted to identify 
patient characteristics that may independently predict survival.
RESULTS: We identified 119 patients. Common tumor types included low-grade 
glioma (N = 51), high-grade glioma (N = 29), and medulloblastoma (N = 11). 
Common driver mutations included TP53 inactivation (N = 16), BRAF-KIAA1549 
fusion (N = 16), FGFR1 amplification (N = 12), BRAF V600E mutation (N = 12), NF1 
loss (N = 12), and H3F3A K28M mutation (N = 6). Median TMB was one 
mutation/megabase (mut/Mb, range = 0-132). Overall survival was 79.9%. Variables 
associated with poorer survival on univariable analysis were higher TMB 
(p = .002, HR 4.97), high-grade tumors (p = .009, HR 84.3), and high-grade 
glioma histology (p = .021, HR 3.14). Multivariable analyses further identified 
TMB (p = .011, HR 4.46) and high-grade histology (p = .015, HR 5.28) as 
independently predictive of worse survival. Tumor progression was more common in 
high-TMB (N = 15, 44%) than in low-TMB tumors (N = 19, 35%).
CONCLUSIONS: High TMB is correlated with higher rates of progression and death 
as compared to low-TMB tumors. These findings may help identify patients who may 
benefit from alternative treatments, such as immunotherapies."
560,"Anti-cancer drug formulation Apalutamide 60mg tablets related substances method 
was developed and validated by using liquid chromatography gradient elution 
method. All the impurities and degradants were separated by using the Luna Omega 
5μm Polar C18, (250 x 4.6) mm HPLC column with a 1.0 mLmin-1 flow rate. The 
detection was done at 225 nm by injecting the 10 μL of injection volume by 
controlling the sample temperature at 10 °C and maintaining the column 
compartment temperature at 30 °C. The total run time was 85 mins. 0.01M Di 
sodium Phosphate dihydrate pH 4.20 ± 0.05 buffer mixed with acetonitrile in the 
ratio of 73:27 (v/v) used as mobile phase A. Mobile phase B consists of water

four impurities. The accuracy results were obtained between 96.0 % to 106.3 % 
for LOQ to 150 % level. The standard and sample solutions stability were 
established for 44 hrs at 10 °C. The correlation coefficient (r) value is > 
0.999 found for all the four impurities, indicating good linearity between 
concentration and peak response. 0.9999, 0.9999, 0.9999, and 1.0000 these 
results express the method linearity. Available three filter compatibility was 
proven and concluded that 0.45μm Nylon, PTFE, and PVDF filters are suitable. The 
robustness of the method was established by varying all the conditions. The 
method specificity was proven and the forced degradation data reveals the 
method's stability-indicating nature."
561,"BACKGROUND: IFNL4 genetic variants that are strongly associated with clearance 
of hepatitis C virus have been linked to risk of certain opportunistic 
infections (OIs) and cancers, including Kaposi sarcoma, cytomegalovirus 
infection, and herpes simplex virus infection. As the interferon (IFN) λ family 
plays a role in response to viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, IFNL4 
genotype might affect risk for a wide range of OIs/cancers.
METHODS: We examined associations between genotype for the functional IFNL4 
rs368234815 polymorphism and incidence of 16 OIs/cancers among 2310 men with 
human immunodeficiency virus (2038 white; 272 black) enrolled in the Multicenter 
AIDS Cohort Study during 1984-1990. Our primary analyses used Cox proportional 
hazards models adjusted for self-reported racial ancestry to estimate hazard 
ratios with 95% confidence intervals, comparing participants with the genotypes 
that generate IFN-λ4 and those with the genotype that abrogates IFN-λ4. We 
censored follow-up at the introduction of highly effective antiretroviral 
therapies.
RESULTS: We found no statistically significant association between IFNL4 
genotype and the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma (hazard ratio, 0.92 [95% confidence 
interval, .76-1.11]), cytomegalovirus infection (0.94 [.71-1.24]), herpes 
simplex virus infection (1.37 [.68-2.93]), or any other OI/cancer. We observed 
consistent results using additive genetic models and after controlling for CD4 
cell count through time-dependent adjustment or restriction to participants with 
a low CD4 cell count.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of associations between IFNL4 genotype and these 
OIs/cancers provides evidence that this gene does not affect the risk of disease 
from opportunistic pathogens."
562,"The kidney tubule consists of a single layer of epithelial cells supported by 
the tubular basement membrane (TBM), a thin layer of specialized extracellular 
matrix (ECM). The mechanical properties of the ECM are important for regulating 
a wide range of cell functions including proliferation, differentiation and cell 
survival. Increased ECM stiffness plays a role in promoting multiple 
pathological conditions including cancer, fibrosis and heart disease. How 
changes in TBM mechanics regulate tubular epithelial cell behavior is not fully 
understood. Here we introduce a cell culture system that utilizes in 
vivo-derived TBM to investigate cell-matrix interactions in kidney proximal 
tubule cells. Basement membrane mechanics was controlled using genipin, a 
biocompatibility crosslinker. Genipin modification resulted in a dose-dependent 
increase in matrix stiffness. Crosslinking had a marginal but statistically 
significant impact on the diffusive molecular transport properties of the TBM, 
likely due to a reduction in pore size. Both native and genipin-modified TBM 
substrates supported tubular epithelial cell growth. Cells were able to attach 
and proliferate to form confluent monolayers. Tubular epithelial cells polarized 
and assembled organized cell-cell junctions. Genipin modification had minimal 
impact on cell viability and proliferation. Genipin stiffened TBM increased gene 
expression of pro-fibrotic cytokines and altered gene expression for N-cadherin, 
a proximal tubular epithelial specific cell-cell junction marker. This work 
introduces a new cell culture model for cell-basement membrane mechanobiology 
studies that utilizes in vivo-derived basement membrane. We also demonstrate 
that TBM stiffening affects tubular epithelial cell function through altered 
gene expression of cell-specific differentiation markers and induced increased 
expression of pro-fibrotic growth factors."
563,"BACKGROUND: Despite the conventional cancer therapeutic, cancer treatment 
remains a medical challenge due to neoplasm metastasis and cancer recurrence, 
therefore, new approaches promoting therapeutic strategies are highly desirable. 
As a new therapy, the use of whole neoplastic stem cells or cancer stem cell 
(CSC)-based vaccines is one strategy to overcome these obstacles. We 
investigated the effects of whole CSC-based vaccines on the solid tumor 
development, metastasis, and survival rate.
METHODS: Primary electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Web 
of Science), and a major clinical registry were searched. Interventional studies 
of whole CSC-based vaccines in rodent cancer models (38 studies), and human 
cancer patients (11 studies) were included; the vaccine preparation 
methodologies, effects, and overall outcomes were evaluated.
RESULTS: Preclinical studies were divided into four groups, CSC-lysates/ 
inactivated-CSC-based vaccines, CSC-lysate-loaded dendritic cell (CSC-DC) 
vaccines, cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) vaccines generated with CSC-DC (CSC-DC-CTL), 
and combinatorial treatments carried out in the prophylactic and therapeutic 
experimental models. The majority of preclinical studies reported a promising 
effect on tumor growth, survival rate, and metastasis. Moreover, whole CSC-based 
vaccines induced several antitumor immune responses. A small number of clinical 
investigations suggested that the whole CSC-based vaccine treatment is 
beneficial, however further research is required.
CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive review provides an overview of the available 
methods for assessing the efficacy of whole CSC-based vaccines on tumor 
development, metastasis, and survival rate. In addition, it presents a set of 
recommendations for designing high-quality clinical studies that may allow to 
determine the efficacy of whole CSC-based-vaccines in cancer therapy."
564,"BACKGROUND: Although pre-clinical experiments associate cannabinoids with 
reduced depressive symptoms, there is a paucity of clinical evidence. This study 
aimed to analyze the health-related quality of life changes and safety outcomes 
in patients prescribed cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs) for depression.
METHODS: An uncontrolled case series of the UK Medical Cannabis Registry was 
analyzed. Primary outcomes were changes from baseline in the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Sleep Quality 
Scale (SQS), and EQ-5D-5L at 1, 3, and 6 months. Secondary outcomes included 
adverse events incidence.
RESULTS: 129 patients were identified for inclusion. Median PHQ-9 at baseline 
was 16.0 (IQR: 9.0-21.0). There were reductions in PHQ-9 at 1-month (median: 
8.0; IQR: 4.0-14.0; p<0.001), 3-months (7.0; 2.3-12.8; p<0.001), and 6-months 
(7.0; 2.0-9.5; p<0.001). Improvements were also observed in GAD-7, SQS, and 
EQ-5D-5L Index Value at 1, 3, and 6 months (p<0.050). 153 (118.6%) adverse 
events were recorded by 14.0% (n=18) of participants, 87% (n=133) of which were 
mild or moderate.
CONCLUSION: CBMP treatment was associated with reductions in depression severity 
at 1, 3, and 6 months. Limitations of the study design mean that a causal 
relationship cannot be proven. This analysis provides insights for further study 
within clinical trial settings."
565,"BACKGROUND: The setup of lung shield (LS) in total body irradiation (TBI) with 
the computed radiography (CR) system is a time-consuming task and has not been 
quantitatively evaluated. The TBI mobile imager (TBI-MI) can solve this problem 
through real-time monitoring. Therefore, this study aimed to perform 
commissioning and performance evaluation of TBI-MI to promote its use in 
clinical practice.
METHODS: The source-axis distance in TBI treatment, TBI-MI (CNERGY TBI, Cablon 
Medical B.V.), and the LS position were set to 400, 450, and 358 cm, 
respectively. The evaluation items were as follows: accuracy of image scaling 
and measured displacement error of LS, image quality (linearity, signal-to-noise 
ratio, and modulation transfer function) using an EPID QC phantom, optimal 
thresholding to detect intra-fractional motion in the alert function, and the 
scatter radiation dose from TBI-MI.
RESULTS: The accuracy of image scaling and the difference in measured 
displacement of the LS was <4 mm in any displacements and directions. The image 
quality of TBI imager was slightly inferior to the CR image but was visually 
acceptable in clinical practice. The signal-to-noise ratio was improved at high 
dose rate. The optimal thresholding value to detect a 10-mm body displacement 
was determined to be approximately 5.0%. The maximum fraction of scattering 
radiation to irradiated dose was 1.7% at patient surface.
CONCLUSION: MI-TBI can quantitatively evaluate LS displacement with acceptable 
image quality. Furthermore, real-time monitoring with alert function to detect 
intrafraction patient displacement can contribute to safe TBI treatment."
566,"PURPOSE: Single-visit radiotherapy (RT) is beneficial for patients requiring 
pain control and can limit interruptions to systemic treatments. However, the 
requirement for a dedicated planning CT (pCT)-scan can result in treatment 
delays. We developed a workflow involving preplanning on available diagnostic CT 
(dCT) imaging, followed by online plan adaption using a cone-beam CT (CBCT)-scan 
prior to RT-delivery, in order to account for any changes in anatomy and target 
position.
METHODS: Patients previously treated with palliative RT for bone metastases were 
selected from our hospital database. Patient dCT-images were deformed to 
treatment CBCTs in the Ethos platform (Varian Medical Systems) and a synthetic 
CT (sCT) generated. Treatment quality was analyzed by comparing a coverage of 
the V95% of the planning/clinical target volume and different organ-at-risk 
(OAR) doses between adapted and initial clinical treatment plans. Doses were 
recalculated on the CBCT and sCT in a separate treatment planning system. 
Adapted plan doses were measured on-couch using an anthropomorphic phantom with 
a Gafchromic EBT3 dosimetric film and compared to dose calculations.
RESULTS: All adapted treatment plans met the clinical goals for target and OARs 
and outperformed the original treatment plans calculated on the (daily) sCT. 
Differences in V95% of the target volume coverage between the initial and 
adapted treatments were <0.2%. Dose recalculations on CBCT and sCT were 
comparable, and the average gamma pass rate (3%/2 mm) of dosimetric measurements 
was 98.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: Online daily adaptive RT using dCTs instead of a dedicated pCT is 
feasible using the Ethos platform. This workflow has now been implemented 
clinically."
567,"While multiple mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the therapeutic 
effect of lymph node (LN) yield in patients with urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) 
undergoing radical cystectomy (RC), the effect of stage migration, commonly 
known as the Will Rogers effect, is often discounted. We reviewed the National 
Cancer Database for patients with UCC undergoing RC with pathologically 
node-negative (pN0) disease from 2004 to 2016. We tested for an adjusted 
association between LN yield and overall survival using multivariable Cox 
proportional-hazard models. Median survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method. We identified 19 939 patients with pN0 UCC treated with RC. After 
adjustment, patients in the highest quantile for LN yield (≥26 LNs) had a 34% 
lower risk of death in comparison to patients in the lowest quantile (≤5 LNs). 
As we increased the threshold for LN yield for dichotomization from >5 to >15 to 
>25 LNs, median survival increased from 83 to 95 to 103 mo. The pN0 group with 
higher LN yield appeared to live longer in this analysis owing to the 
mathematical artifact of how patients are indexed. Resection of a greater number 
of negative LNs will lead to higher fidelity for pN0 cohorts being evaluated, as 
the likelihood of contamination by pN+ cases that were missed will be lower.
PATIENT SUMMARY: A strategy to dissect a high number of lymph nodes in patients 
undergoing removal of their bladder for bladder cancer can be associated with 
side effects, and the benefit in terms of cancer control or survival remains 
uncertain. Urologists and their patients should engage in shared decision-making 
and consider the risks and benefits of more extensive lymph node dissection 
during surgery."
568,"The idea of cancer immunotherapy has spread, and it has made tremendous progress 
with the advancement of new technology. Immunotherapy, which serves to assist 
the natural defenses of the body in eradicating cancerous cells, is a remarkable 
achievement that has revolutionized both cancer research and cancer treatments. 
Currently, the use of stem cells in immunotherapy is widespread and shares a 
special characteristic, including cancer cell migration, bioactive component 
release, and immunosuppressive activity. In the context of cancer, mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSCs) are rapidly being identified as vital stromal regulators of 
tumor progression. MSCs therapy has been implicated in treating a wide range of 
diseases, including bone damage, autoimmune diseases, and particularly 
hematopoietic abnormalities, providing stem cell-based therapy with an extra 
dimension. Moreover, the implication of MSCs does not have ethical concerns, and 
the complications known in pluripotent and totipotent stem cells are less common 
in MSCs. MSCs have a lot of distinctive characteristics that, when coupled, make 
them excellent for cellular-based immunotherapy and as vehicles for gene and 
drug delivery in a variety of inflammations and malignancies. MSCs can migrate 
to the inflammatory site and exert immunomodulatory responses via cell-to-cell 
contacts with lymphocytes by generating soluble substances. In the current 
review, we discuss the most recent research on the immunological characteristics 
of MSCs, their use as immunomodulatory carriers, techniques for approving MSCs 
to adjust their immunological contour, and their usages as vehicles for 
delivering therapeutic as well as drugs and genes engineered to destroy tumor 
cells."
569,"BACKGROUND: Realgar, a Chinese herbal decoction, has been used to treat various 
types of tumors with positive outcomes; however, there is a lack of convincing 
evidence on its use for the treatment of esophageal cancer (EC). In this study, 
the role of the p62-Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway in the regulation of EC cell 
proliferation, migration, and ferroptosis in response to realgar was assessed.
METHODS: Different concentrations of realgar (0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 
µmol/L) were applied to the EC cell lines Eca109 and KYSE150. The inhibition 
rate and half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) were determined using the Cell 
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method. Subsequently, the cells were treated with realgar 
(1/2IC50, IC50, 2IC50). Cell migration was measured using the scratch assay, and 
cell invasion was measured using the transwell assay. The mRNA expression of 
p62, Keap1, and Nrf2 was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT-PCR), and the protein expression of p62, Keap1, Nrf2, matrix 
metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, E-cadherin, Slug, N-cadherin, and vimentin was 
measured by Western blot. The control, 2IC50, shRNA-NC, shRNA-p62, 2IC50 + 
shRNA-NC, 2IC50 + shRNA-p62, shRNA-Keap1, 2IC50 + shRNA-Keap1, and 2IC50 + 
shRNA-p62 + shRNA-Keap1 groups were defined. The CCK-8 method was used to 
measure the cell inhibition rate, and the clone formation assay was used to 
measure the clone formation ability. Moreover, the scratch assay was used to 
detect the cell migration ability, and the transwell assay was used to detect 
the cell invasion ability. Transmission electron microscopy was used to observe 
the mitochondrial morphology, Prussian blue staining was used to observe the 
intracellular iron particle distribution, and flow cytometry was used to detect 
changes in intracellular reactive oxygen species. In addition, qRT-PCR was 
performed to detect p62, Keap1, Nrf2, and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) mRNA 
expression, and Western blot was performed to detect p62, Keap1, Nrf2, 
E-cadherin, Slug, N-cadherin, and GPX4 protein expression.
RESULTS: Realgar inhibited Eca109 and KYSE150 cell proliferation in a time- and 
concentrationdependent manner. It also significantly inhibited the migration and 
invasion of Eca109 and KYSE150 cells and affected the mRNA and protein 
expression of p62, Keap1, and Nrf2. In response to realgar, low p62 expression 
inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of Eca109 and KYSE150 
cells, as well as ferroptosis induction.
CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that inhibiting the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 
signaling pathway promotes the inhibitory effects of realgar on EC cells."
570,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the highly aggressive 
malignancies and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Despite recent 
advancements, the overall therapeutic responses in PDAC patients remained 
relatively low or short-lived. While KRAS is the most frequently mutated 
proto-oncogene and represents a critical driver, it remains challenging to 
target all mutant variants. Thus, strategies to target the downstream signaling 
cascades (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK) in PDAC were associated with improved response rates. 
Nevertheless, the activation of other oncogenic cascades, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, 
has also been documented within the same context and implicated in the 
development of acquired tumor resistance mechanisms and/or reduced efficacy of 
therapeutic agents. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of overlapping and 
intersecting pathways is required to overcome the tumor resistance mechanisms to 
devise novel approaches to enhance the effectiveness of ongoing treatment 
options. The current review highlights the mechanistic insights from cellular 
and preclinical studies with particular emphasis on KRAS (i.e., MEK and 
ERK)-based approaches for PDAC treatment."
571,"BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the most important barriers to increasing life 
expectancy in all countries in the 21st century. Investigations of new 
anti-cancer drugs with low side effects are an urgent demand for medicinal 
chemists. Considering the known antitumor and immunomodulatory activity of 
thiazoles, this work presents the synthesis and antineoplastic activity of new 
thiazoles.
METHODS: The 22 new compounds (2a-v) were synthesized from different 
thiosemicarbazones and 2-bromoacetophenone. The compounds were evaluated on: 
MOLT-4, HL-60, HL-60/MX1, MM1S, SKMEL-28, DU145, MCF-7, and T47d.
RESULTS: Compound 2b induced cellular viability on MOLT-4 (37.1%), DU145 
(41.5%), and HL-60/MX1 (58.8%) cells. On MOLT-4 cells, compound 2b exhibited an 
IC50 of 8.03 μM, and against DU145 cells, an IC50 of 6.04μM. Besides, at IC50 
and fold of IC50, 20% to 30% of dead cells were found, most due to necrosis/late 
apoptosis. Most compounds showed no cytotoxicity against fibroblast cells L929 
at the concentrations tested. The compound did not alter the cell cycle of DU145 
cells when compared to the negative control. Therefore, compound 2b stands out 
against DU145 and MOLT-4 cells.
CONCLUSION: Our study reinforced the importance of 1,3-thiazoles nuclei in 
antitumor activity. In addition, derivative 2b stands out against DU145 and 
MOLT-4 cells and could be a starting point for developing new antineoplastic 
agents."
572,"BACKGROUND: The synthesis of conjugates with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs could improve their activity with less toxicity and these compounds could 
be used for the treatment of cancer.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present investigation was the synthesis of 
3,5-bis(dodecyloxy)benzoate -PAMAM conjugates with indomethacin and mefenamic 
acid to examine their anticancer activity.
METHODS: The anticancer activity was studied of the conjugates against six human 
cancer cells U-251, PC-3, K-562, HCT-15, MCF-7, SKLU-1, and the COS-7 (as a 
control) cell lines. The conjugates with indomethacin and mefenamic acid were 
characterized by 1H, 13C NMR one- and two-dimension spectroscopy.
RESULTS: All the conjugates synthetized with indomethacin or mefenamic acid 
showed anticancer activity against all the human cancer cell lines. The first 
generation of indomethacin conjugates showed better activity against the PC-3 
(human prostatic adenocarcinoma) cell line than the second generation. But the 
second generation with indomethacin showed better activity against PC-3 than the 
first generation. The second-generation conjugate with mefenamic acid had strong 
selectivity to PC-3 cells with an IC50 value of 10.23±1.2 M in vitro.
CONCLUSION: In the paper, we report the synthesis and spectroscopic analyses of 
new indomethacin or mefenamic acid conjugates. The overall results showed that 
the conjugate of the second generation with mefenamic acid could be a potential 
nanocarrier for human prostatic adenocarcinoma cancer treatment, our research 
will be continued."
573,"BACKGROUND: Several chromene derivatives have a wide variety of biological and 
pharmacological activity. They had anticancer activity, antimicrobial activity, 
antituberculosis activity, anticonvulsant activity, antidiabetic activity, 
antichlolinesterase activity, and inhibitor of monoamine oxidase activity. The 
above-mentioned activities directed us to synthesize novel chromene derivatives, 
chromeno[2,3-d][1,3]oxazines, and chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidines. The starting 
material was 
2-amino-8-(2-chlorobenzylidene)-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile.
METHODS: Several novel chromene derivatives had been synthesized. Compound 1 
reacted with carbon disulfide, and ethyl chloroformate to afford chromene 
derivatives 2, 3. Chromene derivative 3 reacted with hydrazine dydrate to give 
compound 4. Chromene derivative 1 reacted with acetic acid and sulphuric acid to 
produce compounds 5, and 6. Amino derivative 5 reacted with chloro acyl 
derivative to afford compounds 7a-c which cycalized in dry xylene to afford 
compounds 8a-c. Chromene derivative 8a reacted with hydroxyl amine to afford 
compound 9.
RESULTS: The structures of novel synthesized chromene derivatives had been 
confirmed using mass spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Most of the prepared compounds 
were screened against liver cancer cell lines (HepG-2), human colon cancer cell 
lines (HT-29), and breast adenocarcinoma cell lines (MCF-7). Chromene derivative 
2 had anticancer activity against human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29) higher 
than the reference drug doxorubicin. The rest of the tested compounds had 
anticancer activity against human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29) lower than 
that of the reference drug doxorubicin. Chromene derivative 5 had anticancer 
activity against liver cancer cell lines (HepG-2) higher than the reference drug 
doxorubicin.
CONCLUSION: Several chromene derivatives had been synthesized and their 
structures had been confirmed using different spectroscopic techniques. Some of 
the chromene derivatives that were screened against different cancer cell lines 
showed promising anticancer activity higher than the reference standard drug. 
For example, chromene derivative 2 had anticancer activity against human colon 
cancer cell lines (HT-29) higher than the reference drug doxorubicin. Chromene 
derivative 5 had anticancer activity against liver cancer cell lines (HepG-2) 
higher than the reference drug doxorubicin. Chromene derivative 6 had anticancer 
activity against breast adenocarcinoma cell lines (MCF-7) higher than the 
standard drug."
574,"BACKGROUND: Xanthones, natural or synthetic, due to their wide range of 
biological activities, have become an interesting subject of investigation for 
many researchers. Xanthonic scaffold has proven to have a vital role in 
anticancer drug development since many of its derivatives have shown anticancer 
activities on various cell lines. In addition, targeting epigenetic markers in 
cancer has yielded promising results. There have also been reports on the impact 
of xanthone and related polyphenolic compounds on epigenetics markers in cancer 
prevention and therapy.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to comprehensively highlight the main 
natural and non-natural sources of xanthones having potential anti-cancer 
effects along with their key structural elements, structure-activity 
relationships (SARs), mechanisms of action, and epigenetic profile of 
xanthone-based anti-cancer compounds. The challenges and future directions of 
xanthone-based therapies are also discussed briefly.
METHOD: The methods involved in the preparation of the present review included 
the collection of all recent information up to November 2021 from various 
scientific databases, indexed periodicals, and search engines such as Medline 
Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science, and Science 
Direct.
RESULTS: Exploration of the diversity of the xanthone scaffold led to the 
identification of several derivatives having prominent anti-cancer activity. 
Their unique structural diversity and synthetic modifications showed the ongoing 
endeavour of enriching the chemical diversity of the xanthone molecular 
framework to discover pharmacologically interesting compounds. However, studies 
regarding their modes of action, pharmacokinetic properties, clinical data, 
epigenetics, and safety are limited.
CONCLUSION: Elucidation of the exact biological mechanisms and the associated 
targets of xanthones will yield better opportunities for these compounds to be 
developed as potential anticancer drugs. Further clinical studies with 
conclusive results are required to implement xanthones as treatment modalities 
in cancer."
575,"We report the histopathological, immunohistochemical (IHC), and molecular 
findings in 3 patients with adult pancreatoblastoma, including 2 with autopsy 
features. The tumors were located in the tail and body of the pancreas, and the 
2 autopsy examinations revealed liver and lung metastases. Histopathologically 
the neoplasms were composed of solid epithelial elements with nested or 
trabecular growth patterns, fibrous stroma, and squamoid clusters. Keratin 19 
was positive mainly in squamoid corpuscles, and trypsin or chymotrypsin was 
positive in the acinar component. Neuroendocrine differentiation was observed in 
all tumors, and nuclear β-catenin expression in 2 tumors. Despite nuclear 
β-catenin expression, CTNNB1 mutation was found only in tumor 2. APC mutation 
was detected in tumor 1, and SMAD4 as well as MEN1 mutations in tumor 3. This 
last tumor also revealed chromosomal instability with many chromosomal losses 
and gains. The follow-up showed regional or distant metastases in all patients. 
Two patients died of disease after 3 and 26 months of follow-up and 1 patient is 
alive with no evidence of disease 6 years and 2 months after surgery. Adult 
pancreatoblastoma can display genetic heterogeneity, diverse histological 
appearance, and overlapping IHC findings. As a result, the differential 
diagnosis with other adult pancreatic tumors, such as acinar cell carcinoma, 
neuroendocrine neoplasm, solid pseudopapillary neoplasm, and mixed tumors may be 
challenging, especially when dealing with limited tumor tissue. The 
identification of squamoid corpuscles is essential for diagnosis. Although 
molecular findings might provide useful information, the integration of 
clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings is essential in 
pancreatoblastoma diagnosis."
576,"Background: Methylated SEPT9 (mSEPT9) has a role in the occurrence and 
development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we studied the significance 
of plasma mSEPT9 for predicting prognosis-associated pathological parameters in 
patients with HCC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data from 205 subjects, 
including 111 HCC patients, 53 patients with at-risk liver disease (ARD) and 41 
healthy donors (HDs). Analysis of plasma mSEPT9 was performed using 
methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Levels of mSEPT9 among different 
groups were compared using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test or a one-way 
ANOVA test. Correlations between pretreatment plasma mSEPT9 and 
clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed using the Chi-square. 
Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors related to 
microvascular invasion (MVI). Performance of variables for MVI prediction was 
evaluated by receiver operating characteristics curve. Results: A specific 
increase of plasma mSEPT9 in HCC was found when compared with ARD and HDs (HCC 
vs ARD, P  =  1.1  ×  10-5 and HCC vs HDs, P  =  3.7  ×  10-10). Pretreatment 
plasma mSEPT9 was significantly correlated tumor number (P  =  .004), tumor size 
(P  =  4.6  ×  10-5), MVI (P  =  .002) and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 
(P  =  .012). Levels of plasma mSEPT9 correlated significantly with Ki67 
expression in tumor (r  =  0.356, P  =  1.3  ×  10-4). Univariate and 
multivariate analyses showed that plasma mSEPT9 and serum protein induced by 
vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) were independent predictors for 
MVI. A combination of these 2 markers exhibited a larger areas under the curve 
(areas under the curve [AUC]  =  0.72) than mSEPT9 or PIVKA alone (AUC  =  0.67 
and 0.65), especially in early-stage HCC. Conclusions: Plasma mSEPT9 is a 
promising noninvasive biomarker for predicting MVI and tumor proliferation in 
HCC. Integration plasma mSEPT9 detection into clinical settings might facilitate 
the patient management."
577,"BACKGROUND Carney complex (CNC) is a rare multiple neoplasia syndrome with 
autosomal dominant inheritance. CNC is frequently misdiagnosed owing to its 
diverse clinical characteristics. We reported the case of a 14-year-old Saudi 
boy with a history of gynecomastia, Cushing syndrome, large-cell calcifying 
Sertoli cell tumor of the testis, and CNC. CASE REPORT The patient was referred 
to the pediatric endocrine clinic for evaluation of bilateral slow progressing 
gynecomastia for 1-year duration. His clinical examination revealed lentigenes, 
bilateral diffuse breast enlargement (consistent with Tanner stage III), and 
asymmetrical testicular enlargement, more on the left side. Other systemic 
examinations were unremarkable. The initial blood workup showed elevated 
estradiol level with unsuppressed cortisol after an overnight 1-mg dexamethasone 
suppression test. Breast ultrasound (US) confirmed true gynecomastia. Testicular 
US revealed microcalcification and the testicular biopsy confirmed diagnoses of 
large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumor (LCCSCT). A 2-step dexamethasone 
suppression test showed a paradoxical rise in serum and urine cortisol levels, 
which are characteristic for PPNAD. LCCSCT and PPNAD are 2 major criteria 
fulfilling a diagnosis of CNC. The gene test showed heterozygous mutation in the 
PRKAR1A gene, which is diagnostic for CNC. The patient underwent bilateral 
mastoplasty and was planned for radical left orchiectomy. CONCLUSIONS 
Gynecomastia and LCCSCT can be presenting features of CNC, which mandates 
careful, thorough clinical examination and tailored investigation to reach a 
diagnosis."
578,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the characteristics of venous 
thromboembolic disease (VTE) in Korean to Caucasian population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: XALIA-LEA and XALIA were phase IV non-interventional 
prospective studies with identical designs that investigated the effect of 
rivaroxaban versus standard anticoagulation for VTE. Koreans accounted for the 
largest proportion of the overall enrolled population of XALIA-LEA. However, in 
the XALIA study, most patients were Caucasian. Therefore, Korean data from 
XALIA-LEA and Caucasian data from XALIA were used in this study. This study 
compared the clinical characteristics and primary outcomes of the XALIA program, 
including major bleeding, recurrent VTE, and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: The Korean population was older, was less obese, and had more active 
cancer at baseline than the Caucasian population. Provoked VTE was more common 
in the Korean population. Interestingly, Koreans showed less accompanying 
thrombophilia than Caucasians, and factor V Leiden mutations were not detected. 
Korean analyses comparing the effects of rivaroxaban and standard 
anticoagulation with primary outcomes showed a lower incidence of major 
bleeding, recurrent VTE, and all-cause mortality with rivaroxaban. Similar 
results were obtained in the propensity score matching analysis.
CONCLUSION: Characteristic differences were found between Korean and Caucasian 
VTE patients. Despite these ethnic differences, the effectiveness and safety of 
rivaroxaban therapy in these patients were consistent."
579,"Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers, with a 
5-year survival rate of about 10%. Early warning signs and symptoms of 
pancreatic cancer are vague or nonexistent, and most patients are diagnosed in 
Stage IV, when surgery is not an option for about 80%-85% of patients. For 
patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer, current conventional treatment 
modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) have suboptimal efficacy. 
Tumor progression is closely associated with the tumor microenvironment, which 
includes peripheral blood vessels, bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells, 
fibroblasts, immune cells, signaling molecules, and extracellular matrix. Tumor 
cells affect the microenvironment by releasing extracellular signaling 
molecules, inducing peripheral immune tolerance, and promoting tumor 
angiogenesis. In turn, the immune cells of the tumor affect the survival and 
proliferation of cancer cells. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are key cellular 
components in the tumor microenvironment and exert immunosuppressive functions 
by producing cytokines, recognizing other immune cells, and promoting tumor 
growth and metastasis. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are the main regulator 
of the tumor immune response and a key target for tumor treatments. Since the 
combination of RT and immunotherapy is the main strategy for the treatment of 
pancreatic cancer, it is very important to understand the immune mechanisms 
which lead to MDSCs generation and the failure of current therapies in order to 
develop new target-based therapies. This review summarizes the research advances 
on the role of Myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the progression of pancreatic 
cancer and its treatment application in recent years."
580,"OBJECTIVES: This qualitative study examined how families share information and 
feelings about advanced pediatric cancer from the perspective of both parents 
and children, as well as how these perspectives vary by child developmental 
stage.
METHODS: Participants (24 mothers, 20 fathers, 23 youth [children and 
adolescents]) were from a larger longitudinal study at an academic pediatric 
hospital. Eligible youth had advanced cancer (physician-estimated prognosis of 
<60%, relapse, or refractory disease), were aged 5-19 years (>8 years old to 
participate independently), had an English-speaking parent, and lived within 140 
miles of the hospital. Interviews were completed at enrollment and asked how 
families share information and emotions about the child's cancer as a family.
RESULTS: Saturation was reached at 20 interviews for mothers, fathers, and 
youth. Analyses revealed 4 major themes: (A) parents managing cancer-related 
information based on child age/developmental stage and processing styles of 
family members; (B) parents withholding poor prognosis information and emotions 
to maintain positivity; (C) lack of personal and familial emotion sharing; and 
(D) emotion sharing among their family and externally. Both parents and youth 
endorsed themes A, C, and D, but only parents endorsed theme B. Adolescents 
endorsed more themes than children. Parents of children (as opposed to 
adolescents) endorsed theme A more.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Although both parents and youth with advanced cancer 
were generally willing to talk about treatment, emotions were not consistently 
shared. Perspectives varied depending on the child's developmental stage. 
Clinicians should assess parent and child information and emotion-sharing needs 
and provide individualized support to families regarding communication about 
advanced cancer."
581,"INTRODUCTION: Medicines Management Technicians have been shown to be an 
underused resource in medicines optimisation and medicines waste. In the United 
Kingdom, there are national recommendations for the clinical pharmacy service in 
cancer services ambulatory units, despite these recommendations, there was no 
clinical pharmacy service on the day case unit at a specialist tertiary centre 
in England. A lot of the patient pathways had been in place for many years and 
had not progressed with the changes in the clinical pathways. The main 
objectives of this study were to analyse how a medicines management technician 
could reduce medicines waste, improve the current pathway, increase medicines 
optimisation and ultimately improve the patient experience in an oncology day 
case unit at a specialist tertiary centre in England.
METHODS: A prospective mixed methods study was carried out at Weston Park 
Hospital. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted on the quantitative 
data collected, and thematic analysis was carried out on the qualitative data 
collected by questionnaire to staff members and patients.
RESULTS: This study has shown that a medicines management technician can 
complete some of the tasks more traditionally done by the chemotherapy nurses on 
the day case unit, increasing their capacity for more clinically appropriate 
tasks. A medicines management technician can work as part of the wider 
multidisciplinary team on a day case unit contributing to medicines optimisation 
and cost savings for the oncology directorate.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that a medicines management technician can act 
as a valued member of the wider multidisciplinary team, improving communication 
and patient pathways, improving medicines optimisation and contributing to cost 
saving initiatives. Further studies are required to assess whether a medicines 
management technician role can be of the same value on a haematology day case 
unit."
582,"BACKGROUND: Although many biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) have been 
identified, their specificity and sensitivity remain unsatisfactory. Endothelial 
lipase gene (LIPG) plays an important role in a variety of cancers, but its role 
in lung adenocarcinoma remains unclear.
METHODS: TCGA, GEO, K-M plotter, CIBERSORT, GSEA, HPA, and GDSC were used to 
analyze LIPG in LUAD. Data analysis was mainly achieved by R 4.0.3.
RESULTS: The expression of LIPG in LUAD tissues was higher than that in adjacent 
normal tissues, especially in women, patients aged >65 years, and those with 
lymph node metastasis. High expression predicted a poor prognosis. The results 
of enrichment analysis suggest that LIPG may exert profound effects on the 
development of LUAD through multiple stages of lipid metabolism and immune 
system regulation. In addition, LIPG expression was significantly correlated 
with the expression levels of multiple immune checkpoint genes and the abundance 
of multiple immune infiltrates, including the activated memory CD4 T cell, M1 
macrophage, neutrophil, plasma cells, and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in the 
LUAD microenvironment content. At the same time, patients with high LIPG 
expression respond well to a variety of antitumor drugs and have a low rate of 
drug resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: LIPG is a prognostic marker and is associated with lipid metabolism 
and immune infiltration in LUAD."
583,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic process altered in cancer and ageing. 
Age-related methylation drift can be used to estimate lifespan and can be 
influenced by extrinsic factors such as diet. Here, we report that 
non-pathogenic microbiota accelerate age-related methylation drift in the colon 
when compared with germ-free mice. DNA methylation analyses showed that 
microbiota and IL10KO were associated with changes in 5% and 4.1% of CpG sites, 
while mice with both factors had 18% alterations. Microbiota, IL10KO, and their 
combination altered 0.4%, 0.4%, and 4% of CpG island methylation, respectively. 
These are comparable to what is seen in colon cancer. Ageing changes were 
accelerated in the IL10KO mice with microbiota, and the affected genes were more 
likely to be altered in colon cancer. Thus, the microbiota affect DNA 
methylation of the colon in patterns reminiscent of what is observed in ageing 
and colorectal cancer."
584,"INTRODUCTION: Tamoxifen is widely used for the treatment of hormone-responsive 
breast cancer. In this article, we report a case of a patient who developed hand 
deformities following long-term administration of tamoxifen.
CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old woman, followed for invasive ductal carcinoma of the 
left breast under tamoxifen for 7 years, presenting joint pain with deformities 
in her fingers.
MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Following the appearance of the adverse effect, tamoxifen 
was stopped. A series of biologic and radiologic analysis were performed in 
order to explain the appearance of this event. A substitution treatment was 
discussed and a rheumatologist's opinion was requested.
DISCUSSION: Tamoxifen appears to be associated with the development of 
inflammatory osteoarthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis. Possible mechanisms 
of such an effect are discussed."
585,"OBJECTIVE: The healthcare workers and the workers in the manufacturing industry 
of chemotherapy drugs are exposed to the ""hazardous"" effects of these drugs 
during production, transportation, distribution, administration, and disposal. 
In order to be protected from these harmful effects, personal protective 
equipment and medical devices providing safe applications are used. The aim of 
the present article is to review of medical devices used for safe chemotherapy 
applications in line with the information obtained from the literature.
DATA SOURCES: The international and national reliable sources, were used in the 
literature review for data analysis by using the keywords including 
chemotherapy, chemotherapy drugs, antineoplastic drugs, cytotoxic drugs, 
hazardous drugs, exposure to chemotherapy drugs, side effects of chemotherapy 
drugs, closed-system drug transfer devices, healthcare staff, needle-free 
devices, needle-free connectors, surface contamination, and phthalates.
DATA SUMMARY: In order to minimize cytotoxic drug exposure, international 
standards were developed in the mid-1980s stating that all cytotoxic drugs 
should be prepared preferably in a ventilated biological safety cabinet, nurses 
dealing with the use of these drugs should use appropriate personal protective 
equipment, and in case of cytotoxic drug spillage, predefined cleaning and 
decontamination protocols should be followed. Although the risk of acute and 
long-term toxic effects in healthcare workers has decreased in recent years with 
these applications in the preparation and administration of cancer drugs, 
measurable contamination occurs in the workplace. A large number of medical 
devices have been developed for minimizing this type of contamination with 
chemotherapy drugs. In this article, these medical devices have been reviewed in 
detail under subtitles of closed system transfer devices, needle-free devices, 
and valve technology.
CONCLUSIONS: Until the results of the evaluations to be made in new studies 
prove the opposite, the use of these devices with additional protection measures 
taken, especially during the application of dangerous drugs, is of great 
importance in terms of patient and employee safety."
586,"OBJECTIVE: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are new targeted therapies used to 
treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) due to RET gene 
rearrangements. The objective of this article is to review selpercatinib and 
pralsetinib in the context of RET-fusion-positive NSCLC.
DATA SOURCES: The pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials were evaluated regarding 
the use of selpercatinib and pralsetinib as treatment for RET-fusion-positive 
NSCLC. Comparative studies, review articles and current studies on selpercatinib 
and pralsetinib in RET-fusion-positive NSCLC were searched on pubmed.org and 
scholar.google.com using ""selpercatinib,"" ""pralsetinib,"" and ""NSCLC"" as 
keywords. Product monographs were searched on google.ca and uptodate.com using 
the keywords ""selpercatinib,"" ""pralsetinib,"" and/or ""monograph.""
DATA SUMMARY: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are orally administered highly 
selective RET inhibitors approved by the FDA following the accelerated approvals 
granted due to the pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials which evaluated 
selpercatinib and pralsetinib, respectively. Both drugs have shown efficacy for 
brain metastases and are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 through hepatic 
metabolism. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse effects of selpercatinib were 
hypertension, increased ALT level, and increased AST level while for 
pralsetinib, it was neutropenia, hypertension, and anemia. The safety profile 
shows similarities in severity and tolerability but additional monitoring for QT 
prolongation in patients on selpercatinib is recommended, compared to the risks 
of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis for patients on pralsetinib.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the increased use of selpercatinib and pralsetinib has led 
to the implementation of these drugs in the clinical practice of healthcare 
professionals such as pharmacists."
587,"BACKGROUND: Cyclin E1 (CCNE1) is a potential predictive marker and therapeutic 
target in tubo-ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). Smaller studies have 
revealed unfavorable associations for CCNE1 amplification and CCNE1 
overexpression with survival, but to date no large-scale, histotype-specific 
validation has been performed. The hypothesis was that high-level amplification 
of CCNE1 and CCNE1 overexpression, as well as a combination of the two, are 
linked to shorter overall survival in HGSC.
METHODS: Within the Ovarian Tumor Tissue Analysis consortium, amplification 
status and protein level in 3029 HGSC cases and mRNA expression in 2419 samples 
were investigated.
RESULTS: High-level amplification (>8 copies by chromogenic in situ 
hybridization) was found in 8.6% of HGSC and overexpression (>60% with at least 
5% demonstrating strong intensity by immunohistochemistry) was found in 22.4%. 
CCNE1 high-level amplification and overexpression both were linked to shorter 
overall survival in multivariate survival analysis adjusted for age and stage, 
with hazard stratification by study (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.08-1.47, 
p = .034, and HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.32, p = .015, respectively). This was 
also true for cases with combined high-level amplification/overexpression 
(HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47, p = .033). CCNE1 mRNA expression was not 
associated with overall survival (HR, 1.00 per 1-SD increase; 95% CI, 0.94-1.06; 
p = .58). CCNE1 high-level amplification is mutually exclusive with the presence 
of germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants and shows an inverse association to RB1 
loss.
CONCLUSION: This study provides large-scale validation that CCNE1 high-level 
amplification is associated with shorter survival, supporting its utility as a 
prognostic biomarker in HGSC."
588,"PURPOSE: To investigate the potential value of MRI radiomics obtained from a 1.5 
T MRI-guided linear accelerator (MR-LINAC) for D'Amico high-risk prostate cancer 
(PC) classification in MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT).
METHODS: One hundred seventy-six consecutive PC patients underwent 1.5 T MRgRT 
treatment were retrospectively enrolled. Each patient received one or two 
pretreatment T2 -weighted MRI scans on a 1.5 T MR-LINAC. The endpoint was to 
differentiate high-risk from low/intermediate-risk PC based on D'Amico criteria 
using MRI-radiomics. Totally 1023 features were extracted from clinical target 
volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV). Intraclass correlation 
coefficient of scan-rescan repeatability, feature correlation, and recursive 
feature elimination were used for feature dimension reduction. Least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator regression was employed for model construction. 
Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) analysis was used 
for model performance assessment in both training and testing data.
RESULTS: One hundred and eleven patients fulfilled all criteria were finally 
included: 76 for training and 35 for testing. The constructed MRI-radiomics 
models extracted from CTV and PTV achieved the AUC of 0.812 and 0.867 in the 
training data, without significant difference (P = 0.083). The model 
performances remained in the testing. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy 
were 85.71%, 64.29%, and 77.14% for the PTV-based model; and 71.43%, 71.43%, and 
71.43% for the CTV-based model. The corresponding AUCs were 0.718 and 0.750 
(P = 0.091) for CTV- and PTV-based models.
CONCLUSION: MRI-radiomics obtained from a 1.5 T MR-LINAC showed promising 
results in D'Amico high-risk PC stratification, potentially helpful for the 
future PC MRgRT. Prospective studies with larger sample sizes and external 
validation are warranted for further verification."
589,"BACKGROUND: Reports of cerebrovascular ischemia and stroke occurring as 
predominant neurological sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19), are increasingly evident within the literature. While various 
pathophysiological mechanisms have been postulated, including 
hypercoagulability, endothelial invasion, and systemic inflammation, discrete 
mechanisms for viral neurotropism remain unclear and controversial.
OBSERVATIONS: The authors present a unique case study of a 64-year-old male with 
acute COVID-19 infection and acute worsening of previously stable cerebral 
autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a rare heritable arteriopathy due to mutation in 
the Notch3 gene, which is critical for vascular development and tone. Delayed 
cranial neuropathies, brainstem fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal, and 
enhancement of olfactory and vagus nerves on magnetic resonance neurography in 
this patient further support viral neurotropism via cranial nerves in addition 
to cerebral vasculature.
LESSONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case in the literature 
that not only demonstrates the consequences of COVID-19 infection in a patient 
with altered cerebrovascular autoregulation such as CADASIL but also highlights 
the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for (1) cranial nerves as a mode of entry to the 
central nervous system and (2) vessels as a cause of cerebrovascular ischemia."
590,"PURPOSE: To develop a robust processing procedure of raw signals from 
water-unsuppressed MRSI of the prostate for the mapping of absolute tissue 
concentrations of metabolites.
METHODS: Water-unsuppressed 3D MRSI data were acquired from a phantom, from 
healthy volunteers, and a patient with prostate cancer. Signal processing 
included sequential computation of the modulus of the FID to remove water 
sidebands, a Hilbert transformation, and k-space Hamming filtering. For the 
removal of the water signal, we compared Löwner tensor-based blind source 
separation (BSS) and Hankel Lanczos singular value decomposition techniques. 
Absolute metabolite levels were quantified with LCModel and the results were 
statistically analyzed to compare the water removal methods and conventional 
water-suppressed MRSI.
RESULTS: The post-processing algorithms successfully removed the water signal 
and its sidebands without affecting metabolite signals. The best water removal 
performance was achieved by Löwner tensor-based BSS. Absolute tissue 
concentrations of citrate in the peripheral zone derived from water-suppressed 
and unsuppressed 1 H MRSI were the same and as expected from the known 
physiology of the healthy prostate. Maps for citrate and choline from 
water-unsuppressed 3D 1 H-MRSI of the prostate showed expected spatial 
variations in metabolite levels.
CONCLUSION: We developed a robust relatively simple post-processing method of 
water-unsuppressed MRSI of the prostate to remove the water signal. Absolute 
quantification using the water signal, originating from the same location as the 
metabolite signals, avoids the acquisition of additional reference data."
591,"Adrenal cortical cancer has a relatively low incidence, but a dismal 5-year 
survival rate. Surgical intervention is the gold standard of care today. In 
spite of this progress, patients continue to have a dismal outlook. The results 
of this study demonstrate that kinin superfamily (KIF) has strong ties to many 
different types of cancers. However, their prognostic and immune cell 
infiltration of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) remain unclear. Multiple 
databases were searched for information on the transcription level of KIFs, its 
correlation with clinical data of ACC patients, patients' overall survival (OS), 
first progression survival (FPS), and progression free interval (PFI). Its role 
and association with immune cells were also investigated. We observed an 
increase in the expression of KIF4A, KIF11, KIF20A, and KIF22. There was a 
strong correlation between them and the advancedness of ACC tumors. Parallel to 
this, KIFs are connected to the concepts of operating systems, distributed file 
systems, and partitioned file systems. Similarly, we found five key genes, PRC1, 
PLK1, KIF23, KIFC1, and KIF5A, through data analysis, all of which participate 
in multiple cellular pathways. Both KIF4A and KIF11 expression levels were 
marginally positively correlated with immune infiltration. Because KIF4A, KIF11, 
KIF20A, and KIF22 are involved in multiple ACC processes and can influence the 
onset and progression of ACC, they provide a mechanistically grounded framework 
for diagnosing and managing the disease."
592,"Histone acetylation is a post-translational modification of histones that is 
catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and plays an essential role in 
cellular processes. The HAT domain of EP300/CBP has recently emerged as a 
potential drug target for cancer therapy. Here, we describe the identification 
of the novel, highly potent, and selective EP300/CBP HAT inhibitor DS-9300. Our 
optimization efforts using a structure-based drug design approach based on the 
cocrystal structures of the EP300 HAT domain in complex with compounds 2 and 3 
led to the identification of compounds possessing low-nanomolar EP300 HAT 
inhibitory potency and the ability to inhibit cellular acetylation of histone 
H3K27. Optimization of the pharmacokinetic properties in this series resulted in 
compounds with excellent oral systemic exposure, and once-daily oral 
administration of 16 (DS-9300) demonstrated potent antitumor effects in a 
castrated VCaP xenograft mouse model without significant body weight loss."
593,"Metalloproteinases cleave transmembrane proteins that play critical roles in 
inflammation and cancers. Metalloproteinases include a disintegrin and 
metalloprotease (ADAM), which we previously examined using a fluorescence assay 
system, and described their association with resistance to systemic therapy in 
cancer patients. There are also many reports on the relation between ADAM 
expression and the prognosis of patients with gastroenterological chronic 
inflammatory diseases and cancers. Inhibiting their immunomodulating activity in 
chronic inflammation restores innate immunity and potentially prevents the 
development of various cancers. Among the numerous critical immune 
system-related molecules, we focus on major histocompatibility complex class I 
polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA), MICB, intracellular adhesion molecule 
(ICAM)-1, TNF-α, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), and Notch. This review summarizes our 
current understanding of the role of ADAMs in gastroenterological diseases with 
regard to the immune system. Several Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 
inhibitors of ADAMs have been identified, and potential therapies for targeting 
ADAMs in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and cancers are 
discussed. Some ongoing clinical trials for cancers targeting ADAMs are also 
introduced."
594,"Complex karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (CK-AML) has been classified as an 
adverse-risk subtype. Although a few reports have further classified CK-AML as 
typical (including monosomy of chromosomes 5, 7 and 17 or deletion of 5q, 7q 
and/or 17p) or atypical, the clinical features of these subtypes in Japanese 
patients remain unclear. We retrospectively analyzed a total of 115 patients 
with CK-AML, including 77 with typical CK-AML and 38 with atypical CK-AML. 
Median overall survival (OS) was significantly shorter in patients with typical 
CK-AML than atypical CK-AML (143 days vs. 369 days, P = 0.009). Among patients 
with typical CK-AML, those with monosomy 17 or deletion of 17p had significantly 
shorter OS than patients without such abnormalities (105 days vs. 165 days, 
P = 0.033). TP53 mutations were more predominant in patients with typical CK-AML 
than in patients with atypical CK-AML (69.7% vs. 32.4%, P < 0.001). Patients 
with typical CK-AML had a poor prognosis regardless of TP53 mutation status. 
Among patients with atypical CK-AML, however, prognosis was worse for those with 
the TP53 mutation than those without the mutation. In conclusion, prognosis is 
extremely poor for both typical CK-AML and atypical CK-AML with TP53 mutation."
595,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the survival impacts of pretreatment cancerous 
stenosis on patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC).
METHODS: The clinicopathologic characteristics of patients who underwent surgery 
for EC between January 2010 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. 
Esophageal stenosis was defined as present when a thin endoscope could not be 
passed through the tumor site. The impacts of stenosis on overall survival (OS) 
and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were evaluated using Cox hazards analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 496 EC patients in this study, 51 (10.3 %) had pretreatment 
esophageal stenosis. Stenosis was associated with lower body mass index (P < 
0.001) and higher pStage (P < 0.001). The 3-year OS rate for the patients with 
stenosis was significantly poorer than for the patients without stenosis (40.2 % 
vs 69.6 %; hazard ratio [HR], 2.19; P < 0.001). The survival outcomes, 
especially CSS, for the patients with stenosis were significantly poorer than 
for the patients without stenosis for both pStage II-III (P = 0.009) and pStage 
IV (P = 0.006) disease. The OS and CSS curves were well stratified by the 
presence of stenosis even in early-stage (pStage II) patients (P = 0.04 and P < 
0.01, respectively). Multivariable analysis showed esophageal stenosis, pStage 
III-IV disease, and non-curative resection to be independently associated with 
poor OS (HR, 1.61; P = 0.02) and poor CSS (HR,1.67; P = 0.02). Higher pStage was 
an independent predictor of poor CSS for patients without stenosis, but not for 
those with stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Esophageal carcinoma patients with pretreatment stenosis had 
significantly poorer survival outcomes, especially poorer CSS, than those 
without stenosis in both early- and advanced-stage diseases."
596,"BACKGROUND: Performing selective esophagectomy for locally advanced squamous 
cell carcinoma may spare patients morbidity, but delayed surgery may infer 
higher risks. This study evaluated the impact of length of time between 
chemoradiation and esophagectomy on perioperative outcomes and long-term 
survival.
METHODS: The impact of surgical timing, stratified by surgery performed < 180 
and ≥ 180 days from starting radiation, on perioperative outcomes and survival 
in patients treated with chemoradiation and esophagectomy for cT1N + M0 and 
cT2-4, any N, M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the mid-distal esophagus in the 
National Cancer Database (2006-2016) was evaluated with logistic regression, 
Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional-hazards methods, and propensity-matched 
analysis.
RESULTS: Median time between starting radiation and esophagectomy in 1641 
patients was 93 (IQR 81-114) days. Most patients (96.8%, n = 1589) had surgery 
within 180 days of starting radiation, while 52 patients (3.2%) had delayed 
surgery. Black race and clinical T stage were associated with delayed surgery. 
Rates of pathologic upstaging, downstaging, complete response, and positive 
margins were not significantly different between the groups. Patients with 
delayed surgery had increased major morbidity as measured by a composite of 
length of hospital stay, readmission, and 30-day mortality [42.3% (22/52) vs 
22.3% (355/1589), p = 0.001]. However, delayed surgery was not associated with a 
significant difference in survival in both univariate [5-year survival 32.8% 
(95% CI 21.1-50.7) vs 47.3% (44.7-50.1), p = 0.19] and multivariable analysis 
[hazard ratio (HR) 1.23 (0.85-1.78), p = 0.26].
CONCLUSIONS: Delaying surgery longer than 180 days after starting chemoradiation 
for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is associated with worse perioperative 
outcomes but not long-term survival."
597,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer surgery outcomes benefit from higher hospital 
volumes. Despite the evidence, organization of national health care often is 
complex and depends on various factors. The volume-outcome results of this 
population-based study supported national health policy measures regarding 
concentration of esophageal resections in Belgium.
METHODS: The Belgian Cancer Registry (BCR) database was linked to administrative 
data on cancer treatment. All Belgian patients with newly diagnosed esophageal 
cancer in 2008-2018 undergoing resection were allocated to the hospital at which 
surgery was performed. The study assessed hospital volume association with 
90-day mortality and 5-year overall survival, classifying average annual 
hospital volume of resections as low (LV, <6), medium (MV, 6-19), or high (HV, 
≥20) and as a continuous covariate in the regression models.
RESULTS: The study included 4156 patients who had surgery in 79 hospitals (2 HV 
hospitals [37% of all surgeries], 12 MV hospitals [30% of all surgeries], and 65 
LV hospitals [33% of all surgeries]). Adjusted 90-day mortality in HV hospitals 
was lower than in LV hospitals (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21-0.65; p = 
0.001). Case-mix adjusted 5-year survival was superior in HV versus LV (hazard 
ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.31-0.60; p < 0.001). The continuous model 
demonstrated a lower 90-day mortality (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.23-0.71; p = 0.002) 
and a superior 5-year survival (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.33-0.63; p < 0.001) in 
hospitals with volumes of 40 or more resections annually.
CONCLUSION: Population-based data from the BCR confirmed a strong volume-outcome 
association for esophageal resections. Improved 5-year survival in centers with 
annual volumes of 20 or more resections was driven mainly by the achievement of 
superior 90-day mortality. These findings supported centralization of esophageal 
resections in Belgium."
598,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer with a 
significant impact on loss of life. In 2020, nearly 1.9 million new cases and 
over 9,35,000 deaths were reported. Numerous microbes that are abundant in the 
human gut benefit host physiology in many ways. Although the underlying 
mechanism is still unknown, their association appears to be crucial in the 
beginning and progression of CRC. Diet has a significant impact on the microbial 
composition and may increase the chance of getting CRC. Increasing evidence 
points to the gut microbiota as the primary initiator of colonic inflammation, 
which is connected to the development of colonic tumors. However, it is unclear 
how the microbiota contributes to the development of CRCs. Patients with CRC 
have been found to have dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, which can be identified 
by a decline in commensal bacterial species, such as those that produce 
butyrate, and a concurrent increase in harmful bacterial populations, such as 
opportunistic pathogens that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. We believe that 
using probiotics or altering the gut microbiota will likely be effective tools 
in the fight against CRC treatment.
PURPOSE: In this review, we revisited the association between gut microbiota and 
colorectal cancer whether cause or effect. The various factors which influence 
gut microbiome in patients with CRC and possible mechanism in relation with 
development of CRC.
CONCLUSION: The clinical significance of the intestinal microbiota may aid in 
the prevention and management of CRC."
599,"PURPOSE: SHC014748M is a potent, novel selective PI3Kδ isoform inhibitor and is 
proposed for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. This study investigated the 
pharmacokinetics, mass balance, metabolism and excretion of SHC014748M in 
Chinese male subjects following a single oral dose of 150 mg (100 μCi) [14C] 
SHC014748M.
METHODS: Six healthy Chinese male subjects administrated an oral suspension of 
150 mg (100 μCi) [14C] SHC014748M and the samples of blood, urine and feces were 
collected for measuring. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and 
liquid scintillation counter were utilized to obtain mass balance and the 
pharmacokinetic data.
RESULTS: The median Tmax for [14C]-radioactivity was 1.6 ± 0.5 h after the oral 
administration of [14C] SHC014748M and the mean Cmax was 3863 ± 354 ng Eq./mL in 
plasma, while the mean Cmax, t1/2 values and AUC0-∞ values for total 
radioactivity in whole blood were 2466 ± 518 ng Eq./mL, 32.2 ± 30.5 h and 
66,236 ± 44,232 h * ng Eq./mL, respectively. Fecal excretion was proposed as the 
predominant elimination route, accounting for a mean of 90.68 ± 11.38% of the 
administered dose, whereas the mean urine excretion was 6.00 ± 1.48% within 
336 h post-dose. The proposed major metabolic pathway of [14C] SHC014748M in the 
human body were as follows: (I) monooxidation, (II) glucuronide acid 
conjugation, and (III) monoxide-hydrogenation.
CONCLUSIONS: SHC014748M was absorbed, metabolized and excreted with unchanged 
SHC014748M as its main circulating component in plasma following oral 
administration. In addition, it was speculated that fecal excretion was the 
principal excretion pathway; meanwhile, monohydroxy, glucuronide conjugation,

600,"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that 
even at very low levels can cause cancer by increasing the activity of tumor 
cells and suppressing the immune system. There is also little information on 
OCPs and survival after diagnosis. The aim of this study was to monitor the 
concentration of OCPs in the blood serum of cancer patients and its relationship 
with their socio-demographic characteristics and ultimately that impact on 
survival time and hazard ratio (HR). This cross-sectional study included 89 
diagnosed patients with cancer in Isfahan, Iran. 12 types of OCPs were measured 
in serum by gas chromatography (7GC) with an electron capture detector and 
equipped with mass spectrometer (MS). Also, participants' questionnaire was 
completed to collect information. T-test, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests were used 
to evaluate the association between serum levels of OCPs and quantitative and 
qualitative information of patients. Survival analysis was also examined based 
on Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox model. The mean of total OCPs in 
patients' serum was calculated to be 1.82 ± 1.36 μg/L. Concentration of 2,4' DDE 
had a significant relationship with body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) (P < 0.05). In 
addition, gender revealed a significant correlation in estimating survival time 
(P < 0.05). Non-exposure to OCPs showed a positive effect on increasing the life 
expectancy of patients. Lindane and endosulfan increased the risk of death by 
16% and 37%, respectively, with insignificant P value (P > 0.05). The findings 
of the present study showed adverse effects of OCPs on patients' survival time 
and increased mortality of HR. Moreover, as the first research conducted in the 
study area, it is suggested management of environmental, individual and social 
factors that could be influenced the biological accumulation of OCPs in humans 
and cause health promotion."
601,"In this paper, a novel electrochemical sensor was constructed for the detection 
of purine bases. Ultrafine carbide nanocrystals confined within porous 
nitrogen-doped carbon dodecahedrons (PNCD) were synthesized by adding molybdate 
to ZIF-8 followed by annealing. With MoC-based PNCDs (MC-PNCDs) as the carrier, 
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were deposited on the electrode surface via 
potentiostatic deposition as the promoter of electron transfer, forming a 
AuNPs/MC-PNCDs/activated glassy carbon electrode (AGCE) sensor. MC-PNCDs had a 
large specific surface area, which combined with the excellent electrocatalytic 
activity of AuNPs, synergistically improved the electrocatalytic activity. The 
morphology and structure of the electrode surface modifier were characterized by 
scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, 
energy-dispersive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray 
diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis, and electrochemical 
characterization. Under the optimal conditions, the linear detection range of 
guanine (G) and adenine (A) was 0.5-160.0 μM, and the detection limits (S/N=3) 
were 72.1 and 69.6 nM, respectively. AuNPs/MC-PNCDs/AGCE was successfully 
constructed, and was used to simultaneously detect G and A with high sensitivity 
and selectivity. Moreover, the sensor was successfully used to detect G and A in 
herring sperm DNA samples."
602,"Despite improvement of current treatment strategies and novel targeted drugs, 
relapse and treatment resistance largely determine the outcome for acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) patients. To identify the underlying molecular characteristics, 
numerous studies have been aimed to decipher the genomic- and transcriptomic 
landscape of AML. Nevertheless, further molecular changes allowing malignant 
cells to escape treatment remain to be elucidated. Mass spectrometry is a 
powerful tool enabling detailed insights into proteomic changes that could 
explain AML relapse and resistance. Here, we investigated AML samples from 47 
adult and 22 pediatric patients at serial time-points during disease progression 
using mass spectrometry-based in-depth proteomics. We show that the proteomic 
profile at relapse is enriched for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and subunits 
of the respiratory chain complex, indicative of reprogrammed energy metabolism 
from diagnosis to relapse. Further, higher levels of granzymes and lower levels 
of the anti-inflammatory protein CR1/CD35 suggest an inflammatory signature 
promoting disease progression. Finally, through a proteogenomic approach, we 
detected novel peptides, which present a promising repertoire in the search for 
biomarkers and tumor-specific druggable targets. Altogether, this study 
highlights the importance of proteomic studies in holistic approaches to improve 
treatment and survival of AML patients."
603,"Nuclear factor I-C (NFIC) belongs to a family of NFI transcription factors that 
binds to DNA through CAATT-boxes and are involved in cellular differentiation 
and stem cell maintenance. Here we show NFIC protein is significantly 
overexpressed in 69% of acute myeloid leukemia patients. Examination of the 
functional consequences of NFIC overexpression in HSPCs showed that this protein 
promoted monocytic differentiation. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis further 
demonstrated that NFIC overexpressing monocytes had increased expression of 
growth and survival genes. In contrast, depletion of NFIC through shRNA 
decreased cell growth, increased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in AML cell 
lines and AML patient blasts. Further, in AML cell lines (THP-1), bulk RNA 
sequencing of NFIC knockdown led to downregulation of genes involved in cell 
survival and oncogenic signaling pathways including mixed lineage leukemia-1 
(MLL-1). Lastly, we show that NFIC knockdown in an ex vivo mouse MLL::AF9 
pre-leukemic stem cell model, decreased their growth and colony formation and 
increased expression of myeloid differentiation markers Gr1 and Mac1. 
Collectively, our results suggest that NFIC is an important transcription factor 
in myeloid differentiation as well as AML cell survival and is a potential 
therapeutic target in AML."
604,"BACKGROUND: Recently, molecular tumour boards (MTBs) have been integrated into 
the clinical routine. Since their benefit remains debated, we assessed MTB 
outcomes in the Comprehensive Cancer Center Ostbayern (CCCO) from 2019 to 2021.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 251 patients were included. Targeted sequencing 
was performed with PCR MSI-evaluation and immunohistochemistry for PD-L1, Her2, 
and mismatch repair enzymes. 125 treatment recommendations were given (49.8%). 
High-recommendation rates were achieved for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
(20/30, 66.7%) and gastric adenocarcinoma (10/16, 62.5%) as opposed to 
colorectal cancer (9/36, 25.0%) and pancreatic cancer (3/18, 16.7%). MTB 
therapies were administered in 47 (18.7%) patients, while 53 (21.1%) received 
alternative treatment regimens. Thus 37.6% of recommended MTB therapies were 
implemented (47/125 recommendations). The clinical benefit rate 
(complete + partial + mixed response + stable disease) was 50.0% for MTB and 
63.8% for alternative treatments. PFS2/1 ratios were 34.6% and 16.1%, 
respectively. Significantly improved PFS could be achieved for 
m1A-tier-evidence-based MTB therapies (median 6.30 months) compared to 
alternative treatments (median 2.83 months; P = 0.0278).
CONCLUSION: The CCCO MTB yielded a considerable recommendation rate, 
particularly in cholangiocarcinoma patients. The discrepancy between the 
low-recommendation rates in colorectal and pancreatic cancer suggests the 
necessity of a weighted prioritisation of entities. High-tier recommendations 
should be implemented predominantly."
605,"BACKGROUND: Targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from FFPE specimens is used 
clinically in cancer for its ability to estimate gene expression and to detect 
fusions. Using a cohort of NSCLC patients, we sought to determine whether 
targeted RNA-seq could be used to measure tumour mutational burden (TMB) and the 
expression of immune-cell-restricted genes from FFPE specimens and whether these 
could predict response to immune checkpoint blockade.
METHODS: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas LUAD dataset, we developed a method for 
determining TMB from tumour-only RNA-seq and showed a correlation with DNA 
sequencing derived TMB calculated from tumour/normal sample pairs (Spearman 
correlation = 0.79, 95% CI [0.73, 0.83]. We applied this method to targeted 
sequencing data from our patient cohort and validated these results against TMB 
estimates obtained using an orthogonal assay (Spearman correlation = 0.49, 95% 
CI [0.24, 0.68]).
RESULTS: We observed that the RNA measure of TMB was significantly higher in 
responders to immune blockade treatment (P = 0.028) and that it was predictive 
of response (AUC = 0.640 with 95% CI [0.493, 0.786]). By contrast, the 
expression of immune-cell-restricted genes was uncorrelated with patient 
outcome.
CONCLUSION: TMB calculated from targeted RNA sequencing has a similar diagnostic 
ability to TMB generated from targeted DNA sequencing."
606,"BACKGROUND: The TGF-β1 transcription factor SMAD3 is epigenetically repressed in 
tumour-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) from lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) but 
not adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients, which elicits a compensatory increase in 
SMAD2 that renders SCC-TAFs less fibrotic. Here we examined the effects of 
altered SMAD2/3 in fibroblast migration and its impact on the desmoplastic 
stroma formation in lung cancer.
METHODS: We used a microfluidic device to examine descriptors of early 
protrusions and subsequent migration in 3D collagen gels upon knocking down 
SMAD2 or SMAD3 by shRNA in control fibroblasts and TAFs.
RESULTS: High SMAD3 conditions as in shSMAD2 fibroblasts and ADC-TAFs exhibited 
a migratory advantage in terms of protrusions (fewer and longer) and migration 
(faster and more directional) selectively without TGF-β1 along with Erk1/2 
hyperactivation. This enhanced migration was abrogated by TGF-β1 as well as low 
glucose medium and the MEK inhibitor Trametinib. In contrast, high SMAD2 
fibroblasts were poorly responsive to TGF-β1, high glucose and Trametinib, 
exhibiting impaired migration in all conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: The basal migration advantage of high SMAD3 fibroblasts provides a 
straightforward mechanism underlying the larger accumulation of TAFs previously 
reported in ADC compared to SCC. Moreover, our results encourage using MEK 
inhibitors in ADC-TAFs but not SCC-TAFs."
607,"AIM: To evaluate the real-world usage pattern and factors associated with the 
effectiveness of regorafenib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC).
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data for 209 patients with mCRC 
treated with regorafenib as third or later line of therapy. TheKaplan-Meier 
method was used to draw the survival curves. Cox proportional hazard regression 
models were used to analyze the prognostic value for overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Of 209 patients, 156 (75%) were treated with regorafenib, and 53 (25%) 
were given regorafenib combined with programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors. 
About 182 (87%) patients had a dose record of regorafenib. The initial daily 
doses of regorafenib were 160, 120, 80, and 40 mg, accounting for 29%, 17%, 48%, 
and 6% of patients, respectively. The median follow-up time was 11.3 months, and 
the median OS was 12.0 months (95% CI: 9.7-14.3). Patients treated with PD-1 
inhibitors plus regorafenib had a longer OS than the non-PD-1 group (13.5 vs. 
10.1 months, hazard ratio [HR] = .534, 95% CI: .325-.879; p = .014). A total of 
49 patients with microsatellite stable or mismatch repair-proficient genotype 
treated with PD-1 inhibitors plus regorafenib had a longer OS than the non-PD-1 
group (13.5 vs. 9.7 months; HR = .563, p = .027). The median OS of patients 
continuing treatment with regorafenib after progression (n = 19, with five 
patients receiving additional immunotherapy) was marginally longer than patients 
discontinuing regorafenib after progression (12.7 vs. 11.9 months, p = .425) 
observed in a smaller cohort.
CONCLUSION: In real-world practice, patients with mCRC in whom standard regimens 
had failed have a good survival benefit with regorafenib. Combination with PD-1 
inhibitor may further prolong survival of the patients."
608,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) show high efficiency in a small fraction of 
advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, personalized immune subtypes have not 
been developed for the prediction of ICI efficiency in GC. Herein, we identified 
Pan-Immune Activation Module (PIAM), a curated gene expression profile (GEP) 
representing the co-infiltration of multiple immune cell types in tumor 
microenvironment of GC, which was associated with high expression of 
immunosuppressive molecules such as PD-1 and CTLA-4. We also identified 
Pan-Immune Dysfunction Genes (PIDG), a conservative PIAM-derivated GEP 
indicating the dysfunction of immune cell cooperation, which was associated with 
upregulation of metastatic programs (extracellular matrix receptor interaction, 
TGF-β signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and calcium signaling) but 
downregulation of proliferative signalings (MYC targets, E2F targets, mTORC1 
signaling, and DNA replication and repair). Moreover, we developed 
'GSClassifier', an ensemble toolkit based on top scoring pairs and extreme 
gradient boosting, for population-based modeling and personalized identification 
of GEP subtypes. With PIAM and PIDG, we developed four Pan-immune Activation and 
Dysfunction (PAD) subtypes and a GSClassifier model 'PAD for individual' with 
high accuracy in predicting response to pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in advance GC 
(AUC = 0.833). Intriguingly, PAD-II (PIAMhighPIDGlow) displayed the highest 
objective response rate (60.0%) compared with other subtypes (PAD-I, 
PIAMhighPIDGhigh, 0%; PAD-III, PIAMlowPIDGhigh, 0%; PAD-IV, PIAMlowPIDGlow, 
17.6%; P = 0.003), which was further validated in the metastatic urothelial 
cancer cohort treated with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) (P = 0.018). In all, we 
provided 'GSClassifier' as a refined computational framework for GEP-based 
stratification and PAD subtypes as a promising strategy for exploring ICI 
responders in GC. Metastatic pathways could be potential targets for GC patients 
with high immune infiltration but resistance to ICI therapy."
609,"Glioma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults with high 
morbidity and mortality. Rapid proliferation and diffuse migration are the main 
obstacles to successful glioma treatment. Xanthatin, a sesquiterpene lactone 
purified from Xanthium strumarium L., possesses a significant antitumor role in 
several malignant tumors. In this study, we report that xanthatin suppressed 
glioma cells proliferation and induced apoptosis in a time- and 
concentration-dependent manner, and was accompanied by autophagy inhibition 
displaying a significantly reduced LC3 punctate fluorescence and LC3II/I ratio, 
decreased level of Beclin 1, while increased accumulation of p62. Notably, 
treating glioma cells with xanthatin resulted in obvious activation of the 
PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, as indicated by increased mTOR and Akt 
phosphorylation, decreased ULK1 phosphorylation, which is important in 
modulating autophagy. Furthermore, xanthatin-mediated pro-apoptosis in glioma 
cells was significantly reversed by autophagy inducers (rapamycin or Torin1), or 
PI3K-mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235. Taken together, these findings indicate that 
anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effects of xanthatin in glioma are most 
likely by inhibiting autophagy via activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, 
suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy against glioma."
610,"Despite immunotherapy emerging as a vital approach to improve cancer treatment, 
the activation of efficient immune responses is still hampered by 
immunosuppression, especially due to the low tumor immunogenicity. Immunogenic 
cell death (ICD) is a promising strategy to reshape the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) for achieving high immunogenicity. Various stimuli are able to effectively 
initiate their specific ICD by utilizing the corresponding ICD-inducer. However, 
the ICD-guided antitumor immune effects are usually impaired by various 
biological barriers and TME-associated immune resistance. Biomimetic active 
materials are being extensively explored as guided agents for ICD due to their 
unique advantages. In this review, two major strategies are systematically 
introduced that have been employed to exploit biomimetic active materials guided 
ICD for cancer immunotherapy, mainly including naive organism-derived nanoagents 
and engineered bioactive platforms. This review outlines the recent advances in 
the field at biomimetic active materials guided physiotherapy, chemotherapy, and 
biotherapy for ICD induction. The advances and challenges of biomimetic active 
materials guided ICD for cancer immunotherapy applications are further discussed 
in future clinical practice. This review provides an overview of the advances of 
biomimetic active materials for targeting immunoregulation and treatment and can 
contribute to the future of advanced antitumor combination therapy."
611,"Synergistic photothermal immunotherapy has emerged as a favorable therapeutic 
approach to fight cancer. However, design of an effective photothermal 
immunotherapy system to suppress tumor growth and simultaneously inhibit tumor 
metastases continues to be a challenge. Here a dual toll-like receptor agonists 
delivery system CPG@Au NRs/m-R848 for combined photothermal immunotherapy of 
melanoma is developed. CPG@Au NRs/m-R848 displays strong antitumor effects by 
promoting maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and reprogramming of M2 
macrophages into M1 phenotype. Moreover, immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by 
photothermal ablation of Au NRs could synergistically produce in situ 
vaccination effect with CPG ODN and R848, generating systemic and lasting 
antitumor immunity. It is further proved that CPG@Au NRs/m-R848 treatment 
inhibits tumor growth in bilateral B16F10 tumors model by eliciting CD8+ T cell 
response. Overall, this work suggests that this strategy hold great potential in 
tumor immunotherapy by regulating tumor-associated macrophage polarization, 
triggering DCs maturation and inducing ICD."
612,"The synthesized 11 artemisinin-isatin hybrids 5a-c and 6a-h tethered via 
ethylene linker were assessed for their in vitro antiproliferative activity 
against A549 and H1299 nonsmall-cell lung cancer cell lines as well as their 
cytotoxicity towards BEAS-2B human normal lung epithelial cells. The preliminary 
results showed that hybrids 5a-c and 6a-h did not show any cytotoxicity (IC50 : 
>100 µM) on BEAS-2B cells, and also possessed potential activity (IC50 : 
6.99-76.49 µM) against A549 and H1299 lung cancer cell lines. The representative 
hybrid 6c (IC50 : 6.99 and 7.57 µM) was far more potent than artemisinin (IC50 : 
>100 µM) and dihydroartemisinin (IC50 : >100 µM), and was slightly less active 
than doxorubicin (IC50 : 4.14 and 2.77 µM). Moreover, hybrid 6c also exhibited 
an excellent safety profile and good selectivity with SI values of >13.21. 
Therefore, hybrid 6c could serve as a promising candidate for further in vivo 
evaluations."
613,"The detection of deep-seated lesions is of great significance for biomedical 
applications. However, due to the strong photon absorption and scattering of 
biological tissues, it is challenging to realize in vivo deep optical 
detections, particularly for those using the safe laser irradiance below 
clinical maximum permissible exposure (MPE). In this work, the combination of 
ultra-bright surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanotags and transmission 
Raman spectroscopy (TRS) is reported to achieve the non-invasive and photosafe 
detection of ""phantom"" lesions deeply hidden in biological tissues, under the 
guidance of theoretical calculations showing the importance of SERS nanotags' 
brightness and the expansion of laser beam size. Using a home-built TRS system 
with a laser power density of 0.264 W cm-2 (below the MPE 
criteria), we successfully demonstrated the detection of SERS nanotags through 
up to 14-cm-thick ex vivo porcine tissues, as well as in vivo imaging of 
""phantom"" lesions labeled by SERS nanotags in a 1.5-cm-thick unshaved mouse 
under MPE. This work highlights the potential of transmission Raman-guided 
identification and non-invasive imaging toward clinically photosafe cancer 
diagnoses."
614,"AIM: To determine the incidence of positive fluoroscopic oesophagography in 
patients presenting with spontaneous or blunt traumatic pneumomediastinum.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on patients who 
underwent fluoroscopic oesophagography for spontaneous or blunt traumatic 
pneumomediastinum between 2001-2019. Patients were excluded for history of 
oesophageal surgery, penetrating trauma, oesophageal cancer, or 
tracheal/oesophageal instrumentation.
RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-two patients met the inclusion criteria; 170 
presented with spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 82 presented with blunt 
traumatic pneumomediastinum. Fluoroscopic oesophagography was positive in eight 
patients with spontaneous pneumomediastinum, for a positivity rate of 4.7% 
(8/170). There was one false-negative case in a patient who presented with 
spontaneous pneumomediastinum and was found to have a non-full-thickness 
oesophageal injury on endoscopy. Fluoroscopic oesophagography was negative in 
all patients with blunt traumatic pneumomediastinum (0/82). The sensitivity and 
specificity of fluoroscopic oesophagography were 88.9% (8/9) and 100% (243/243), 
respectively. Oesophageal injury was more common in patients with spontaneous 
pneumomediastinum and a pleural effusion (5/11, 45.4%) than in patients with 
spontaneous pneumomediastinum and no pleural effusion (4/159, 2.5%, p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The present findings do not support routine oesophagography in 
patients with blunt traumatic pneumomediastinum. Conversely, a positivity rate 
of 4.7% in patients with spontaneous pneumomediastinum suggests oesophagography 
may be warranted in this population, particularly if an associated pleural 
effusion is present."
615,"INTRODUCTION: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the standard of care in inoperable 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, favoring concurrent (cCRT) over 
sequential CRT (seqCRT), with adjuvant immunotherapy in responders. Elderly and 
frail NSCLC patients have generally been excluded from trials in the past. In 
elderly patients however, the higher treatment related morbidity of cCRT, may 
outweigh the possible lower tumor control of seqCRT. For elderly patients with 
locally advanced NSCLC real-world data is essential to be able to balance 
treatment toxicity and treatment outcome. The aim of this study is to analyze 
acute toxicity and 3-month mortality of curative chemoradiation (CRT) in 
patients with stage III NSCLC and to analyze whether cCRT for elderly stage III 
NSCLC patients is safe.
METHODS: The Dutch Lung Cancer Audit-Radiotherapy (DLCA-R) is a national lung 
cancer audit that started in 2013 for patients treated with curative intent 
radiotherapy. All Dutch patients treated for stage III NSCLC between 2015 and 
2018 with seqCRT or cCRT for (primary or recurrent) stage III lung cancer are 
included in this population-based study. Information was collected on patient, 
tumor- and treatment characteristics and the incidence and severity of acute 
non-hematological toxicity (CTCAE-4 version 4.03) and mortality within 3 months 
after the end of radiotherapy. To evaluate the association between prognostic 
factors and outcome (acute toxicity and mortality within 3 months), an 
univariable and multivariable analysis was performed. The definition of cCRT 
was:radiotherapy started within 30 days after the start of chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Out of all 20 Dutch departments of radiation oncology, 19 centers 
participated in the registry. A total of 2942 NSCLC stage III patients were 
treated with CRT. Of these 67.2% (n = 1977) were treated with cCRT (median age 
66 years) and 32.8% (n = 965) were treated with seqCRT (median age 69 years). 
Good performance status (WHO 0-1) was scored in 88.6% for patients treated with 
cCRT and in 71.0% in the patients treated with seqCRT. Acute nonhematological 
3-month toxicity (CTCAE grade ≥3 or radiation pneumonitis grade ≥2) was scored 
in 21.9% of the patients treated with cCRT and in 17.7% of the patients treated 
with seqCRT. The univariable analysis for acute toxicity showed significantly 
increased toxicity for cCRT (P = .008), WHO ≥2 (P = .006), and TNM IIIC 
(P = .031). The multivariable analysis for acute toxicity was significant for 
cCRT (P = .015), WHO ≥2 (P = .001) and TNM IIIC (P = .016). The univariable 
analysis for 3-month mortality showed significance for seqCRT (P = .025), WHO ≥2 
(P < .001), higher cumulative radiotherapy dose (P < .001), higher gross tumor 
volume total (P = .020) and male patients (p < .001). None of these variables 
reached significance in the multivariable analysis for 3-month mortality.
CONCLUSION: In this national lung cancer audit of inoperable NSCLC patients, 
3-month toxicity was significantly higher in patients treated with cCRT (21.9% 
vs. 17.7% for seqCRT) higher TNM stage IIIC, and poor performance (WHO≥2) 
patients.The 3-months mortality was not significantly different for tested 
parameters. Age was not a risk factor for acute toxicity, nor 3 months 
mortality."
616,"Menopause is not only the end of reproductive life, it is also related to 
diseases such as hyperlipidaemia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 
osteoporosis and breast cancer. Traditional epidemiological studies have found 
that heredity is the main determinant of age at natural menopause (ANM). Early 
studies on genetic factors were limited to candidate gene studies. Menopause age 
is not inherited by a single gene, but is the result of multiple gene effects. 
With the development of genomic technology, the Reproductive Genetics Consortium 
conducted several genome-wide association studies on ANM in people of European 
descent, and found that defects in DNA damage repair pathways were the main 
genetic mechanism. In recent years, due to the ethnic heterogeneity of ANM, 
there has been further development of global studies into multi-ethnic and 
trans-ethnic genome-wide association studies. Further genetic and 
epidemiological studies, including polygenetic score and genetic mechanism 
research, should be conducted to investigate the pathogenesis and mechanism with 
respect to menopause and its related diseases."
617,"BACKGROUND: Although androgen receptor-targeted agents prolong the lives of 
patients with metastatic prostate cancer, patients develop therapy resistance 
and most ultimately succumb to the disease. The PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway has been 
associated with the development of resistance, raising the possibility that 
pathway inhibitors may produce a clinical benefit. This open-label phase Ib 
study examined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary 
clinical activity of adding capivasertib - a potent, selective inhibitor of 
AKT1/2/3 - to approved abiraterone acetate therapy.
METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer who had undergone at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy received 
abiraterone acetate 1000 mg (orally administered once daily), plus oral 
prednisone 5 mg (twice daily) with capivasertib 400 mg (orally, twice daily, 
with an intermittent schedule of 4 days on, 3 days off).
RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. The most frequent adverse 
events (all grade) were diarrhea (30%), anemia (26%), asthenia (22%), and nausea 
(22%). The most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events were acute kidney 
injury (19%), hyperglycemia (7%), rash (7%), abdominal pain (7%), and asthenia 
(7%). Capivasertib and abiraterone PK were consistent with previously reported 
results from monotherapy dosing. Nine participants (33%) showed a 20% or greater 
decrease in prostate-specific antigen during study treatment.
CONCLUSION: The combination of capivasertib and abiraterone acetate had an 
acceptable tolerability profile consistent with the known profile of each agent. 
These data support further evaluation of capivasertib and abiraterone acetate in 
patients with advanced prostate cancer."
618,"INTRODUCTION: Although the association between health insurance coverage and 
access to care is well documented, it is unclear whether the deleterious effects 
of being uninsured are strictly contemporaneous or whether previous disruptions 
in coverage have persistent effects. This study addresses this issue using 
nationally representative data covering 2011-2019 to estimate the extent to 
which disruptions in health insurance coverage continued to be associated with 
poor access even after coverage was regained.
METHODS: Analysis was conducted in 2022. Using a nationally representative 
cohort of insured adults aged 18-64 years (N=39,904) and multivariable logistic 
regression models, the authors estimated the association between past 
disruptions in coverage (occurring at least 1 year before) and the risks of 
lacking a usual source of care provider and having unmet medical need.
RESULTS: Among insured nonelderly adults, the risk of being without a usual 
source of care provider was between 18% (risk ratio=1.18; 95% CI=1.00, 1.38) and 
75% higher (risk ratio=1.75; 95% CI=1.56, 1.93) than for those with continuous 
coverage; the risk of having unmet medical needs was between 41% (risk 
ratio=1.41; 95% CI=1.00, 1.83) and 66% (risk ratio=1.66; 95% CI=1.26, 2.06) 
higher. Longer insurance disruptions were associated with a higher risk of 
lacking a usual source of care provider.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous disruptions in health insurance coverage continued to be 
negatively associated with access to care for more than a year after coverage 
was regained. Improving access to care in the U.S. may require investing in 
policies and programs that help to strengthen coverage continuity among 
individuals with insurance coverage rather than focusing exclusively on helping 
uninsured individuals to gain coverage."

(HUVECs) showed decreased THP-1 adhesion and infiltration when treated with 
Cav-2 siRNA compared to control siRNA. In contrast, Cav-2 overexpression 
increased THP-1 adhesion and infiltration in HUVECs. Increased expression of 
Cav-2 and iba-1 was observed in brains of old mice. Moreover, there were fewer 
iba-1-positive cells in the brains of aged Cav-2 knockout (KO) mice than of 
wild-type aged mice. The levels of several chemokines were higher in brains of 
aged wild-type mice than in young wild-type mice; moreover, chemokine levels 
were significantly lower in brains of young mice as well as aged Cav-2 KO mice 
than in their wild-type counterparts. Expression of PECAM1 and VE-cadherin 
proteins increased in brains of old wild-type mice but was barely detected in 
brains of young wild-type and Cav-2 KO mice. Collectively, our results suggest 
that Cav-2 expression increases in the endothelial cells of aged brain, and 
promotes leukocyte infiltration and age-associated neuroinflammation."
620,"Liver cancer has a high prevalence, with majority of the cases presenting as 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prognosis of metastatic HCC has hardly 
improved over the past decade, highlighting the necessity for liver cancer 
research. Studies have reported the ability of the KiSS1 gene to inhibit the 
growth or metastasis of liver cancer, but contradictory research results are 
also emerging. We, therefore, sought to investigate the effects of KiSS1 on 
growth and migration in human HCC cells. HepG2 human HCC cells were infected 
with lentivirus particles containing KiSS1. The overexpression of KiSS1 resulted 
in an increased proliferation rate of HCC cells. Quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction and immunoblotting revealed increased Akt activity, and downregulation 
of the G1/S phase cell cycle inhibitors. A significant increase in tumor 
spheroid formation with upregulation of β-catenin and CD133 was also observed. 
KiSS1 overexpression promoted the migratory, invasive ability, and metastatic 
capacity of the hepatocarcinoma cell line, and these effects were associated 
with changes in the expressions of epithelial mesenchymal transition 
(EMT)-related genes such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and slug. KiSS1 
overexpression also resulted in dramatically increased tumor growth in the 
xenograft mouse model, and upregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen 
(PCNA) and Ki-67 in the HCC tumors. Furthermore, KiSS1 increased the angiogenic 
capacity by upregulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) 
and CD31. Based on these observations, we infer that KiSS1 not only induces HCC 
proliferation, but also increases the metastatic potential by increasing the 
migratory ability and angiogenic capacity."
621,"Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a highly aggressive pediatric malignancy with 
no effective therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to identify a target for the 
development of novel molecule-targeting therapeutic agents. In this study, we 
report the importance of the runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) and 
RUNX1-Baculoviral IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) Repeat-Containing 5 
(BIRC5/survivin) axis in the proliferation of MRT cells, as it can be used as an 
ideal target for anti-tumor strategies. The mechanism of this reaction can be 
explained by the interaction of RUNX1 with the RUNX1-binding DNA sequence 
located in the survivin promoter and its positive regulation. Specific knockdown 
of RUNX1 led to decreased expression of survivin, which subsequently suppressed 
the proliferation of MRT cells in vitro and in vivo. We also found that our 
novel RUNX inhibitor, Chb-M, which switches off RUNX1 using alkylating 
agent-conjugated pyrrole-imidazole polyamides designed to specifically bind to 
consensus RUNX-binding sequences (5'-TGTGGT-3'), inhibited survivin expression 
in vivo. Taken together, we identified a novel interaction between RUNX1 and 
survivin in MRT. Therefore the negative regulation of RUNX1 activity may be a 
novel strategy for MRT treatment."
622,"BACKGROUND: Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is an oncogene that inhibits p53, 
leading to decreased apoptosis. Sarcomas showing MDM2 amplification are rare 
among pediatric patients.
CASE: A 14-year-old boy presented with pleomorphic sarcoma of the head showing 
MDM2 amplification without a well-differentiated liposarcoma component. Although 
chemotherapy was initially performed to reduce the tumor size before surgery, 
the tumor did not shrink. The patient underwent complete surgical resection. 
Microscopic examination revealed a positive surgical margin; thus, postoperative 
proton-beam radiotherapy was performed. 3 years after the therapy, no sign of 
recurrence was observed.
CONCLUSION: Macroscopic surgical resection combined with adjuvant postoperative 
radiotherapy was effective against MDM2-amplified pleomorphic sarcoma refractory 
to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a pediatric patient."
623,"BACKGROUND: Herein, for the first time, we present a case with mixed invasive 
micropapillary and neuroendocrine mammary neoplasm.
CASE: The patient, a 65-year-old postmenopausal woman, had become aware of a 
tumor in her right breast 11 months prior to presentation at our hospital. The 
cut surface of the mastectomy specimen contained a well-circumscribed, 
multinodular, red-brown tumor, measuring 15x15x15 cm. Histopathologically, this 
solid cystic lesion consisted of medullary growth of cancer cells accompanied by 
a well-developed vascular network as well as conspicuous hemorrhage. Cancer cell 
nests of various sizes displayed an ""inside-out"" structure surrounded by empty 
spaces. Most cancer cells were polygonal, though a few were short 
fusiform-shaped, and possessed finely granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm and 
ovoid, fine-granular nuclei. Eighteen mitotic figures were observed in 10 
high-power fields. Macrometastases, up to 13x8 mm in size, with the same 
morphological features as the original tumor site, were identified in 3 of 15 
dissected right axillary nodes. Immunohistochemically, primary and metastatic 
cancer cells were diffusely positive for chromogranin A and the estrogen 
receptor (Allred's total score: 8) and focally reactive for synaptophysin and 
the progesterone receptor (total score: 5). HER2 and cytokeratin 5/6 were 
negative, and the MIB-1 labelling index was 36.2%. MUC1 and EMA lined the 
stroma-facing surfaces of the cell membranes, indicating reversed polarity.
CONCLUSION: Our current patient, who had an invasive breast carcinoma with 
concomitant neuroendocrine and micropapillary features, developed multiple nodal 
metastases in association with a large-diameter tumor showing a luminal B-like 
immuno-profile. Accordingly, meticulous clinical follow-up remains essential for 
this uncommon case."
624,"Lung cancer is a severe health problem that affects more men than women around 
the world. The goal of this study was to identify the biomarker hub genes for 
lung cancer in order to ascertain the biological pathway and protein- protein 
interaction networks. The microarray datasets GSE80796, GSE68571, GSE118370 and 
GSE43458 were retrieved from the GEO database and were analysed using GEO2R. 
STRING, Cytoscape, and cytoHubba were used to construct the PPI network and hub 
genes. GEPIA was used to obtain the overall survival and expression level in 
LUAD/LUSC and normal tissue. The MTT assay was used to examine antiproliferative 
activity. PI staining was used to determine the cell cycle arrest. qPCR was used 
to analyse gene expressions. The datasets revealed a total of 401 common DEGs, 
with 258 up-regulated genes and 143 down-regulated genes. Further, in-vitro 
study of gallic acid cytotoxic effect in human lung cancer cell line A549 
indicated that gallic acid dramatically suppressed cell growth in A549 cells. 
Gallic acid also, significantly promoted programmed cell death by halting cells 
in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Taken together, our study indicated that 
gallic acid is a promising natural STAT1 inhibitor as it hindered lung cancer 
progression by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis which can be employed to 
increase the therapeutic efficacy of existing lung cancer treatments and to 
improve overall patient survival.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
625,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy (RAMIE) is gaining 
increasing popularity as an operative approach. Learning curves to achieve 
surgical competency in robotic-assisted techniques have shown significant 
variation in learning curve lengths and outcomes. This study aimed to summarize 
the current literature on learning curves for RAMIE.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. 
Electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library were searched, and 
articles reporting on learning curves in RAMIE were identified and scrutinized. 
Studies were eligible if they reported changes in operative outcomes over time, 
or learning curves, for surgeons newly adopting RAMIE.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies reporting on 1767 patients were included. Nine studies 
reported on surgeons with prior experience of robot-assisted surgery prior to 
adopting RAMIE, with only four studies outlining a specified RAMIE adoption 
pathway. Learning curves were most commonly analyzed using cumulative sum 
control chart (CUSUM) and were typically reported for lymph node yields and 
operative times, with significant variation in learning curve lengths (18-73 
cases and 20-80 cases, respectively). Most studies reported adoption without 
significant impact on clinical outcomes such as anastomotic leak; significant 
learning curves were more likely in studies, which did not report a formal 
learning or adoption pathway.
CONCLUSION: Reported RAMIE adoption phases are variable, with some authors 
suggesting significant impact to patients. With robust training through formal 
programmes or proctorship, however, others report RAMIE adoption without impact 
on clinical outcomes. A formalized adoption curriculum appears critical to 
prevent adverse effects on operative efficiency and patient care."
626,"To evaluate pathological complete response (pCR, ypT0ypN0) after neoadjuvant 
treatment compared with non-complete response (non-CR) in patients with 
esophageal cancer (EC), and 393 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Survival 
probability was analyzed in patients with: (i) pCR vs non-CR; (ii) complete 
response of the primary tumor but persisting lymphatic metastases (non-CR-T0N+) 
and (iii) pCR and tumor-free lymphnodes exhibiting signs of postneoadjuvant 
regression vs. no signs of regression. (i) Median overall survival (mOS) was 
favorable in patients with pCR (pCR: mOS not reached vs. non-CR: 41 months, 
P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that grade of regression was not an 
independent predictor for prolonged survival. Instead, the achieved 
postneoadjuvant TNM-stage (T-stage: Hazard ratio [HR] ypT3-T4 vs. ypT0-T2: 
1.837; N-stage: HR ypN1-N3 vs. ypN0: 2.046; Postneoadjuvant M-stage: HR ypM1 vs. 
ycM0: 2.709), the residual tumor (R)-classification (HR R1 vs. R0: 4.195) and 
the histologic subtype of EC (HR ESCC vs. EAC: 1.688) were prognostic factors. 
Patients with non-CR-T0N+ have a devastating prognosis, similar to those with 
local non-CR and lymphatic metastases (non-CR-T + N+) (non-CR-T0N+: 22.0 months, 
non-CR-T + N-: mOS not reached, non-CR-T + N+: 23.0 months; P-values: 
non-CR-T0N+ vs. non-CR-T + N-: 0.016; non-CR-T0N+ vs. non-CR-T + N+: 0.956; 
non-CR-T + N- vs. non-CR-T + N+: <0.001). Regressive changes in lymphnodes after 
neoadjuvant treatment did not influence survival-probability in patients with 
pCR (mOS not reached in each group; EAC-patients: P = 0.0919; ESCC-patients: 
P = 0.828). Particularly, the achieved postneoadjuvant ypTNM-stage influences 
the survival probability of patients with EC. Patients with non-CR-T0N+ have a 
dismal prognosis, and only true pathological complete response with ypT0ypN0 
offers superior survival probabilities."
627,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic exenteration surgery can improve survival in people with 
advanced colorectal cancer.This systematic review aimed to review pain intensity 
and other outcomes, for example the management of pain, the relationship between 
pain and the extent of surgery and the impact of pain on short term outcomes.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched from inception to 1st May 2021. We 
included interventional studies of adults with any indication for pelvic 
exenteration surgery that also reported pain outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed 
using ROBINS-1.
RESULTS: The search found 21 studies that reported pain following pelvic 
exenteration (n = 1,317 patients, mean age 58.4 years (SD 4.8). Ten studies were 
judged to be at moderate risk of bias. Before pelvic exenteration, pain was 
reported by 19-100% of patients. Five studies used validated measures of pain 
intensity. No study measured pain at all three-time points in the surgical 
journey. The presence of pain before surgery predicted postoperative adverse 
pain outcomes and pain is more likely to be experienced in those who require 
wider resections including bone resection.
CONCLUSION: Considering that pain and pelvic exenteration is commonly described 
by patients, the literature suggests that this symptom is not being measured and 
therefore addressed."
628,"The status of lymph node involvement is a major component of the tumor, node, 
metastasis (TNM) staging system. The N categories for lung cancer have remained 
unchanged since the 4th edition of the TNM staging system, partly because of 
differences in nodal mapping nomenclature, partly because of insufficient 
details to verify possible alternative approaches for staging. In preparation 
for the rigorous analysis of the International Association for the Study of Lung 
Cancer (IASLC) database necessary for the 9th edition TNM staging system, 
members of the N-Descriptors Subcommittee of the IASLC Staging and Prognostic 
Factors Committee reviewed the evidence for alternative approaches to 
categorizing the extent of lymph node involvement with lung cancer which is 
currently based solely on the anatomic location of lymph node metastasis. We 
reviewed the literature focusing on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to 
stimulate dialogue and mutual understanding among subcommittee members engaged 
in developing the 9th edition TNM staging system for lung cancer, which has been 
proposed for adoption by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and Union for 
International Cancer Control in 2024. The discussion of the range of possible 
revision options for the N categories, including the pros and cons of counting 
lymph nodes, lymph node stations or lymph node zones also provides transparency 
to the process, explaining why certain options may be discarded, others deferred 
for future consideration. Finally, we provide a preliminary discussion of the 
future directions that the N-Descriptors Subcommittee might consider for the 
10th edition and beyond."
629,"INTRODUCTION: In situ reconstruction (ISR) with autologous veins is the 
preferred method in infectious native aortic aneurysms (INAA) or vascular 
(endo)graft infection (VGEI). However, access to biological substitutes can 
prove difficult and lacks versatility. This study evaluates survival and freedom 
from reinfection after ISR of INAA/VGEI using the Antimicrobial InterGard 
Synergy graft combining silver and triclosan.
METHODS: From February 2014 to April 2020, 86 Antimicrobial grafts were 
implanted for aortic infection. The diagnosis of INAA/VGEI and reinfection was 
established based on the MAGIC criteria. Survival was analyzed using the 
Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank p-values.
RESULTS: The Antimicrobial graft was implanted in 32 cases of INAA, 28 of VGI, 
and 26 of VEI. Median age was 69.0 (IQR: 62.0;74.0), with a history of coronary 
artery disease (n=21; 24.4%), chronic kidney disease (n=11; 12.8%), cancer 
(n=21; 24.4%), and immunosuppression (n=27; 31.4%). Imaging showed infiltration 
(n=14; 16.3%), air (n=10; 11.6%), and rupture (n=16; 18.6% including 22 
aorto-enteric fistulae (AEnF)). Symptoms included fever (n=37; 43.0%), shock 
(n=11; 12.8%), and pain (n=47; 54.7%). Repair was undertaken through a midline 
laparotomy in 75 cases (87.2%) and coeliac cross-clamping in 19 (22.1%), 
supra-renal in 26 (30.2%), plus celiac trunk (n=3), mesenteric (n=5), renal 
(n=13) or hypogastric (n=4) artery reconstruction and omental flap coverage 
(n=41; 48.8%). For AEnF, the gastrointestinal tract was repaired using direct 
suture (n=14; 16.3%) or resection-anastomosis (n=8; 9.3%). Causative organisms 
were identified in 74 patients (86.0%), with polymicrobial infection in 32 
(37.2%) and fungal co-infection in 7 (8.1%). Thirty-day and in-hospital 
mortality were 14.0% and 22.1% (n=12 and 19 respectively, 3 INAA (9.4%), 7 VGI 
(25.0%) and 9 VEI (34.6%)). Seventy patients (81.4%) had a post-operative 
complication, 44 (51.2%) of whom returned to the operative room. The 1 and 
2-year survival rates were 74.0% (95%CI: 63.3-82.1) and 69.8% (95%CI: 
58.5-78.5). Survival was significantly better for INAA vs VGEI (p=.01) and worse 
for AEnF (p=.001). Freedom from reinfection was 97.2% (95%CI: 89.2-99.3) and 
95.0% (95%CI: 84.8-98.4) with 6 reinfections (7.0%) requiring 2 radiological/6 
surgical drainage and 2 graft removals. Primary patency was 88.0% (95%CI: 
78.1-93.6) and 79.9% (95%CI: 67.3-88.1) with no significant difference between 
INAA and VGEI (p=.16).
CONCLUSION: ISR of INAA or VGEI with the Antimicrobial graft showed encouraging 
early mortality, comparable to the rates found in femoral vein (9-16%) and 
arterial allograft (8-28%) studies, as well as mid-term reinfection. The highest 
in-hospital mortality was noted for VEI including nearly 50% of AEnF."
630,"A health risk assessment of inorganic and organic species associated with coarse 
and fine particulate matter (PM) was conducted in Southeastern Brazil. TSP, 
PM10, and PM2.5 samples were collected, and their elemental (metals/metalloids) 
and organic (PAHs) composition were determined by EDXRF and GC-MS. The health 
risks were determined through hazard quotient (HQ) and cancer risk (CR). It was 
found that different elements and routes of exposure lead to different health 
risks, even for the PM concentration in compliance with air quality standards. 
The major routes of exposure for adults were inhalation and dermal contact 
whereas for children were ingestion and dermal contact. High non-cancer risks 
(HQ) caused by Cl and Fe exposure were associated with coarser fractions, PM10 
and TSP, respectively, whereas high HQ for Se, Sb, and V exposure were 
associated with PM2.5. HQ values for children were near twice that for adults, 
and CR values were 65 % to 130 % higher for children than for adults. CR posed 
by PAHs was negligible. The results highlighted that the HQ might be over- or 
underestimated depending on the form in which the element Cl is determined 
(elemental or ion), reinforcing the need for an embracing chemical 
characterization of the PM. High HQ values were found related to the exposure to 
some elements present in the TSP, showing that this PM fraction should not be 
neglected."
631,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Quality indicators (QIs) for radiotherapy have been 
proposed by several groups, but no study has been conducted to correlate the 
implementation of indicators specific to patient safety over the course of the 
clinical process with an institution's background. An initial large-scale survey 
was conducted to understand the implementation status of QIs established for 
quality assurance and patient safety in radiotherapy and the relationship 
between implementation status and an institutions' background.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: Overall, 68 QIs that were established by this research 
team after a pilot survey were used to assess structures and processes for 
quality assurance and patient safety. Data on the implementation of QIs and the 
institutions' backgrounds were obtained from designated cancer care hospitals in 
Japan.
RESULTS: Overall, 284 institutions (72%) responded and had a median QI 
achievement rate of 60.8%. QIs with low implementation rates, such as the 
implementation of an error reporting system and establishment of a quality 
assurance department, were identified. The QI achievement rate and scale of the 
institution were positively correlated, and the achievement rate of all QIs was 
significantly higher (p < 0.001) in institutions capable of advanced treatments, 
such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, and those with a quality assurance 
department.
CONCLUSION: A large-scale survey on QIs revealed their implementation and 
relationship with a facility's background. QIs that require improvement were 
identified, and that these QIs might be effective in providing advanced medical 
care to many patients."
632,"Radiotherapy (RT) is a common and often essential treatment for breast cancer, 
but has been associated with pectoralis major (PM) muscle fibrosis and atrophy. 
In an initial prospective evaluation, we assessed muscle stiffness and muscle 
thickness of the sternocostal and clavicular regions of the PM with ultrasound 
shear wave elastography and B-mode imaging. Changes in PM muscle stiffness and 
thickness following RT can be detected within the first twelve months of RT 
completion. These parameters may potentially be useful for screening of patients 
who would benefit from post-RT physical therapy. Further studies with larger 
sample sizes that include patients who receive nodal radiation are necessary to 
confirm these findings."
633,"BACKGROUND: Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) can enhance local tumor regression, 
but its survival benefits compared to intensified chemoradiotherapy (CRT) 
followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) remain unclear.
METHODS: This is a secondary comparison between 607 patients treated with 
intensified 5-FU/Oxaliplatin neoadjuvant CRT and adjuvant CT within the 
experimental arm of the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 phase III trial, and 306 patients treated 
with TNT within the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 phase II trial. Comparison between 
clinical-pathological characteristics, surgical quality, and post-surgical 
complications were analyzed using the Pearson's Chi-squared or Mann-Whitney U 
test. Oncological outcome was examined with log-rank, Gray's test, and 
multivariate cox regression. In addition, further subgroup analyses and 
propensity score matching were performed to optimize the balance of baseline 
covariates. Findings Patients treated with CRT followed by consolidation CT had 
a significantly higher rate of pathological complete remission (pCR) compared to 
patients treated within the experimental arm of the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial (25.3% 
vs 17.3%, P=0.04). Post-surgical complications were less common in the 
CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial. After a median follow-up of 46 months, clinical outcome 
did not differ significantly in the overall cohort, in any subgroup or after 
propensity score matching. In multivariate analysis, disease-free survival (DFS) 
was similar between the experimental arm of the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial and 
treatments arms of the CAO/ARO/AIO-12 trial (vs arm A: HR 0.92 [95% CI 
0.62-1.37], P=0.69; vs arm B: HR 1.06 [95% CI 0.72-1.58], P=0.76). 
Interpretation Notwithstanding the limitations of intertrial comparison, TNT did 
not improve long term oncological outcome in our study compared to the 
intensified neoadjuvant CRT and adjuvant CT treatment in the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 
trial. Improved response rates after TNT offers an attractive option to explore 
organ preservation in selective patients with locally advanced rectal cancer."
634,"Eph receptors, the largest known family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and ephrin 
ligands have been implicated in a variety of human cancers. The novel 
bidirectional signaling events initiated by binding of Eph receptors to their 
cognate ephrin ligands modulate many cellular processes such as proliferation, 
metastasis, angiogenesis, invasion, and apoptosis. The relationships between the 
abundance of a unique subset of Eph receptors and ephrin ligands with associated 
cellular processes indicate a key role of these molecules in tumorigenesis. The 
combinatorial expression of these molecules converges on MAP kinase and/or 
AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. The intracellular target proteins of the initial 
signal may, however, vary in some cancers. Furthermore, we have also described 
the commonality of up- and down-regulation of individual receptors and ligands 
in various cancers. The current state of research in Eph receptors illustrates 
MAP kinase and mTOR pathways as plausible targets for therapeutic interventions 
in various cancers."
635,"Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) involving astrocytes is 
important for proper CNS homeostasis. As determined in our previous studies, 
trafficking of the predominant astrocyte GJ protein, Connexin43 (Cx43), is 
disrupted in response to infection with a neurotropic murine β-coronavirus 
(MHV-A59). However, how host factors are involved in Cx43 trafficking and the 
infection response is not clear. Here, we show that Cx43 retention due to 
MHV-A59 infection was associated with increased ER stress and reduced expression 
of chaperone protein ERp29. Treatment of MHV-A59-infected astrocytes with the 
chemical chaperone 4-sodium phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) increased ERp29 expression, 
rescued Cx43 transport to the cell surface, increased GJIC, and reduced ER 
stress. We obtained similar results using an astrocytoma cell line (DBT) upon 
MHV-A59 infection. Critically, DBT cells transfected to express exogenous ERp29 
were resistant to MHV-A59 infection and showed increased Cx43-mediated GJIC. 
Treatment with Cx43 mimetic peptides inhibited GJIC and increased viral 
susceptibility, demonstrating a role for intercellular communication in reducing 
MHV-A59 infectivity. Taken together, these results support a therapeutically 
targetable ERp29-dependent mechanism where β-coronavirus infectivity is 
modulated by reducing ER stress and rescuing Cx43 trafficking and function."
636,"Zika virus (ZIKV), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, causes congenital 
ZIKV syndrome in children and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) in adults. ZIKV 
expresses nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), a large protein that is essential for 
viral replication. ZIKV NS5 confers the ability to evade interferon (IFN) 
signalling; however, the exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we 
employed affinity pull-down and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) analyses and found that splicing factor 3b subunit 3 (SF3B3) is 
associated with the NS5-Flag pull-down complex through interaction with NS5. 
Functional assays showed that SF3B3 overexpression inhibited ZIKV replication by 
promoting IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression whereas silencing of SF3B3 
inhibited expression of ISGs to promote ZIKV replication. GTP cyclohydrolase I 
(GCH1) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) 
biosynthesis. NS5 upregulates the expression of GCH1 during ZIKV infection. And 
GCH1 marginally promoted ZIKV replication via the IFN pathway. Additionally, 
GCH1 expression is related to the regulation of SF3B3. Overexpression of the 
SF3B3 protein effectively reduced GCH1 protein levels, whereas SF3B3 knockdown 
increased its levels. These findings indicated that ZIKV NS5 binding protein 
SF3B3 contributed to the host immune response against ZIKV replication by 
modulating the expression of GCH1."
637,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance is embedded 
in clinical IBD practice, a subset of patients still develops advanced neoplasia 
(AN; high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and/or CRC). We aimed to assess the impact of 
surveillance quality on AN risk in IBD.
METHODS: In this multi-center case-control study, we searched the Dutch 
nationwide pathology databank to identify IBD cases with AN, and controls with 
indefinite or low-grade dysplasia. The surveillance colonoscopy preceding the 
index lesion (first IND/LGD or AN) was used to assess the impact of surveillance 
quality. We assessed intervals, bowel preparation, cecal intubation and absence 
of inflammation as primary quality indicators. In addition, we assessed 
chromo-endoscopy, endoscopist expertise, hospital setting and biopsy strategy. 
Associations of quality indicators with AN risk were determined with 
multivariable logistic regression analyses with Firth's correction.
RESULTS: We included 137 cases and 138 controls. Delayed intervals (58.2% vs 
39.6%) and active inflammation (65.3% vs 41.8%) were frequently present in cases 
and controls and were associated with AN (delayed interval: adjusted odds ratio 
(aOR) 2.00, 95% CI 1.07-3.81, p=0.03; active inflammation: aOR 2.46, 95% CI 
1.33-4.61, p<0.01). Surveillance compliant with primary quality indicators was 
associated with a reduced AN risk (aOR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, p=0.03), similar 
to chromo-endoscopy (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.89, p=0.01). Other indicators were 
not significantly associated with AN.
CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance compliant with primary quality indicators is 
associated with a reduced colitis-associated AN risk. Delayed surveillance 
intervals and active inflammation were associated with an increased AN risk. 
This underlines the importance of procedural quality, including endoscopic 
remission to optimize the effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance."
638,"OBJECTIVES: The EORTC QLU-C10D is a cancer-specific preference-based measure, 
providing health utilit ies for use in economic evaluations derived from the 
widely used health-related quality of life measure, EORTC QLQ-C30. Several EORTC 
QLU-C10D country-specific value sets are available. This article aims to provide 
EORTC QLU-C10D general population utility norms for Canada, France, Germany, 
Italy, Poland and the UK, to aid interpretability of obtained utilities in these 
countries.
METHODS: Data were collected in aforementioned countries via a quota-sampled, 
cross sectional online survey (n=100/age-sex group; n=approximately 
1,000/country). Participants were asked to complete the EORTC QLQ-C30 and 
provide sociodemographic data. Country-specific utility norms were calculated 
using the respective country tariff on the country's EORTC QLQ-C30 data after 
weighting to achieve population representativeness for age and sex. Norm values 
are provided as means (standard deviations) by country, age and sex groups. 
Tukey's multiple comparison test investigated mean differences between 
countries. The impact of country, age and sex on utility values was investigated 
with a multiple linear regression model.
RESULTS: Country-specific mean utilities range from 0.724 (UK) to 0.843 (Italy). 
Country-, sex-, and age-specific mean utilities range from 0.664 for 
30-39-year-old male Canadians to 0.899 for >70-year-old male Italians. Utilities 
were lower in females in 4/6 countries, and the impact of age differed between 
countries. Independent of the impact of age and sex, between-country differences 
were found (p-values ≤0.05).
CONCLUSION: Results showed a varying impact of age and sex on EORTC QLU-C10D 
utilities and significant between-country differences. Using national utility 
norms and utility decrements is recommended."
639,"PURPOSE: Dignity is a basic human right that is related to psychological 
distress factors in patients with cancer such as depression and demoralization. 
Hence, the dignity issue is of great importance to healthcare professionals. The 
present study aimed to advise healthcare professionals regarding the related 
distress factors of dignity in patients with cancer by investigating its 
relationship with patients' demographics, disease characteristics, and 
psychological distress.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study design. A convenience sample of 267 
patients with cancer from a medical center were recruited into this study. Each 
patient completed demographics and disease characteristics questionnaires, the 
Patient Dignity Inventory Mandarin Version (PDI-MV), the Demoralization Scale 
Mandarin Version (DS-MV), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Data 
were analyzed with SPSS 22.0 software.
RESULTS: Dignity was significantly correlated with age, demoralization and 
depression. Cancer patients aged 65 or above were more likely to have a lower 
sense of dignity. In the present study, the sensitivity and specificity of the 
Patient Dignity Inventory Mandarin Version for demoralization (DS-MV≥30) were 
84.8% and 79.1% and for depression (PHQ-9≥10) were 73.8% and 70.9% in cancer 
patients with an aggregate score of 35 or above.
CONCLUSIONS: Dignity is significantly correlated with personal demographic 
characteristics and psychological distress in patients with cancer. The results 
provide reference data for healthcare professionals to understand and enable 
dignity in patients with cancer and aid in the development of methods that 
promote their dignity."
640,"The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex niche enveloping a tumor formed by 
extracellular matrix, blood vessels, immune cells, and fibroblasts constantly 
interacting with cancer cells. Although TME is increasingly recognized as a 
major player in cancer initiation and progression in many tumor types, its 
involvement in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) pathogenesis is currently unknown. 
Here, we provide a molecular and functional characterization of 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the major TME component, in MCC 
patient-derived xenografts. We show that subcutaneous co-injection of 
patient-derived CAFs and human MCC MKL-1 cells into SCID mice significantly 
promotes tumor growth and metastasis. These fast-growing xenografts are 
characterized by areas densely populated with human CAFs, mainly localized 
around blood vessels. We here provide evidence that the growth-promoting 
activity of MCC-derived CAFs is mediated by the APA/AngII-III/AT1R axis, with 
the expression of aminopeptidase A (APA) in CAFs being a triggering event. 
Altogether, our findings point to APA as a potential marker for MCC prognostic 
stratification and as a candidate for therapeutic intervention."

643,"OBJECTIVE: Establishing a prognostic model for endometrial cancer (EC), that 
individualizes risk and management plan per patient and disease characteristics.
METHODS: this is multicentre retrospective study conducted in 9 European 
gynaecologic cancer centres. Women with confirmed EC between January 2008 to 
December 2015 were included. Demographics, disease characteristics, management, 
and follow-up information were collected. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) and 
disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 and 5 years comprise the primary outcomes of 
the study. Machine learning algorithms were applied to patient and disease 
characteristics. Model I: pre-treatment model. Calculated probability was added 
to management variables (model II: treatment model), and the second calculated 
probability was added to perioperative and postoperative variables (model III).
RESULTS: Out of 1,150 women, 1,144 were eligible for 3-year survival analysis 
and 860 for 5-year survival analysis. Model I, II, and III accuracies of 
prediction of 5-year CSS were 84.88%/85.47% (in train and test sets), 
85.47%/84.88% and 87.35%/86.05%, respectively. Model I predicted 3-year CSS at 
an accuracy of 91.34%/87.02%. Accuracy of model I, II and III in predicting 
5-year DFS were 74.63%/76.72%, 77.03%/76.72%, and 80.61%/77.78%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Endometrial Cancer Individualised Scoring System (ECISS) is a novel 
machine learning tool assessing patient-specific survival probability with high 
accuracy."

645,"Infantile hemangiomas are common vascular tumors with specific natural history. 
The proliferation and regression mechanism of infantile hemangiomas may be 
related to the multilineage differentiation ability of hemangioma stem cells, 
but the specific mechanism is not well elucidated. KIAA1429 is an N6 
-methyladenosine methylation-related proteins that can also exert its role in a 
methylation-independent manner. This study aims to explore the function of 
KIAA1429 in infantile hemangiomas. qRT-PCR, western blotting, and immunostaining 
were performed to verify the expression of KIAA1429. The endothelial and 
fibroblast-like phenotype of hemangioma endothelial cells were detected after 
KIAA1429 knockdown and overexpression. The Stemness properties of hemangioma 
endothelial cells and the underlying mechanism of KIAA1429 in hemangiomas were 
also investigated. Nude mouse models of infantile hemangiomas were conducted to 
ascertain the effects of KIAA1429 in vivo. The results showed that KIAA1429 was 
highly expressed in infantile hemangiomas, particularly in involuting 
hemangiomas. In vitro experiments confirmed that KIAA1429 inhibited the 
endothelial phenotype, enhanced the differentiation ability, and promoted the 
fibroblast-like phenotype of hemangioma endothelial cells by inducing 
endothelial cells transition to facultative stem cells. However, the effect of 
KIAA1429 on the potential target was shown to be independent of N6 
-methyladenosine methylation modification. Mouse models further revealed that 
KIAA1429 could inhibit the proliferation and promote the regression of 
hemangiomas. In conclusion, this study found that KIAA1429 played an important 
role in the regression of infantile hemangiomas by enhancing the stemness of 
hemangioma endothelial cells and could be a potential treatment target for 
infantile hemangiomas."
646,"INTRODUCTION: Despite aggressive surgical care and systemic therapy, patients 
with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have a poor prognosis. Recent 
studies show that racial disparities in outcome also exist. We sought to 
investigate the association lymph node (LN) metastases had with survival between 
Black and White patients with PDAC after resection.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 226 PDAC patients who underwent resection at 
a single institution from 2010 to 2018 was performed with attention to LN 
metastasis and patient race. The number of patients who received chemotherapy 
was also evaluated.
RESULTS: One Hundred Seventy Five (77.4%) PDAC patients were White and 51 
(22.6%) were Black. 130 (59.3%) patients had LN metastasis (LN+). LN+ and LN- 
groups were similar in race (P = 0.93), sex (P = 0.10) and age at the time of 
diagnosis (P = 0.45). Patients with LN + disease were more likely to present 
with larger tumors (3.4 versus 2.8 cm, P = 0.02) and higher T status 
(P = 0.001). White and Black patients had similar rates of LN metastasis (59% 
versus 58.8%, P = 1.0). The median survival for LN- Black and White patients 
were similar (43.2 versus 30.2 mo, P = 0.82). LN + Black patients trended 
towards receiving more systemic therapy than White LN + patients (55% versus 
42%, P = 0.10). The median survival for LN + Black patients was significantly 
less than LN + White patients (17.5 versus 24.6 mo, P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Black LN + PDAC patients have an inferior survival rate after 
resection when compared to their White counterparts. Our disparity in outcome 
cannot be solely explained by a difference in systemic treatment. Further 
investigation is warranted to determine racial differences in tumor biology or 
response to chemotherapy."
647,"Risk prediction models need thorough validation to assess their performance. 
Validation of models for survival outcomes poses challenges due to the censoring 
of observations and the varying time horizon at which predictions can be made. 
This article describes measures to evaluate predictions and the potential 
improvement in decision making from survival models based on Cox proportional 
hazards regression. As a motivating case study, the authors consider the 
prediction of the composite outcome of recurrence or death (the ""event"") in 
patients with breast cancer after surgery. They developed a simple Cox 
regression model with 3 predictors, as in the Nottingham Prognostic Index, in 
2982 women (1275 events over 5 years of follow-up) and externally validated this 
model in 686 women (285 events over 5 years). Improvement in performance was 
assessed after the addition of progesterone receptor as a prognostic biomarker. 
The model predictions can be evaluated across the full range of observed 
follow-up times or for the event occurring by the end of a fixed time horizon of 
interest. The authors first discuss recommended statistical measures that 
evaluate model performance in terms of discrimination, calibration, or overall 
performance. Further, they evaluate the potential clinical utility of the model 
to support clinical decision making according to a net benefit measure. They 
provide SAS and R code to illustrate internal and external validation. The 
authors recommend the proposed set of performance measures for transparent 
reporting of the validity of predictions from survival models."
648,"BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) offer an alternative to 
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and warfarin for treating cancer-associated 
thrombosis (CAT).
OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost and effectiveness of DOACs versus LMWH.
DESIGN: Cohort-state transition decision analytic model.
DATA SOURCES: Network meta-analysis comparing DOACs versus LMWH.
TARGET POPULATION: Adult patients with cancer at the time they develop 
thrombosis.
TIME HORIZON: Lifetime.
PERSPECTIVE: Health care sector.
INTERVENTION: Strategies of 1) enoxaparin, 2) apixaban, 3) edoxaban, and 4) 
rivaroxaban for treatment of CAT.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in 2022 U.S. 
dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: In the base-case scenario, using drug prices from 
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule, apixaban 
dominated enoxaparin and edoxaban by being less costly and more effective. 
Rivaroxaban was slightly more effective than apixaban, with an ICER of $493 246. 
In a scenario analysis using ""real-world"" drug prices from GoodRx, rivaroxaban 
was cost-effective with an ICER of $50 053 per QALY.
RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were highly sensitive to monthly drug 
costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that at a willingness-to-pay 
threshold of $50 000 per QALY, apixaban was preferred in 80% of simulations. 
However, sensitivity analyses also demonstrated that apixaban only remained 
cost-effective if monthly medication costs were below $530. Above this, 
rivaroxaban became cost-effective.
LIMITATIONS: An assumption was made that patients would continue anticoagulation 
indefinitely unless they suffered a major bleed. Nonmedical costs such as 
patient and caregiver loss of productivity were not accounted for, and long-term 
thrombotic complications were not explicitly modeled.
CONCLUSION: The 3 DOACs are more effective and more cost-effective than LMWH. 
The most cost-effective DOAC depends on the relative cost of each of these 
agents. These are important considerations for treating physicians and health 
policymakers.

health-promoting effects. MR is conducive to prevention of several chronic 
diseases and cancer, and extension of lifespan. A growing number of studies on 
new phenotypes and mechanisms of MR have become available in the past five 
years, especially in angiogenesis, neurodegenerative diseases, intestinal 
microbiota, and intestinal barrier function. In this review, we summarize the 
characteristics and advantages of MR, and current knowledge on the physiological 
responses and effects of MR on chronic diseases and aging-associated 
pathologies. Potential mechanisms, in which hydrogen sulfide, fibroblast growth 
factor 21, gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids, and so on are involved, are 
discussed. Moreover, directions for epigenetics and gut microbiota in an MR diet

650,"BACKGROUND: Gliomas with IDH1/2 mutations without 1p19q codeletion have been 
identified as the distinct diagnostic entity of IDH mutant astrocytoma (IDHmut 
astrocytoma). Homozygous deletion of Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor A/B 
(CDKN2A/B) has recently been incorporated in the grading of these tumors. The 
question of whether histologic parameters still contribute to prognostic 
information on top of the molecular classification, remains unanswered. Here we 
evaluated consensus histologic parameters for providing additional prognostic 
value in IDHmut astrocytomas.
METHODS: An international panel of seven neuropathologists scored 13 
well-defined histologic features in virtual microscopy images of 192 IDHmut 
astrocytomas from EORTC trial 22033-26033 (low-grade gliomas) and 263 from EORTC 
26053 (CATNON) (1p19q non-codeleted anaplastic glioma). For 192 gliomas the 
CDKN2A/B status was known. Consensus (agreement ≥ 4/7 panelists) histologic 
features were tested together with homozygous deletion (HD) of CDKN2A/B for 
independent prognostic power.
RESULTS: Among consensus histologic parameters, the mitotic count (cut-off of 2 
mitoses per 10 high power fields standardized to a field diameter of 0.55 mm and 
an area of 0.24 mm 2) significantly influences PFS (p = 0.0098) and marginally 
the OS (p = 0.07). Mitotic count also significantly affects the PFS of tumors 
with HD CDKN2A/B, but not the OS, possibly due to limited follow-up data.
CONCLUSION: The mitotic index (cut-off 2 per 10 40x HPF) is of prognostic 
significance in IDHmut astrocytomas without HD CDKN2A/B. Therefore, the mitotic 
index may direct the therapeutic approach for patients with IDHmut astrocytomas 
with native CDKN2A/B status."
651,"Lymphoceles are an important complication of pelvic and abdominal surgery with a 
reported incidence of 11%-88%. Conventional treatment includes compression, 
puncture aspiration, sclerotherapy, and ligation but recurrence is not uncommon 
and is difficult to treat. Recently, microsurgical lymphaticolymphatic 
anastomosis, lymphaticovenular anastomosis (LVA) and reconstruction of lymphatic 
circulation with flaps are increasingly being utilized for lymphocele treatment. 
Effective microsurgical treatment requires precise identification of the 
causative afferent vessels for the most efficient circulatory by-pass. However, 
direct identification of these vessels using traditional lymphoscintigraphy and 
near infrared lymphography is challenging and often not possible. We report the 
case of a 55-year-old woman who presented with bilateral inguinal lymphoceles 
and lymphedema following pelvic surgery for vulvovaginal cancer. Bilateral 
multiple LVAs of the lower extremities were performed and the lower limb 
circumferences reduced postoperatively, however both lymphoceles still 
persisted. The patient was successfully treated by approaching the lymphoceles 
from inside the lymphocele cavity. The causative afferent lymph vessels were 
directly identified microsurgically by gentle pressure on the inner wall and 
causative afferent lymph vessel lymphaticovenular anastomosis was performed. The 
lymphoceles resolved promptly after surgery without complications, and no 
recurrence was observed on 5 years follow-up. This case report presents an 
innovative microsurgical approach to lymphocele treatment, including examination 
and techniques to identify the causative afferent lymphatic vessels for 
effective anastomosis. We report this case to demonstrate the importance of 
lymphatic vessel selection in the microsurgical treatment of lymphocele."
652,"BACKGROUND: Informal caregivers of older adults experience a high degree of 
psychosocial burden and strain. These emotional experiences often stem from 
stressful tasks associated with caregiving. Caregiving supportive services that 
provide assistance for stressful tasks are instrumental in alleviating 
caregiving burden and strain. Research is limited on what types of supportive 
services caregivers are utilizing by relationship status and their source of 
information regarding these services. We sought to characterize caregiving 
supportive services use by caregiver relationship status.
METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the 2015 National Study of 
Caregiving limited to caregivers of older adults ≥65 years of age. Caregiver 
relationship status (i.e., spouse, child, other relative/non-relative) was the 
independent variable. Type of supportive service and source of information about 
supportive services were the dependent variables. Bivariate analyses were 
performed to examine the association with caregiver relationship status and 
associations between use of caregiving supportive services and caregiver and 
care recipient characteristics. Among service users, we measured associations 
between caregiver relationship status, type of supportive services used, and 
source of information about supportive services.
RESULTS: Our sample consisted of 1871 informal caregivers, 30.7% reported using 
supportive services. By caregiver relationship status, children had the greatest 
use of supportive services compared to spouses and other relatives/non-relatives 
(46.5% vs. 27.6% vs. 25.9%, p = <0.01, respectively). Among users of services, 
there were no differences in type of services used. Spouses primarily received 
their information about services from a medical provider or social worker 
(73.8%, p = <0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the need to ensure that other caregiving 
groups, such as spouses and other relatives/non-relatives, have access to 
important supportive services such as financial support. Medical providers 
and/or social workers should be leveraged and equipped to provide this 
information and refer to services accordingly."
653,"Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is becoming a promising radiation treatment 
technique dealing with tumors due to its cellular targeting specificity. In this 
article, based on the biocompatible chitosan oligosaccharide (COS), we designed 
a boron delivery system using carborane (CB) as a boron drug with cRGD peptide 
modification and paclitaxel (PTX) loaded in the hydrophobic core. The 
nanoparticles (cRGD-COS-CB/PTX) realized the boron delivery into tumor sites 
with an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and an active targeting 
effect achieved by the cRGD-integrin interaction on the surface of tumor cells. 
The uniform spherical nanoparticles can be selectively taken by hepatoma cells 
rather than normal hepatocytes. In vivo experiments showed that the 
nanoparticles had a targeting effect on tumor sites in both subcutaneous and 
orthotopic tumor models, which was an encouraging result for radiotherapy for 
liver cancer. To sum up, the nanoparticles we produced proved to be promising 
dual-functionalized nanoparticles for radiotherapy and chemotherapy."
654,"Invadopodia formation is regulated by Rho GTPases. However, the molecular 
mechanisms that control Rho GTPase signaling at invadopodia remain poorly 
understood. Here, we have identified ARHGAP17, a Cdc42-specific RhoGAP, as a key 
regulator of invadopodia in breast cancer cells and characterized a novel 
ARHGAP17-mediated signaling pathway that controls the spatiotemporal activity of 
Cdc42 during invadopodia turnover. Our results show that during invadopodia 
assembly, ARHGAP17 localizes to the invadopodia ring and restricts the activity 
of Cdc42 to the invadopodia core, where it promotes invadopodia growth. 
Invadopodia disassembly starts when ARHGAP17 translocates from the invadopodia 
ring to the core, in a process that is mediated by its interaction with the 
Cdc42 effector CIP4. Once at the core, ARHGAP17 inactivates Cdc42 to promote 
invadopodia disassembly. Our results in invadopodia provide new insights into 
the coordinated transition between the activation and inactivation of Rho 
GTPases."
655,"BACKGROUND: An optimal antithrombotic strategy for patients aged 80 years or 
older with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains elusive.
OBJECTIVE: Using a systematic review with traditional and network meta-analysis, 
we investigated outcomes in AF patients ≥80 years treated with different 
antithrombotic strategies.
METHODS: We searched eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 
observational studies from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science 
databases from inception to 16 December 2021. Research comparing treatment 
outcomes of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), aspirin, vitamin K antagonists 
(VKAs) or no oral anticoagulant/placebo therapy in patients ≥80 years with AF 
were included. Outcomes were stroke or systemic embolism (SSE), major bleeding, 
all-cause mortality, intracranial bleeding (ICH) and gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Traditional and network meta-analyses were performed. Net clinical benefit 
integrating SSE and major bleeding was calculated.
RESULTS: Fifty-three studies were identified for analysis. In the meta-analysis 
of RCTs, risk of SSE (risk ratio [RR]: 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.73-0.99) and ICH (RR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.28-0.52) was significantly reduced when 
NOACs were compared with VKAs. Network meta-analysis of RCTs demonstrated that 
edoxaban (P-score: 0.8976) and apixaban (P-score: 0.8528) outperformed other 
antithrombotic therapies by showing a lower major bleeding risk and better net 
clinical benefit. Both traditional and network meta-analyses from RCTs combining 
with observational studies showed consistent results.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients aged 80 years or older with AF, NOACs have better 
outcomes than VKAs regarding efficacy and safety profiles. Edoxaban and apixaban 
may be preferred treatment options since they are safer than other 
antithrombotic strategies."
656,"BACKGROUND: Bintrafusp alfa is a first-in-class bifunctional fusion protein 
composed of the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor beta receptor 
II (a TGF-β ""trap"") fused to a human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody 
blocking programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). We report the efficacy and 
safety in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that progressed 
following anti-PD-(L)1 therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this expansion cohort of NCT02517398-a global, 
open-label, phase I trial-adults with advanced NSCLC that progressed following 
chemotherapy and was primary refractory or had acquired resistance to 
anti-PD-(L)1 treatment received intravenous bintrafusp alfa 1200 mg every 2 
weeks until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or trial withdrawal. 
The primary endpoint was best overall response (by Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors version 1.1 adjudicated by independent review committee); 
secondary endpoints included safety.
RESULTS: Eighty-three eligible patients (62 [74.7%] treated with ≥3 prior 
therapies) received bintrafusp alfa. Four patients (3 primary refractory, 1 
acquired resistant) had confirmed partial responses (objective response rate, 
4.8%; 95% CI, 1.3%-11.9%), and 9 had stable disease. Tumor cell PD-L1 expression 
was not associated with response. Nineteen patients (22.9%) experienced grade ≥3 
treatment-related adverse events, most commonly asthenia (3 [3.6%]) and fatigue, 
eczema, and pruritus (2 each [2.4%]). One patient had grade 4 amylase increased. 
One patient died during treatment for pneumonia before initiation of bintrafusp 
alfa.
CONCLUSION: Although the primary endpoint was not met, bintrafusp alfa showed 
some clinical activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with heavily 
pretreated NSCLC, including prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Tumor responses occurred 
irrespective of whether disease was primary refractory or had acquired 
resistance to prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy."
657,"Fe has immense potential for biodegradable orthopedic applications, but it 
degrades slowly in the physiological environment. Inducing galvanic couple by 
alloying Cu to Fe using ball milling is a promising approach. However, the 
ductile nature of Cu leads to the cold welding of a large amount of Cu powder 
during ball milling, which makes it difficult to disperse uniformly in the Fe 
matrix. Here, a Fe-CuO implant with highly dispersed Cu particles in the matrix 
was developed by shift-speed ball milling and selective laser melting. 
Specifically, copper oxide (CuO) particles were selected as precursors and 
dispersed in Fe powders by ball milling since they were brittle and would not be 
cold-welded during ball milling. After further milling in higher energy, it was 
found that CuO particles reacted with Fe and generated Cu particles through a 
stress-activated redox reaction. Subsequently, the obtained powders were 
prepared into a Fe-CuO implant using selective laser melting. Microstructure 
examination revealed that the Cu phases in the implant were dispersed evenly in 
the Fe matrix, which was considered to establish a large number of galvanic 
couples and aggravated the galvanic corrosion tendency. Electrochemical tests 
indicated that the implant had improved performance in degradation behavior in 
terms of high corrosion current density (22.4 μA/cm2), low corrosion resistance 
(1319 Ω cm2), and good degradation stability. In addition, it presented 
antibacterial effects against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus by 
diffusion mechanisms with killing rates of 90.7 and 96.7%, respectively, as well 
as good cytocompatibility."
658,"INTRODUCTION: Splenogonadal fusion is a rare congenital anomaly. The aim of this 
study was to report a case of splenogonadal fusion mimicking a spermatic cord 
cyst, and discuss therapeutic management of this rare congenital malformation.
OBSERVATION: An eight-years old patient was presented with an asymptomatic 
three-centimeter oval scrotal mass mistaken for a spermatic cord cyst. Surgical 
exploration has revealed tow purple-red, firm encapsulated masses. The first 
mass was two cm long and adherent to the upper pole of the left testis with a 
cleavage plane. The second mass was four cm long, attached to the first by a 
fibrous cord and drawn on its superior pole by a serpiginous vascular structure 
that extended inside the abdomen. The spermatic cord was individualized. 
Extemporaneous anatomopathological examination of the first mass, totally 
excised, has concluded to benign lesion. Therefore, the peritoneum was opened, 
and the superior mass was excised as high as it could be reached without 
orchiectomy. Definitive Anatomopathological examination concluded to an ectopic 
splenic tissue. The final diagnosis was a continuous splenogonadal fusion.
CONCLUSION: This case highlights the clinical characteristics of this condition, 
with a special focus on the signs and findings that might help prevent 
unnecessary orchiectomy. Consequently, it is essential to include this 
malformation in the differential diagnosis of scrotal masses in children."
659,"INTRODUCTION: B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) is a proliferation of 
hematopoietic precursor cells characterized by the expression of various B-cell 
antigens. Expression of T cell antigens has rarely been reported in B-ALL. We 
report the second case CD5+ (Cluster of differentiation 5) B-ALL associated with 
Philadelphia chromosome (Phi+).
OBSERVATION: A 38-year old male presented with anorexia and generalized weakness 
for the last ten days. Hemogram revealed bicytopenia and hyperleukocytosis made 
of 93% difficult to classify cells. A diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
was suspected. An immunophenotyping on peripheral blood was performed. The panel 
for B- cell lineage chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPD) was used. The 
dim expression of CD45 and the lack of surface immunoglobuline helped to exclude 
a CD5 expressing mature B cell neoplasm. Then, the diagnosis of ALL was 
confirmed by ALL panels. Karyotype showed a Phi+. Thus, a diagnosis of B-ALL 
with aberrant expression of CD5 and Phi+ was established. The patient received 
chemotherapy according to the modified group for research on adult acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia philadelphia positive 2005 protocol (GRAAPH 2005). A 
complete remission at the end of induction was obtained. The patient received 
consolidation and then, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patient is 
in complete hematological remission till the date of submission of this report.
CONCLUSION: Aberrant expression of CD5 associated with Phi+ has rarely been 
reported in B cell lineage ALL and having a poor prognosis. Pathologists and 
clinicians should be aware of this entity to avoid confusion with other tumors."
660,"INTRODUCTION: pMCT is defined as a variant of papillary carcinoma that 
measures≤1 cm in diameter and which is characterized by an excellent prognosis. 
Recently, a proposal has been advanced to use the designation of papillary 
mirotumour (pMT) for pMCTs with no risk factors .
AIM: In this study, we aimed to reclassify pMCTs according to the Porto 
proposal(Pp) criteria.
METHODS: We have retrospectively collected cases of pMCT diagnosed in our 
pathology department over a period of 10years(2012-2022). Clinical and 
pathological parameters have been retrieved from the patient's medical records 
and pathological reports. We have evaluated all cases following the criteria of 
Pp. Cases that fulfilled all the criteria have been reclassified as pMT. We have 
briefly compared the clinical outcomes in both groups.
RESULTS: 29 cases of pMCT was found. Mean age of patients was 46,6 years-old 
(17-67) with a female predominance (sex ratio=0,45). 23 cases of pMCT were 
incidentally discovered. The tumor was located in the right thyroid lobe in 
15cases. The mean size of the tumor was 5,2mm. Multifocality was observed in 5 
cases. A total of 17 cases could be classified as pMT according to the Pp. Only 
one patient developed pulmonary metastasis and local recurrence; however it was 
related to the papillary carcinoma firstly diagnosed in his contralateral lobe. 
Clinical outcome was also good in the group of papillary microcarcinoma (pMC) 
with no recurrence or distant metastasis.
CONCLUSION: According to the Pp,>50% of pMCT could be reclassified as pMT which 
could reduce the psychological impact and overtreatment. Further studies with 
large sample size and molecular analysis are however needed in order to 
definitively validate and generalize the use of Porto proposal."
661,"Introduction : Le cancer colorectal constitue un problème majeur de santé 
publique. Chez les jeunes patients, son incidence ne cesse d'augmenter et son 
pronostic semble s'aggraver. Son traitement repose sur la chirurgie curative 
associée à des thérapies néo-adjuvantes et adjuvantes. L'objectif de notre 
travail a été d'étudier les caractéristiques cliniques et anatomopathologiques 
des patients atteints de cancers colorectaux chez les jeunes patients. Méthodes 
: Dans cette étude de cohorte monocentrique, nous avons analysé 
rétrospectivement les caractéristiques cliniques et anatomopathologiques chez 
les patients atteints de cancer colorectal ayant été pris en charge entre 2002 
et 2014. Les données des patients jeunes (groupe A, ≤50 ans) et plus âgés 
(groupe B, >50 ans) ont été comparées. Résultats : Deux cent soixante-six 
patients répondaient aux critères d'inclusion et de non-inclusion. Les groupes A 
et B représentaient respectivement 25,2% et 74,8% des patients. Les deux groupes 
étaient comparables en ce qui concerne la présentation et la durée des 
symptômes. Les tumeurs synchrones étaient plus fréquentes chez les patients du 
groupe A (10,7% contre 1,0%, p = 0,024). La stadification préopératoire a montré 
une fréquence plus élevée de tumeurs diagnostiquées à un stade avancé (stade III 
et IV) dans le groupe A (p = 0,001). Les patients du groupe A ont été 
diagnostiqués avec une proportion plus élevée d'adénocarcinomes peu différenciés 
ou indifférenciés (13,4% contre 3,5%, p = 0,005), le caractère mucineux était 
également plus fréquent dans ce groupe (28,4%). Selon la classification pTNM 
(tumor, nodes and metastases), les tumeurs étaient plus avancées dans le groupe 
A comparativement au groupe B (80,6% contre 48,7%, p < 0,001), Conclusion : 
Cette étude a révélé que les cancers colorectaux chez les patients jeunes 
étaient plus agressifs avec une plus grande proportion d'adénocarcinomes peu 
différenciés ou indifférenciés, plus souvent une production de mucine et des 
tumeurs plus avancées."
662,"AIM: Describe the epidemiological characteristics of occupational diseases (OD) 
recognized by the Central Medical Commission (CMC) of the first ministry during 
the period from 2012 to 2019.
METHODS: It was a descriptive and retrospective study covering all cases of 
diseases declared and recognized as occupational diseases by the CMC of the 
first ministry in the public sector and their repair during the period from the 
first of January 2012 to December 31, 2019.
RESULTS: During the study period, 294 OD were declared, of which, 213 were 
recognized by the CMC (72.4%). The average age of the population was 45.8 ± 10.9 
years. A female predominance was noted (61%). Most employees (56%) were part of 
the health sector. Tuberculosis was the most common occupational disease 
(21.1%). Cancers were present in 5.6% of cases. In this series, 99 workers had a 
temporary total disability (TTD) (46.5%). A partial permanent disability rate 
(PPD) was attributed to 20 victims of OD (9.4%) with an average rate of 29% and 
extremes ranging from 8% to 70%.
CONCLUSION: The OD recognized in the public sector seemed to be low. This 
encourages better information for workers on occupational risks and better 
awareness of attending physicians to report the professional nature of PD."
663,"Breast-cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a common consequence of oncological 
treatment. Its management is a complicated, chronic, and arduous process. 
Therapeutic options can be divided on non-surgical and surgical methods, 
although there is still no clear consensus about their effectiveness in 
preventing or stopping the disease. That brings problems in everyday practice, 
as there are no guidelines about proper time for starting therapy and no 
agreement about which management will be beneficial for each patient. The aim of 
this review is to summarize current knowledge about possible treatment choices, 
non-surgical so as surgical, indicate knowledge gaps, and try to direct pathways 
for future studies."
664,"The clinical approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors is an important 
advancement in the field of cancer immunotherapy. However, the percentage of 
beneficiaries is still limited and it is becoming clear that combination 
therapies are required to further enhance the treatment efficacy. The potential 
of strategies targeting the immunoregulatory network by ""hitting the gas pedal"" 
as opposed to ""blocking the brakes"" is being recognized and intensively 
investigated. Hence, next to immune checkpoint inhibitors, agonists of 
co-stimulatory receptors of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNF-SF) are 
emerging as promising options to expand the immunomodulatory toolbox. In this 
review the development of different categories of recombinant antibody and 
ligand-based agonists of 4-1BB, OX40, and GITR is summarized and discussed in 
the context of the challenges presented by the structural and mechanistical 
features of the TNFR-SF. An overview of current formats, trends, and clinical

667,"BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy of secondary pyeloplasty and balloon 
dilation and to analyze the risk factors for secondary surgical failure in 
patients with recurrent uretero-pelvic junction obstruction (UPJO).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 65 patients with recurrent UPJO who 
underwent secondary surgery between September 2011 and March 2019, of whom 33 
had complete baseline data and follow-up data. General clinical information, 
perioperative data, and follow-up results were collected from patients. Risk 
factors for surgical failure in patients with recurrent UPJO were analyzed using 
logistic regression.
RESULTS: The failure rates of secondary pyeloplasty and balloon dilation in 
secondary surgery were 16.7% and 33.3%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed 
that ureteral stenosis length and operative time were associated with secondary 
pyeloplasty and balloon dilatation failure (p < 0.05), and ureteral stenosis 
length was an independent risk factor for secondary pyeloplasty failure 
(OR = 0.074, 95% CI: 0.006-0.864, p = 0.038). In the balloon dilation group, 
treatment failure rates were significantly lower in patients with stenotic 
segment lengths less than 1 ± 0.32 cm than in patients with stenotic segment 
lengths greater than 1 ± 0.32 cm (p = 0.019).
CONCLUSIONS: The secondary pyeloplasty may provide better benefit. Ureteral 
stricture length is an independent risk factor for failure of secondary 
pyeloplasty and a potential risk factor for balloon dilatation. Operation time 
is a potential risk factor for pyeloplasty and balloon dilatation."
668,"A proof-of-concept of colloidal surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) 
substrate for rapid selective detection of overexpressed CA 15-3 biomarker in 
breast cancer serum (BCS) is suggested using PEGylated gold nanourchins (GNUs) 
conjugated with anti-CA 15-3 monoclonal antibody (mAb). UV-vis spectroscopy 
provided conformational information about mAb where the initial aromatic amino 
acid peak was red-shifted from 271 to 291 nm. The fluorescence peak of tyrosine 
in mAb was reduced by ≈ 77%, and red-shifted by ≈ 3 nm after incubation in BCS. 
Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy and SERS were used to study the 
composition and the molecular structure of the mAb and BCS. Some of the most 
dominant Raman shifts after GNU-PEG-mAb interaction with BCS are 498, 736, 818, 
1397, 1484, 2028, 2271, and 3227 cm-1 mainly corresponding to C-N-C in amines, 
vibrational modes of amino acids, C-H out-of-plane bend, C-O stretching 
carboxylic acid, the vibrational mode in phospholipids, NH3+ amine salt, C≡N 
stretching in nitriles, and O-H stretching. The intensity of SERS signals varied 
per trial due to the statistical behavior of GNU in BCS, agglomeration, laser 
power, and the heating effect. Despite very small amount of plasmonic heating, 
the result of the ANOVA test demonstrated that under our experimental 
conditions, the heating effect on signal variation is negligible and that the 
differences in the laser power are insignificant for all SERS observations 
(p > 0.6); thus, other parameters are responsible. The absorbance of 
mAb-conjugated GNU was decreased after five minutes of irradiation at 8 mW in 
the BCS."
669,"Italian Research Group for Gastric Cancer (GIRCG), during the 2013 annual 
Consensus Conference to gastric cancer, stated that laparoscopic or robotic 
approach should be limited only to early gastric cancer (EGC) and no further 
guidelines were currently available. However, accumulated evidences, mainly from 
eastern experiences, have supported the application of minimally invasive 
surgery also for locally advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The aim of our study is 
to give a snapshot of current surgical propensity of expert Italian upper 
gastrointestinal surgeons in performing minimally invasive techniques for the 
treatment of gastric cancer in order to answer to the question if clinical 
practice overcome the recommendation. Experts in the field among the Italian 
Research Group for Gastric Cancer (GIRCG) were invited to join a web 30-item 
survey through a formal e-mail from January 1st, 2020, to June 31st, 2020. 
Responses were collected from 46 participants out of 100 upper gastrointestinal 
surgeons. Percentage of surgeons choosing a minimally invasive approach to treat 
early and advanced gastric cancer was similar. Additionally analyzing data from 
the centers involved, we obtained that the percentage of minimally invasive 
total and partial gastrectomies in advanced cases augmented with the increase of 
surgical procedures performed per year (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04 respectively). It 
is reasonable to assume that there is a widening of indications given by the 
current national guideline into clinical practice. Propensity of expert Italian 
upper gastrointestinal surgeons was to perform minimally invasive surgery not 
only for early but also for advanced gastric cancer. Of interest volume activity 
correlated with the propensity of surgeons to select a minimally invasive 
approach."
670,"UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) metabolizes a number of endogenous and 
exogenous substrates. Renal cells express high amounts of UGT; however, the 
significance of UGT in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unknown. 
In this study, we profile the mRNA expression of UGT subtypes (UGT1A6, UGT1A9, 
and UGT2B7) and their genetic variants in the kidney tissue of 125 Japanese 
patients with RCC (Okayama University Hospital, Japan). In addition, we 
elucidate the association between the UGT variants and UGT mRNA expression 
levels and clinical outcomes in these patients. The three representative genetic 
variants, namely, UGT1A6 541A > G, UGT1A9 i399C > T, and UGT2B7-161C > T, were 
genotyped, and their mRNA expression levels in each tissue were determined. We 
found that the mRNA expression of the three UGTs (UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7) 
are significantly downregulated in RCC tissues. Moreover, in patients with RCC, 
the UGT2B7-161C > T variant and high UGT2B7 mRNA expression are significantly 
correlated with preferable cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival 
(OS), respectively. As such, the UGT2B7-161C > T variant and UGT2B7 mRNA 
expression level were identified as significant independent prognostic factors 
of CSS and CSS/OS, respectively. Taken together, these findings indicate that 
UGT2B7 has a role in RCC progression and may, therefore, represent a potential 
prognostic biomarker for patients with RCC."
671,"Mycosis Fungoides (MF) makes up the most of the cutaneous lymphomas. As a 
malignant disease, the greatest diagnostical challenge is to timely 
differentiate MF from inflammatory diseases. Contemporary computational methods 
successfully identify cell nuclei in histological specimens. Deep learning 
methods are especially favored for such tasks. A deep learning model was used to 
detect nuclei Hematoxylin-Eosin(H-E) stained micrographs. Nuclear properties are 
extracted after detection. A multi-layer perceptron classifier is used to detect 
lymphocytes specifically among the detected nuclei. The comparisons for each 
property between MF and non-MF were carried out using statistical tests the 
results are compared with the findings in the literature to provide a 
descriptive analysis as well. Random forest classifier method is used to build a 
model to classify MF and non-MF lymphocytes. 10 nuclear properties were 
statistically significantly different between MF and non-MF specimens. MF nuclei 
were smaller, darker and more heterogenous. Lymphocyte detection algorithm had 
an average 90.5% prediction power and MF detection algorithm had an average 
94.2% prediction power. This project aims to fill the gap between computational 
advancement and medical practice. The models could make MF diagnoses easier, 
more accurate and earlier. The results also challenge the manually examined and 
defined nuclear properties of MF with the help of data abundance and computer 
objectivity."
672,"Accurate measurement of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) copy 
number variation (CNV) is very important for guiding the tumor target therapy in 
breast cancer. Digital PCR (dPCR) is a sensitive and an absolute quantitative 
method, which can be used to detect HER2 CNV. Three HER2 exon-specific digital 
PCR assays along with three new reference genes assays (homo sapiens 
ribonuclease P RNA component H1 (RPPH1), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), 
and chromosome 1 open reading frame 43 (C1ORF43), on different chromosomes) were 
established and validated by using standard reference material, 8 different cell 
lines and 110 clinical Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. DPCR 
can achieve precise quantification of HER2 CNV by calculating the ratio of 
HER2/reference gene. The positive and negative coincidence rates were 98% 
(53/54) and 95% (53/56), respectively, compared with fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) diagnostic result 110 of FFPE samples. The common reference 
gene CEP17 used for FISH diagnostic was not suitable as single reference gene 
for HER2 CNV measurements by dPCR. The best practice of HER2 CNV determination 
by dPCR is to conduct the three duplex assays of H1 (HER2 exon 4) with the 
proposed three new reference genes, with a positive cut-off value of 
H1/RPPH1 ≥ 2.0 or H1/averaged reference gene ≥ 2.0. The proposed dPCR method in 
our study can accurately provide absolute copy number of HER2 and reference gene 
on an alternative chromosome, thus avoiding false negative caused by polysomy of 
chromosome 17. The improved molecular typing and diagnosis of breast cancer will 
better guide clinical medication."
673,"Local re-occurrence of cancer in patients with solid tumors is currently the 
most common reason for failure of treatment strategies. This fact indicates that 
prevailing approaches for tumor resection can cure only 50% of patients. A major 
cause of failure in tumor resection is off-target drug cytotoxicity and lack of 
sensitivity in tumor detection methods. These disadvantages are addressed with 
the development of targeted therapy and diagnostics, which significantly aid 
treatment strategies. Targeted diagnostics exploit properties of tumor cells 
that show significant up-regulation of tumor biomarkers. These biomarkers are 
targeted by a homing ligand attached to a fluorophore for visual inspection 
during surgery. However, these approaches suffer from disadvantages like high 
autofluorescence from background tissues, tissue absorption, and scattering, 
resulting in decreased image sensitivity and resolution. The use of 
near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores to overcome these drawbacks has generated 
unprecedented interest among researchers. The NIR window lies within the range 
of 650 to 1,700 nm, which results in reduced absorption and scattering by the 
tissues, thereby providing deeper tissue penetration and reduced 
autofluorescence. NIR fluorophores can be designed to target tumor biomarkers 
such as prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) or folate receptors found 
over-expressed on cancer tissues. These targeted fluorophores consist of 
small-molecule ligands conjugated with NIR dyes that bind with high specificity 
to PSMA and folic acid receptors. In this protocol, we have extensively 
described the methodology for the synthesis of targeted NIR agents for PSMA 
(DUPA-NIR bioconjugate) and folic acid (folate-NIR bioconjugate), along with 
detailed steps for preclinical evaluation. Procedures to calculate the binding 
affinity to cancer cells in vitro are described, along with uptake and 
biodistribution in different mice models in vivo. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

674,"BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Various types of stress initially induce a state of 
cardiac hypertrophy (CH) in the heart. But, persistent escalation of cardiac 
stress leads to progression from an adaptive physiological to a maladaptive 
pathological state. So, elucidating molecular mechanisms that can attenuate CH 
is imperative in developing cardiac therapies. Previously, we showed that 
Prohibitin1 (PHB1) has a protective role in CH-induced oxidative stress. 
Nevertheless, it is unclear how PHB1, a mitochondrial protein, has a protective 
role in CH. Therefore, we hypothesized that PHB1 maintains mitochondrial quality 
in CH. To test this hypothesis, we used Isoproterenol (ISO) to induce CH in H9C2 
cells overexpressing PHB1 and elucidated mitochondrial quality control pathways.
RESULTS: We found that overexpressing PHB1 attenuates ISO-induced CH and 
restores mitochondrial morphology in H9C2 cells. In addition, PHB1 blocks the 
pro-hypertrophic IGF1R/AKT pathway and restores the mitochondrial membrane 
polarization in ISO-treated cells. We observed that overexpressing PHB1 promotes 
mitochondrial biogenesis, improves mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and 
triggers mitophagy.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that PHB1 maintains mitochondrial quality in ISO-induced 
CH in H9C2 cells."
675,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric Epstein-Barr virus-negative monomorphic post solid organ 
transplant lymphoproliferative disorder [EBV(-)M-PTLD] comprises approximately 
10% of M-PTLD. No large multi-institutional pediatric-specific reports on 
treatment and outcome are available.
METHODS: A multi-institutional retrospective review of solid organ recipients 
diagnosed with EBV(-)M-PTLD aged ≤21 years between 2001 and 2020 in 12 centers 
in the United States and United Kingdom was performed, including demographics, 
staging, treatment, and outcomes data.
RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were identified with EBV(-)M-PTLD. Twenty-three 
(63.9%) were male. Median age (range) at transplantation, diagnosis of 
EBV(-)M-PTLD, and interval from transplant to PTLD were 2.2 years (0.1-17), 14 
years (3.0-20), and 8.5 years (0.6-18.3), respectively. Kidney (n = 17 [47.2%]) 
and heart (n = 13 [36.1%]) were the most commonly transplanted organs. Most were 
Murphy stage III (n = 25 [69.4%]). Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 22/34 
(64.7%) and ≥2 times upper limit of normal in 11/34 (32.4%). Pathological 
diagnoses included diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 31 [86.1%]) and 
B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) not otherwise specified (NOS) (n = 5 [13.9%]). Of 
nine different regimens used, the most common were: pediatric mature 
B-NHL-specific regimen (n = 13 [36.1%]) and low-dose cyclophosphamide, 
prednisone, and rituximab (n = 9 [25%]). Median follow-up from diagnosis was 3.0 
years (0.3-11.0 years). Three-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall 
survival (OS) were 64.8% and 79.9%, respectively. Of the seven deaths, six were 
from progressive disease.
CONCLUSIONS: EFS and OS were comparable to pediatric EBV(+) PTLD, but inferior 
to mature B-NHL in immunocompetent pediatric patients. The wide range of 
therapeutic regimens used directs our work toward developing an active 
multi-institutional registry to design prospective studies.
PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Pediatric Epstein-Barr virus-negative monomorphic post 
solid organ transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (EBV(-)M-PTLD) have 
comparable outcomes to EBV(+) PTLD, but are inferior to diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma in immunocompetent pediatric patients. The variety of treatment 
regimens used highlights the need to develop a pediatric PTLD registry to 
prospectively evaluate outcomes. The impact of treatment regimen on relapse risk 
could not be assessed because of small numbers. In the intensive pediatric 
B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma chemoimmunotherapy group, 11 of 13 patients remain alive 
in complete remission after 0.6 to 11 years."

678,"1 PURPOSE: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have become promising biomarkers for 
cancer management. Particularly, the molecular cargo such as proteins carried by 
EVs are similar to their cells of origin, providing important information that 
can be used for cancer diagnostics, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. 
However, to date, molecular analysis on EVs is still challenging, limited by the 
availability of efficient analytical technologies, largely due to the small size 
of EVs. In this work, we developed a computational workflow for in-silico 
identification of potential EV protein markers from genomics and proteomics 
databases, and applied it for the discovery of osteosarcoma (OS) EV protein 
markers. 2 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Both mRNA and protein data were computed and 
compared from publicly accessible databases, and top markers with high 
differential expression levels were selected. 3 RESULTS: Thirty nine markers 
were identified overexpressed and seven found to be downregulated. These 
identified markers have been found to be associated with OS on different aspects 
in literature, demonstrating the usability of this workflow. 4 CONCLUSIONS AND 
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This work provides a list of potential EV protein markers 
that are either overexpressed or downregulated in OS for further experimental

679,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to estimate the cumulative risks of 
all cancers in women from 50 to 75 years of age with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic 
variant.
METHODS: Participants were women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants from 85 
centers in 16 countries. Women were eligible if they had no cancer before the 
age of 50 years. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire and follow-up 
questionnaires every 2 years. Women were followed from age 50 until a diagnosis 
of cancer, death, age 75, or last follow-up. The risk of all cancers combined 
from age 50 to 75 was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: There were 2211 women included (1470 BRCA1 and 742 BRCA2). There were 
379 cancers diagnosed in the cohort between 50 and 75 years. The actuarial risk 
of any cancer from age 50 to 75 was 49% for BRCA1 and 43% for BRCA2. Breast 
(n = 186) and ovarian (n = 45) were the most frequent cancers observed. For 
women who had both risk-reducing mastectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 
before age 50, the risk of developing any cancer between age 50 and 75 was 9%.
CONCLUSION: Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant have a high risk of 
cancer between the ages of 50 and 75 years and should be counselled 
appropriately."
680,"BACKGROUND: This study was aimed at developing and validating a decision-making 
tool predictive of overall survival (OS) for patients receiving stereotactic 
body radiation therapy (SBRT) for spinal metastases.
METHODS: Three hundred sixty-one patients at one institution were used for the 
training set, and 182 at a second institution were used for external validation. 
Treatments most commonly involved one or three fractions of spine SBRT. 
Exclusion criteria included proton therapy and benign histologies.
RESULTS: The final model consisted of the following variables and scores: Spinal 
Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) ≥ 6 (1), time from primary diagnosis < 
21 months (1), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status = 1 
(1) or ECOG performance status > 1 (2), and >1 organ system involved (1). Each 
variable was an independent predictor of OS (p < .001), and each 1-point 
increase in the score was associated with a hazard ratio of 2.01 (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.79-2.25; p < .0001). The concordance value was 0.75 (95% CI, 
0.71-0.78). The scores were discretized into three groups-favorable (score = 
0-1), intermediate (score = 2), and poor survival (score = 3-5)-with 2-year OS 
rates of 84% (95% CI, 79%-90%), 46% (95% CI, 36%-59%), and 21% (95% CI, 
14%-32%), respectively (p < .0001 for each). In the external validation set (182 
patients), the score was also predictive of OS (p < .0001). Increasing 
SINS<zaq;6> was predictive of decreased OS as a continuous variable (p < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This novel score is proposed as a decision-making tool to help to 
optimize patient selection for spine SBRT. SINS may be an independent predictor 
of OS."

healthy control women matched for age and education. Episodic and working 
memory, executive functions, processing speed, attention, self-report cognitive 
difficulties (SRCD), fatigue, anxiety/depression were assessed with 
neuropsychological tests and self-report questionnaires, before treatment 
(baseline), about 1 (year-1) and 2 years (year-2) after diagnosis. We used 
linear mixed models to study changes in cognition and tested the effect of 
adjuvant chemotherapy.
RESULTS: We studied 276 localized breast cancer patients (62% chemotherapy 
(CT+)) compared to 135 healthy controls. After adjustment, patients had lower 
baseline working memory, processing speed and attention scores than healthy 
controls (p ≤ 0.001), and the difference remained significant over follow-up for 
working memory and processing speed. Executive function scores were similar 
between groups at baseline but decreased at year-1 among patients compared to 
healthy controls (p for change = 0.006). This decrease in CT+ patients was 
significant when compared to healthy controls scores (p for change < 0.001). 
After adjustment, SRCD were similar between breast cancer patients and healthy 
controls at baseline but increased in patients after treatment at year-1 (p for 
change = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive difficulties are an important concern in breast cancer 
patients, starting at diagnosis. Cancer treatments induce executive function 
decline and SRCD, which decrease over follow-up."
682,"Ion channels play an important role for regulation of the exocrine and the 
endocrine pancreas. This review focuses on the Ca2+-regulated K+ channel KCa3.1, 
encoded by the KCNN4 gene, which is present in both parts of the pancreas. In 
the islets of Langerhans, KCa3.1 channels are involved in the regulation of 
membrane potential oscillations characterizing nutrient-stimulated islet 
activity. Channel upregulation is induced by gluco- or lipotoxic conditions and 
might contribute to micro-inflammation and impaired insulin release in type 2 
diabetes mellitus as well as to diabetes-associated renal and vascular 
complications. In the exocrine pancreas KCa3.1 channels are expressed in acinar 
and ductal cells. They are thought to play a role for anion secretion during 
digestion but their physiological role has not been fully elucidated yet. 
Pancreatic carcinoma, especially pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is 
associated with drastic overexpression of KCa3.1. For pharmacological targeting 
of KCa3.1 channels, we are discussing the possible benefits KCa3.1 channel 
inhibitors might provide in the context of diabetes mellitus and pancreatic 
cancer, respectively. We are also giving a perspective for the use of a 
fluorescently labeled derivative of the KCa3.1 blocker senicapoc as a tool to 
monitor channel distribution in pancreatic tissue. In summary, modulating KCa3.1 
channel activity is a useful strategy for exo-and endocrine pancreatic disease 
but further studies are needed to evaluate its clinical suitability."
683,"OBJECTIVES: Pathological lymph node metastases are often observed in patients 
with clinical N0 lung cancer. Identifying preoperative predictors of occult 
hilar nodal metastasis is important in determining the surgical procedure in 
patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer. This study aimed to 
determine the frequency and predictors of occult hilar nodal metastasis by 
tumour location in these patients.
METHODS: Between April 2007 and May 2019, data of patients who underwent 
lobectomy or segmentectomy for clinical stage I pure-solid non-small cell lung 
cancer were retrospectively reviewed. The ratio of the distance from the 
pulmonary hilum to the proximal side of the tumour to the distance from the 
pulmonary hilum to the visceral pleural surface through the centre of the 
tumour, named ""distance ratio,"" was calculated. The relationship of the distance 
ratio with clinicopathological findings and prognosis was discussed.
RESULTS: A total of 357 patients were enrolled. Occult hilar nodal metastasis 
frequency was 14.6%. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether the 
distance ratio was ≤0.67 (central-type) or > 0.67 (peripheral-type). The 
frequency of occult hilar nodal metastasis was significantly higher in the 
distance ratio ≤0.67 group (21.5% vs 7.4%; P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis 
revealed that distance ratio was the only independent preoperative predictor of 
occult hilar nodal metastasis (odds ratio, 3.63; 95% confidence interval, 
1.83-7.18; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of occult hilar nodal metastasis was significantly 
higher in peripheral-type lung cancer; therefore, tumour location was the most 
important preoperative predictor of occult hilar nodal metastasis."
684,"The structural, composition, and molecular interaction of silver integrated zinc 
oxide (20 wt.% Ag/ZnO) were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy 
dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) 
spectrum. The XRD analysis showed the polycrystalline of small crystallite size, 
whereas the EDX spectrum confirmed the purity of the nanocomposite. The FTIR 
spectrum indicated the presence of Ag-Zn-O stretching vibration at 1034 cm-1. 
SEM and TEM images identified the surface morphology and particle size, 
indicating that Ag/ZnO of nanorods linked with spherical-like shapes. The 
nanorods of an average length of  ∼ 110 nm and an average diameter of  ∼ 10 nm. 
The optical characteristics showed a direct transition of electrons through an 
energy gap in the 3.30 eV-3.60 eV. The tested nanocomposite exhibited potent 
cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells with an IC50 value of 0.26 µg/ml with cell 
growth inhibition by 97.3% at the highest concentration compared to Doxorubicin 
(IC50=6.72 µg/ml). It significantly stimulated total apoptotic breast cancer 
cell death by 51-fold (32.16% compared to 0.63 for the control), arresting the 
cell progression at the G1 phase. For further validation of apoptotic activity, 
the tested Ag/ZnO-NP upregulated the proapoptotic genes and down-regulated the 
anti-apoptotic gene. Moreover, a molecular docking study highlighted the binding 
disposition of the nanocomposite as Bcl-2 inhibitors. Additionally, Ag/ZnO-NP 
exhibited potent antimicrobial activity. Hence, the synthesized nanocomposite 
can serve as an antimicrobial and cytotoxic agent through apoptosis-induction 
and could be developed as a biologically active nanocomposite.Communicated by

685,"PURPOSE: RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS) are commonly mutated genes in cancer, 
and activating RAS variants are also found in disorders of somatic mosaicism 
(DoSM). A survey of the mutational spectrum of RAS variants in DoSM has not been 
performed.
METHODS: A total of 938 individuals with suspected DoSM underwent 
high-sensitivity clinical NGS-based testing. We investigated the mutational 
spectrum and genotype-phenotype associations of mosaic RAS variants.
RESULTS: Here we present a series of individuals with DoSM with RAS variants. 
Classic hotspots, including Gly12, Gly13, and Gln61 constituted the majority of 
RAS variants observed in DoSM. Further, we present 12 individuals with HRAS and 
KRAS in-frame duplications/insertions (dup/ins) variants in the switch II 
domain. Among the 18.3% of individuals with RAS in-frame dup/ins variants, 
clinical findings were mainly associated with vascular malformations. Hotspots 
were associated with a broad phenotypic spectrum, including vascular tumors, 
vascular malformations, nevoid proliferations, segmental overgrowth, digital 
anomalies, and combinations. The median age at testing for individuals with 
in-frame dup/ins variants was older, and the variant allele fraction was lower 
compared to those with mosaic RAS hotspots.
CONCLUSION: Our work provides insight into the allelic and clinical 
heterogeneity of mosaic RAS variants in non-malignant conditions."
686,"Objective.Boaget al(1996) formulated a key model of collection efficiency for 
ionization chambers in pulsed radiation beams, in which some free electrons form 
negatively charged ions with a density that initially varies exponentially 
across the chamber. This non-uniform density complicates ion recombination 
calculations, in comparison with Boag's 1950 work in which a collection 
efficiency formula,f, was straightforwardly obtained assuming a uniform negative 
ion cloud. Boaget al(1996) therefore derived collection efficiency formulaef',f″ 
andf'″ based on three approximate descriptions of the exponentially-varying 
negative ion cloud, each uniform within a region. Collection efficiencies 
calculated by Boaget al(1996) using these formulae differed by a maximum of 5.1% 
relative (at 144 mGy dose-per-pulse with 212 V applied over a 1 mm electrode 
separation) and all three formulae are often used together. Here an exact 
solution of the exponentially-varying model is obtained.Approach.The exact 
solution was derived from a differential equation relating the number of 
negative ions collected from within some distance of the anode to numbers of 
ions initially located within that region. Using the resulting formula,fexp, 
collection efficiencies were calculated for a range of ionization chamber 
properties and doses-per-pulse, and compared withf,f',f″ andf″' values and 
results from an ion transport code.Main results.fexpvalues agreed to 5 decimal 
places with ion transport code results. The maximum relative difference 
betweenfexpandf″', which was often closest tofexp, was 0.78% for the chamber 
properties and doses-per-pulse studied by Boaget al(1996), rising to 6.1% at 1 
Gy dose-per-pulse and 2 mm electrode separation.Significance.Use offexpshould 
reduce ambiguities in collection efficiencies calculated using the approximate 
formulae, although like themfexpdoes not account for electric field distortion, 
which becomes substantial at doses-per-pulse ≥100 mGy."
687,"Survival studies are an important indicator of the success of cancer control. We 
analyzed the 5-year relative survival in 23 solid cancers in Denmark, Finland, 
Norway and Sweden over a 50-year period (1970-2019) at the NORDCAN database 
accessed from the International Agency for Research on Cancer website. We 
plotted survival curves in 5-year periods and showed 5-year periodic survival. 
The survival results were summarized in 4 groups: 1) cancers with historically 
good survival (>50% in 1970-74) which include melanoma and breast, endometrial 
and thyroid cancers; 2) cancers which constantly improved survival at least 20 % 
units over the 50 year period, including cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, 
kidney, brain and ovary; 3) cancer with increase in survival >20 % units with 
changes taking place in a narrow time window, including oral, oropharyngeal, 
testicular and prostate cancers; 4) the remaining cancers with <20 % unit 
improvement in survival including lung, esophageal, liver, pancreatic, bladder, 
soft tissue, penile, cervical and vulvar cancers. For cancers in groups 1 and 2, 
the constant development implied multiple improvements in therapy, diagnosis and 
patient care. Cancers in group 3 included testicular cancers with known 
therapeutic improvements but for the others large incidence changes probably 
implied that cancer stage (prostate) or etiology (oropharynx) changed into a 
more tractable form. Group 4 cancers included those with dismal survival 
50 years ago but a clear tendency upwards. In 17 cancers 5-year survival reached 
between 50 and 100 % while in only 6 cancers it remained at below 50%. This

688,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) derived from any tumor tissue could contribute to 
metastasis and resistance to cancer treatments. In this study, we performed 
single-cell next-generation sequencing of CTCs and evaluated usefulness for 
characterizing tumor biology and mechanisms of metastasis in neuroblastomas 
(NB). We aimed to isolate CTCs from ten patients with NB at diagnosis before any 
treatments and four patients at relapse. GD2+ , CD90+ , CD45- , CD235a- , and 
DAPI- cells were isolated as neuroblastoma CTCs using fluorescence-activated 
cell sorting. In five patients with advanced stages (M stage), DNA and RNA 
sequencing of CTCs at single-cell level were performed. NB CTCs were isolated 
from eight of the ten patients at diagnosis and three of the four patients at 
relapse. More CTCs could be isolated from patients with advanced stages. In one 
patient, ALK mutation (p.F1174L), was identified in both tumor tissue and a CTC. 
In patients with MYCN amplification, this gene was amplified in 12 of 13 CTCs. 
Using single-cell RNA sequencing, angiogenesis- and cell cycle-related genes 
together with CCND1, TUBA1A genes were found to be upregulated in CTCs. In one 
patient, CTCs were divided into two subgroups showing different gene expression 
profiles. In one subgroup, cell cycle- and proliferation-related genes were 
differentially upregulated than the other. In conclusion, next-generation 
sequencing of CTCs at single-cell level might help to characterize tumor biology 
and mechanisms of metastasis in NB."
689,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease affecting women, caused by 
somatic mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, and driven by estrogen. Similar to 
many cancers, it is metastatic, primarily to the lung. Despite its monogenetic 
nature, like many cancers, LAM is a heterogeneous disease. The cellular 
constituents of LAM are very diverse, including mesenchymal, epithelial, 
endothelial and immune cells. LAM is characterized by dysregulation of many cell 
signaling pathways, distinct populations of LAM cells, and a rich 
microenvironment, in which the immune system appears to play an important role. 
This review delineates the heterogeneity of LAM and focuses on the metastatic 
features of LAM, the deregulated signaling mechanisms and the tumor 
microenvironment. Understanding the tumor-host interaction in LAM may provide 
insights into development of new therapeutic strategies, which could be 
combinatorial or superlative to Sirolimus, the current FDA-approved treatment."
690,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has become one of the leading causes of 
cancer-related deaths across the world. A lack of durable responses to 
standard-of-care chemotherapies renders its treatment particularly challenging 
and largely contributes to the devastating outcome. Gemcitabine, a pyrimidine 
antimetabolite, is a cornerstone in PDA treatment. Given the importance of 
gemcitabine in PDA therapy, extensive efforts are focusing on exploring 
mechanisms by which cancer cells evade gemcitabine cytotoxicity, but strategies 
to overcome them have not been translated into patient care. Here, we will 
introduce the standard treatment paradigm for PDA patients, highlight mechanisms 
of gemcitabine action, elucidate gemcitabine resistance mechanisms, and discuss 
promising strategies to circumvent them."
691,"Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare condition that results from the 
dissemination of a mucinous primary tumor and the resultant accumulation of 
mucin-secreting tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity. PMP can arise from various 
types of cancers, including appendiceal, ovarian, and colorectal, though 
appendiceal neoplasms are by far the most common etiology. PMP is challenging to 
study due to its (1) rarity, (2) limited murine models, and (3) mucinous, 
acellular histology. The method presented here allows real-time visualization 
and interrogation of these tumor types using patient-derived ex vivo organotypic 
slices in a preparation where the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains intact. 
In this protocol, we first describe the preparation of tumor slices using a 
vibratome and subsequent long-term culture. Second, we describe confocal imaging 
of tumor slices and how to monitor functional readouts of viability, calcium 
imaging, and local proliferation. In short, slices are loaded with imaging dyes 
and are placed in an imaging chamber that can be mounted onto a confocal 
microscope. Time-lapse videos and confocal images are used to assess the initial 
viability and cellular functionality. This procedure also explores translational 
cellular movement, and paracrine signaling interactions in the TME. Lastly, we 
describe a dissociation protocol for tumor slices to be used for flow cytometry 
analysis. Quantitative flow cytometry analysis can be used for bench-to-bedside 
therapeutic testing to determine changes occurring within the immune landscape 
and epithelial cell content."
692,"There are still a limited number of primary interventions for prevention of 
breast cancer. For women at a high risk of developing breast cancer, the most 
effective intervention is prophylactic mastectomy. This is a drastic surgical 
procedure in which the mammary epithelial cells that can give rise to breast 
cancer are completely removed along with the surrounding tissue. The goal of 
this protocol is to demonstrate the feasibility of a minimally invasive 
intraductal procedure that could become a new primary intervention for breast 
cancer prevention. This local procedure would preferentially ablate mammary 
epithelial cells before they can become malignant. Intraductal methods to 
deliver solutions directly to these epithelial cells in rodent models of breast 
cancer have been developed at Michigan State University and elsewhere. The rat 
mammary gland consists of a single ductal tree that has a simpler and more 
linear architecture compared to the human breast. However, chemically induced 
rat models of breast cancer offer valuable tools for proof-of-concept studies of 
new preventive interventions and scalability from mouse models to humans. Here, 
a procedure for intraductal delivery of an ethanol-based ablative solution 
containing tantalum oxide nanoparticles as X-ray contrast agent and ethyl 
cellulose as gelling agent into the rat mammary ductal tree is described. 
Delivery of aqueous reagents (e.g., cytotoxic compounds, siRNAs, AdCre) by 
intraductal injection has been described previously in mouse and rat models. 
This protocol description emphasizes methodological changes and steps that 
pertain uniquely to delivering an ablative solution, formulation consideration 
to minimize local and systemic side effects of the ablative solution, and X-ray 
imaging for in vivo assessment of ductal tree filling. Fluoroscopy and micro-CT 
techniques enable to determine the success of ablative solution delivery and the 
extent of ductal tree filling thanks to compatibility with the 
tantalum-containing contrast agent."
693,"BACKGROUND: Cancer incidence is growing, with increasing treatment options and 
durations. This has led to an increase workload on the current Oncology 
workforce. The global pandemic has increased this pressure further.
AIMS: To determine the current medical oncology workforce in Victoria, current 
shortfalls, and future anticipated shortfall beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: A self-reported, cross sectional observational study of all current 
adult Victorian cancer services in June 2020 examining workforce, workload, and 
early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: The current average workload of 242 new patients per Full time 
equivalent (FTE) Consultant in medical oncology across Victoria. This is higher 
than optimal to deliver a safe and efficient cancer service. The significant 
variation in workforce between sites highlights the areas in need of most urgent 
resource allocation. Use of safe prescribing practises such as electronic 
chemotherapy prescribing are not universal, but urgently needed.
CONCLUSIONS: The medical oncology workforce in Victoria is inadequate to meet 
current and future demands. This needs to be addressed urgently to avoid an 
adverse impact on cancer measures and quality standards. Better, standardised, 
data collection is needed to allow for ongoing measures of workforce activity. 
Novel workforce solutions will also need to be implemented in the short and 
medium term in the face of global workforce shortages. This article is protected

694,"OBJECTIVE: We examined medical records to determine health conditions associated 
with dementia at varied intervals prior to dementia diagnosis in participants 
from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA).
METHODS: Data were available for 347 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 76 vascular 
dementia (VaD), and 811 control participants without dementia. Logistic 
regressions were performed associating ICD-9 health codes with dementia status 
across all timepoints, at 5 and 1 year(s) prior to dementia diagnosis, and at 
the year of diagnosis, controlling for age, sex and follow-up length of the 
medical record.
RESULTS: In AD, the earliest and most consistent associations across all time 
points included depression, erectile dysfunction, gait abnormalities, hearing 
loss, and nervous and musculoskeletal symptoms. Cardiomegaly, urinary 
incontinence, non-epithelial skin cancer, and pneumonia were not significant 
until 1 year before dementia diagnosis. In VaD, the earliest and most consistent 
associations across all time points included abnormal EKG, cardiac dysrhythmias, 
cerebrovascular disease, non-epithelial skin cancer, depression, and hearing 
loss. Atrial fibrillation, occlusion of cerebral arteries, essential tremor, and 
abnormal reflexes were not significant until 1 year before dementia diagnosis.
INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that some health conditions are 
associated with future dementia beginning at least 5 years before dementia 
diagnosis and are consistently seen over time, while others only reach 
significance closer to the date of diagnosis. These results also show that there 
are both shared and distinctive health conditions associated with AD and VaD. 
These results reinforce the need for medical intervention and treatment to 
lessen the impact of health comorbidities in the aging population. This article

695,"BACKGROUND: Methylene blue (MB) is used endoscopically to demarcate tumors and 
as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, there are few in 
vivo studies about its toxicity in healthy stomach tissue. We performed 
sequential in vitro and in vivo analyses of MB-induced phototoxicity.
METHODS: We performed in vitro experiments using the AGS human gastric cancer 
cell line treated with light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation (3.6 J/cm2) and 
MB. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP 
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. In vivo toxicity was evaluated in the stomach 
of beagles using the same dose of fiber-optic LED via gastroscopy, after 
spraying 0.1% and 0.5% MB solutions. Stomach tissue was also evaluated using the 
TUNEL assay.
RESULTS: In vitro, increased concentrations of MB led to higher TUNEL scores. 
However, cell viability was significantly lower after MB plus LED irradiation 
than after treatment with MB alone (P < 0.001). In vivo, the TUNEL score was 
highest immediately after treatment with 0.1% or 0.5% MB plus light irradiation, 
and the score was significantly higher in the LED illumination plus MB group 
than in the control group (P < 0.05). The elevated TUNEL score was maintained 
for 3 days in the MB plus light irradiation group but returned to normal levels 
on day 10.
CONCLUSIONS: : Endoscopic light application with MB 0.5% concentration to the 
stomach may be regarded as a safe procedure despite some DNA injuries in the 
early period."
696,"Acrylonitrile is a potential carcinogen for humans, and exposure to this 
substance can cause adverse effects for workers. This study aimed to 
carcinogenic and health risk assessment of acrylonitrile vapor exposure in 
exposed personnel of a petrochemical complex. This crosssectional study was 
performed in 2019 in a petrochemical complex. In this study, to sample and 
determine acrylonitrile's respiratory exposure, the method provided by the 
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH 1601) was used, and 
a total of 45 inhaled air samples were sampled from men workers, aged 39.43 ± 
9.37 years. All subjects' mean exposure to acrylonitrile vapors was 71.1 ± 122.8 
μg/m3. Also, the mean exposure index among all subjects was 0.02 ± 0.034. The 
non-carcinogenic risk assessment results showed that the mean Hazard quotient 
index was 4.04 ± 6.93. The mean lifetime cancer risk index was also 2.1 × 10-3 ± 
3.5 × 10-3 and was in the definite risk range. Considering that both 
carcinogenicity and health indicators of exposure to acrylonitrile in the 
studied petrochemical complex are more than the recommended limits, the 
necessary engineering and management measures to control and manage the risk to 
an acceptable level are essential to improving the worker's health."
697,"Molecular hydrogen (H2) is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent; however, 
the molecular mechanisms underlying its biological effects are largely unknown. 
Similar to other gaseous molecules such as inhalation anesthetics, H2 is more 
soluble in lipids than in water. A recent study demonstrated that H2 reduces 
radical polymerization-induced cellular damage by suppressing fatty acid 
peroxidation and membrane permeability. Thus, we sought to examine the effects 
of short exposure to H2 on lipid composition and associated physiological 
changes in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We analyzed cells by liquid 
chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry to define changes in lipid 
components. Lipid class analysis of cells exposed to H2 for 1 hour revealed 
transient increases in glycerophospholipids including phosphatidylethanolamine, 
phosphatidylinositol, and cardiolipin. Metabolomic analysis also showed that H2 
exposure for 1 hour transiently suppressed overall energy metabolism accompanied 
by a decrease in glutathione. We further observed alterations to endosomal 
morphology by staining with specific antibodies. Endosomal transport of cholera 
toxin B to recycling endosomes localized around the Golgi body was delayed in 
H2-exposed cells. We speculate that H2-induced modification of lipid composition 
depresses energy production and endosomal transport concomitant with enhancement 
of oxidative stress, which transiently stimulates stress response pathways to 
protect cells."
698,"Sublingual (SL) buprenorphine is approved for managing acute postoperative pain, 
characterized by easy administration, good pain relief and good patient 
compliance. We hypothesized that SL buprenorphine would be a better 
perioperative analgesic compared to intravenous (IV) opioids like tramadol in 
patients undergoing mastectomy surgery for breast cancer. After institutional 
ethics committee approval, we randomized 60 patients with breast cancer into 2 
groups. In buprenorphine group, patients received 200 μg of SL buprenorphine 
thrice daily and in tramadol group patients received 100 mg of IV tramadol 
thrice daily. The analgesic efficacy of SL buprenorphine was comparable to that 
of IV tramadol. Visual Analogue Scale scores had no significant difference 
between the two groups at various time frames (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours) 
at rest and movement except at 0 and 3 hours during movement when the score was 
lower in the tramadol group than the buprenorphine group. Four patients in the 
buprenorphine group received rescue analgesic (IV morphine 3 mg). Analgesic 
efficacy of SL buprenorphine appears comparable to IV tramadol for managing 
postoperative pain after mastectomy. SL buprenorphine can be administered 
sublingually, which is an advantage."
699,"Activating V600E in v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) is a 
common driver mutation in cancers of multiple tissue origins, including melanoma 
and glioma. BRAFV600E has also been implicated in neurodegeneration. The present 
study aims to characterize BRAFV600E during cell death and proliferation of 
three major cell types of the central nervous system: neurons, astrocytes, and 
microglia. Multiple primary cultures (primary cortical mixed culture) and cell 
lines of glial cells (BV2) and neurons (SH-SY5Y) were employed. BRAFV600E and 
BRAFWT expression was mediated by lentivirus or retrovirus. Blockage of 
downstream effectors (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and JNK1/2) were 
achieved by siRNA. In astrocytes and microglia, BRAFV600E induces cell 
proliferation, and the proliferative effect in microglia is mediated by 
activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, but not c-Jun N-terminal 
kinase. Conditioned medium from BRAFV600E-expressing microglia induced neuronal 
death. In neuronal cells, BRAFV600E directly induces neuronal death, through 
c-Jun N-terminal kinase but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase. We 
further show that BRAF-related genes are enriched in pathways in patients with 
Parkinson's disease. Our study identifies distinct consequences mediated by 
distinct downstream effectors in dividing glial cells and in neurons following 
the same BRAF mutational activation and a causal link between BRAF-activated 
microglia and neuronal cell death that does not require physical proximity. It 
provides insight into a possibly important role of BRAF in neurodegeneration as 
a result of either dysregulated BRAF in neurons or its impact on glial cells."
700,"Ferroptosis is a regulated form of cell death which is considered an oxidative 
iron-dependent process. The lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 
prevents the iron (Fe2+)-dependent formation of toxic lipid reactive oxygen 
species. While emerging evidence indicates that inhibition of glutathione 
peroxidase 4 as a hallmark of ferroptosis in many cancer cell lines, the 
involvement of this biochemical pathway in neuronal death remains largely 
unclear. Here, we investigate, first whether the ferroptosis key players are 
involved in the neuronal cell death induced by erastin. The second objective was 
to examine whether there is a cross talk between ferroptosis and autophagy. The 
third main was to address neuron response to erastin, with a special focus on 
ferritin and nuclear receptor coactivator 4-mediated ferritinophagy. To test 
this in neurons, erastin (0.5-8 µM) was applied to hippocampal HT22 neurons for 
16 hours. In addition, cells were cultured with the autophagy inhibitor, 
3-methyladenin (10 mM) and/or ferroptosis inhibitors, ferrostatin 1 (10-20 µM) 
or deferoxamine (10-200 µM) before exposure to erastin. In this study, we 
demonstrated by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis, that erastin 
downregulates dramatically the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4, the 
sodium-independent cystine-glutamate antiporter and nuclear receptor coactivator 
4. The protein levels of ferritin and mitochondrial ferritin in HT22 hippocampal 
neurons did not remarkably change following erastin treatment. In addition, we 
demonstrated that not only the ferroptosis inhibitor, ferrostatin1/deferoxamine 
abrogated the ferroptotic cell death induced by erastin in hippocampal HT22 
neurons, but also the potent autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenin. We conclude 
that (1) erastin-induced ferroptosis in hippocampal HT22 neurons, despite 
reduced nuclear receptor coactivator 4 levels, (2) that either nuclear receptor 
coactivator 4-mediated ferritinophagy does not occur or is of secondary 
importance in this model, (3) that ferroptosis seems to share some features of 
the autophagic cell death process."
701,"CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 can inhibit ferroptosis, which has been associated 
with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, in individuals with head and neck cancer. 
Therefore, CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 may be implicated in cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury. To validate this hypothesis in the present study, 
we established mouse models of occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and HT22 
cell models of oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation to mimic cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo and in vitro, respectively. We found 
remarkably decreased CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 expression in the mouse brain 
tissue and HT22 cells. When we used adeno-associated virus and plasmid to 
up-regulate CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 expression in the brain tissue and HT22 
cell models separately, mouse neurological dysfunction was greatly improved; the 
cerebral infarct volume was reduced; the survival rate of HT22 cells was 
increased; HT22 cell injury was alleviated; the expression of 
ferroptosis-related glutathione peroxidase 4, cystine-glutamate antiporter, and 
glutathione was increased; the levels of malondialdehyde, iron ions, and the 
expression of transferrin receptor 1 were decreased; and the expression of 
nuclear-factor E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 was increased. Inhibition of 
CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 upregulation via the nuclear-factor E2-related factor 
2 inhibitor ML385 in oxygen-glucose deprived and reoxygenated HT22 cells blocked 
the neuroprotective effects of CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 up-regulation and the 
activation of the nuclear-factor E2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 pathway. 
Our data indicate that the up-regulation of CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 can 
attenuate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, thus providing theoretical 
support from the perspectives of cytology and experimental zoology for the use 
of this protein as a therapeutic target in patients with cerebral 
ischemia/reperfusion injury."
702,"Alternative splicing is the process of producing variably spliced mRNAs by 
choosing distinct combinations of splice sites within a messenger RNA precursor. 
This splicing enables mRNA from a single gene to synthesize different proteins, 
which have different cellular properties and functions and yet arise from the 
same single gene. A family of splicing factors, Serine-arginine rich proteins, 
are needed to initiate the assembly and activation of the spliceosome. Serine 
and arginine rich splicing factor 1, part of the arginine/serine-rich splicing 
factor protein family, can either activate or inhibit the splicing of mRNAs, 
depending on the phosphorylation status of the protein and its interaction 
partners. Considering that serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 is either 
an activator or an inhibitor, this protein has been studied widely to identify 
its various roles in different diseases. Research has found that serine and 
arginine rich splicing factor 1 is a key target for neuroprotection, showing its 
promising potential use in therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders. 
Furthermore, serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 might be used to 
regulate cancer development and autoimmune diseases. In this review, we 
highlight how serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 has been studied 
concerning neuroprotection. In addition, we draw attention to how serine and 
arginine rich splicing factor 1 is being studied in cancer and immunological 
disorders, as well as how serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 acts 
outside the central or peripheral nervous system."
703,"We attempted to perform risk categories based on the free/total 
prostate-specific antigen ratio (%fPSA), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density 
(PSAD, in ng ml-2), and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) step 
by step, with the goal of determining the best clinical diagnostic strategy to 
avoid unnecessary tests and prostate biopsy (PBx) in biopsy-naïve men with PSA 
levels ranging from 4 ng ml-1 to 10 ng ml-1. We included 439 patients who had 
mpMRI and PBx between August 2018 and July 2021 (West China Hospital, Chengdu, 
China). To detect clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) on PBx, 
receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and their respective area under 
the curve were calculated. Based on %fPSA, PSAD, and Prostate Imaging-Reporting 
and Data System (PI-RADS) scores, the negative predictive value (NPV) and 
positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated sequentially. The optimal %fPSA 
threshold was determined to be 0.16, and the optimal PSAD threshold was 0.12 for 
%fPSA ≥0.16 and 0.23 for %fPSA <0.16, respectively. When PSAD <0.12 was combined 
with patients with %fPSA ≥0.16, the NPV of csPCa increased from 0.832 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.766-0.887) to 0.931 (95% CI: 0.833-0.981); the 
detection rate of csPCa was similar when further stratified by PI-RADS scores (P 
= 0.552). Combining %fPSA <0.16 with PSAD ≥0.23 ng ml-2 predicted significantly 
more csPCa patients than those with PSAD <0.23 ng ml-2 (58.4% vs 26.7%, P < 
0.001). Using PI-RADS scores 4 and 5, the PPV was 0.739 (95% CI: 0.634-0.827) 
when further stratified by mpMRI results. In biopsy-naïve patients with PSA 
level of 4-10 ng ml-1, stratification of %fPSA and PSAD combined with PI-RADS 
scores may be useful in the decision-making process prior to undergoing PBx."
704,"New coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic, has brought about a huge burden on global healthcare 
systems. Rapid and early detection is important to prevent the spread of the 
pandemic. Here, an assay based on CRISPR/Cas13a and catalytic hairpin assembly 
(CHA), termed as Cas-CHA, was developed for ultrasensitive and specific 
detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Upon specific recognition of the target, the 
CRISPR/Cas13a collaterally cleaved a well-designed hairpin reporter and 
triggered the CHA reaction. Under optimized conditions, the assay detected the 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA with a wide range of 100 aM to 100 nM and realized a low 
detection limit of 84 aM. At the same time, the whole detecting process could be 
completed within 35 min. More importantly, the assay was able to distinguish 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA from common human coronaviruses and analyze in saliva samples. By 
the flexible design of crRNA, the assay was expanded to detect other viruses. 
The clinical sample analysis verified that the proposed assay held a great 
potential for practical testing."
705,"The enzymatic cascades for ubiquitin transfer regulate key cellular processes 
and are the intense focus of drug development for treating cancer and 
neurodegenerative diseases. E1 is at the apex of the UB transfer cascade, and 
molecules inhibiting E1 have shown promising activities against cancer cell 
proliferation. Compared to small molecules, peptidomimetics have emerged as 
powerful tools to disrupt the protein-protein interactions (PPI) with less drug 
resistance and high stability in the cell. Herein, we harnessed the 
D-sulfono-γ-AA peptide to mimic the N-terminal helix of E2 and thereby inhibit 
E1-E2 interaction. Two stapled peptidomimetics, M1-S1 and M1-S2, were identified 
as effective inhibitors to block UB transfer from E1 to E2, as shown by in vitro 
and cellular assays. Our work suggested that PPIs with the N-terminal helix of 
E2 at the E1-E2 and E2-E3 interfaces could be a promising target for designing 
inhibitors against protein ubiquitination pathways in the cell."
706,"The SPF10-PCR-based line probe assay (LiPA-25) for human papillomavirus (HPV) 
genotyping with high analytical sensitivity and specificity was widely used in 
HPV vaccine clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. In the study, we aimed to 
compare a novel GP5+/6+-PCR-based reverse dot blot hybridization assay 
(Yaneng-23) with LiPA-25. The performance of two assays was evaluated in 1735 
cervical swab and 117 tissue samples, with a focus on 19 common HPV types (14 
high-risk: 16,18,31,33,35,39,45,51,52,56,58,59,66 and 68/73; 5 low-risk: 
6,11,42,43 and 53). A total of 1197 (69.0%) swab samples were identified as 
HPV-positive by two assays. Of these, 878 (73.4%) samples displayed absolute 
agreement (concordant), 255 (21.3%) showed additional or fewer types 
(compatible), and the remaining 64 (5.3%) samples were discordant. Additionally, 
the two assays showed an excellent strength of agreement for 19 HPV-combined 
detection (κ=0.886) and 17 individual HPV types (all κ>0.800), and displayed a 
good agreement for HPV39 (κ=0.780) and 42 (κ=0.699). Yaneng-23 was more 
sensitive than LiPA-25 for HPV58, 59, 68/73, 42, 43 and 53 (McNemar's test: all 
P<0.05), while LiPA-25 was more sensitive for HPV31, 39, 52 and 66 than 
Yaneng-23 (all P<0.05). In 113 HPV-positive tissue specimens, the identification 
of genotypes was 82.3% identical and 17.7% compatible. The agreement between the 
tests for HPV45 (κ=0.796) and 51 (κ=0.742) was good, and for other types (all 
κ>0.843) and 19 HPV-combined detection (κ=0.929) was perfect (all P>0.05). In 
conclusion, Yaneng-23 and LiPA-25 are comparable. Yaneng-23 could be used for 
the detection and genotyping of HPV in cervical samples for epidemiological and 
vaccine studies worldwide. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

707,"Heterogeneity of antibody responses has been reported in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 
recipients with underlying diseases. We investigated the impact of the presence 
of comorbidities on the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients 
with chronic disease (PWCD) and assessed the effect of the number of 
comorbidities on the humoral response to vaccination. In this study, 
neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding 
domain (RBD-IgG) were monitored following a full-course vaccination. In total, 
1400 PWCD (82.7%, inactivated vaccines; 17.3%, subunit recombinant vaccine) and 
245 healthy controls (65.7% inactivated vaccines, 34.3% subunit recombinant 
vaccine) vaccinated with inactivated or subunit recombinant SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, 
were included. The seroconversion and antibody levels of the NAbs and RBD-IgG 
were different in the PWCD group compared with those in the control group. 
Chronic hepatitis B (odds ratio [OR]: 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.46-0.93), cancer (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.42-0.99), and diabetes (OR: 0.50; 95% 
CI: 0.28-0.89) were associated with lower seroconversion of NAbs. Chronic kidney 
disease (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.11-0.76), cancer (OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.23-0.62), and 
diabetes (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20-0.69) were associated with lower seroconversion 
of RBD-IgG. Only the presence of autoimmune disease showed significantly lower 
NAbs and RBD-IgG titers. Patients with most types of chronic diseases showed 
similar responses to the controls, but humoral responses were still 
significantly associated with the presence of ≥2 coexisting diseases. Our study 
suggested that humoral responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are impaired 
in patients with certain chronic diseases. This article is protected by

708,"BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome (LS), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
pathogenic germline variants in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, represents the 
most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome. Lynch syndrome patients 
are at high risk of CRC despite regular endoscopic surveillance.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the diagnostic performance of artificial 
intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy in comparison to High-Definition 
white-light endoscopy (HD-WLE) for the first time.
METHODS: Patients ≥18 years with LS, with a pathogenic germline variant (MLH1, 
MHS2, MSH6), and at least one previous colonoscopy (interval 10-36 months) were 
eligible. Patients were stratified by previous CRC and affected MMR gene with a 
1:1 allocation ratio (AI-assisted vs. HD white-light endoscopy) in this 
exploratory pilot trial.
RESULTS: Between Dec-2021 and Dec-2022, 101 LS patients were randomised and 96 
patients were finally analyzed after exclusion of 5 patients due to insufficient 
bowel preparation. In the HD-WLE arm, adenomas were detected in 12/46 patients 
compared to 18/50 in the AI arm (26.1% [95% CI 14.3-41.1] vs. 36.0% [22.9-50.8]; 
p = 0.379). The use of AI-assisted colonoscopy especially increased detection of 
flat adenomas (Paris classification 0-IIb) (examinations with detected flat 
adenomas: 3/46 [6.5%] vs. 10/50 [20%]; p = 0.07; numbers of detected flat 
adenomas: 4/20 vs. 17/30, p = 0.018). The median withdrawal time did not differ 
significantly between HD-WLE and AI (14 vs. 15 min; p = 0.170).
CONCLUSION: We here present first data suggesting that real-time AI-assisted 
colonoscopy is a promising approach to optimize endoscopic surveillance in LS 
patients, in particular to improve the detection of flat adenomas."
709,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death 
worldwide, with up to 90% of HCC cases occurring in the setting of underlying 
cirrhosis. Therapeutic landscape for advanced HCC has dramatically changed in 
recent years with the advent of immunotherapy, including several combinations. 
Data suggest that the surrounding liver milieu may influence tumour response. In 
addition, different aetiologies of HCC and their effects on the host liver may 
impact response to immunotherapy. However, to date, guidelines do not take into 
account this parameter to guide therapeutic selection, and phase III trials are 
likewise performed in patients irrespective of HCC aetiology. Moreover, most 
clinical trial data are collected in highly selected patients with preserved 
liver function (defined as Child-Pugh class A) and controlled portal 
hypertension, which does not accurately reflect routine clinical practice. In 
this review, we discuss the influence of liver disease aetiology on the response 
to immunotherapy in patients with advanced HCC. We also discuss the safety and 
efficacy of various immunotherapeutic agents in Child-Pugh B patients to 
determine if these treatments are beneficial in this vulnerable patient 
population."
710,"Mycotoxins have substantial impacts on agricultural production and food 
preservation. Some have high similarities in bioactivity but subtle differences 
on structures from various fungal producers. Understanding of their complex 
cross-biosynthesis will provide new insights into enzyme functions and food 
safety. Here, based on structurally related mycotoxins, such as aurovertins, 
asteltoxin, and citreoviridin, we showed that methyltransferase (MT)-catalyzed 
methylation is required for efficient oxidation and polyketide stability. MTs 
have broad interactions with polyketide synthases and flavin-containing 
monooxygenases (FMOs), while MT AstB is required for FMO AstC functionality in 
vivo. FMOs have common catalysis on pyrone-polyene intermediates but different 
catalytic specificity and efficiency on oxidative intermediates for the 
selective production of more toxic and complex mycotoxins. Thus, the subtle 
protein interaction and elaborate versatile catalysis of biosynthetic enzymes 
contribute to the efficient and selective biosynthesis of these 
structure-related mycotoxins and provide the basis to re-evaluate and control 
mycotoxins for agricultural and food safety."
711,"Objective.4D dose calculation (4DDC) for pencil beam scanned (PBS) proton 
therapy is typically based on phase-sorting of individual pencil beams onto 
phases of a single breathing cycle 4DCT. Understanding the dosimetric 
limitations and uncertainties of this approach is essential, especially for the 
realistic treatment scenario with irregular free breathing motion.Approach.For 
three liver and three lung cancer patient CTs, the deformable multi-cycle motion 
from 4DMRIs was used to generate six synthetic 4DCT(MRI)s, providing irregular 
motion (11/15 cycles for liver/lung; tumor amplitudes ∼4-18 mm). 4DDCs for 
two-field plans were performed, with the temporal resolution of the pencil beam 
delivery (4-200 ms) or with 8 phases per breathing cycle (500-1000 ms). For the 
phase-sorting approach, the tumor center motion was used to determine the phase 
assignment of each spot. The dose was calculated either using the full free 
breathing motion or individually repeating each single cycle. Additionally, the 
use of an irregular surrogate signal prior to 4DDC on a repeated cycle was 
simulated. The CTV volume with absolute dose differences >5% (Vdosediff>5%) and 
differences in CTVV95%andD5%-D95%compared to the free breathing scenario were 
evaluated.Main results.Compared to 4DDC considering the full free breathing 
motion with finer spot-wise temporal resolution, 4DDC based on a repeated single 
4DCT resulted inVdosediff>5%of on average 34%, which resulted in an 
overestimation ofV95%up to 24%. However, surrogate based phase-sorting prior to 
4DDC on a single cycle 4DCT, reduced the averageVdosediff>5%to 16% 
(overestimationV95%up to 19%). The 4DDC results were greatly influenced by the 
choice of reference cycle (Vdosediff>5%up to 55%) and differences due to 
temporal resolution were much smaller (Vdosediff>5%up to 10%).Significance.It is 
important to properly consider motion irregularity in 4D dosimetric evaluations 
of PBS proton treatments, as 4DDC based on a single 4DCT can lead to an 
underestimation of motion effects."
712,"The overexpression of membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins (mCRPs) on 
tumour cells helps them survive complement attacks by suppressing 
antibody-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Consequently, mCRP 
overexpression limits monoclonal antibody drug immune efficacy. CD55, an mCRP, 
plays an important role in inhibiting antibody-mediated CDC. However, the 
mechanisms regulating CD55 expression in tumour cells remain unclear. Here, the 
aim was to explore CD55-targeting miRNAs. We previously constructed an in vitro 
model comprising cancer cell lines expressing α-gal and serum containing natural 
antibodies against α-gal and complement. This was used to simulate 
antibody-mediated CDC in colon cancer cells. We screened microRNAs that directly 
target CD55 using LoVo and Ls-174T colon cell lines, which express CD55 at low 
and high levels, respectively. miR-132-3p expression was dramatically lower in 
Ls-174T cells than in LoVo cells. miR-132-3p overexpression or inhibition 
transcriptionally regulated CD55 expression by specifically targeting its mRNA 
3'-untranslated regions. Further, miR-132-3p modulation regulated colon cancer 
cell sensitivity to antibody-mediated CDC through C5a release and C5b-9 
deposition. Moreover, miR-132-3p expression was significantly reduced, whereas 
CD55 expression was increased, in colon cancer tissues compared to levels in 
adjacent normal tissues. CD55 protein levels were negatively correlated with 
miR-132-3p expression in colon cancer tissues. Our results indicate that 
miR-132-3p regulates colon cancer cell sensitivity to antibody-mediated CDC by 
directly targeting CD55. In addition, incubating the LoVo human tumour cell 
line, stably transfected with the xenoantigen α-gal, with human serum containing 
natural antibodies comprises a stable and cheap in vitro model to explore the 
mechanisms underlying antibody-mediated CDC."
713,"Objective. In this work, the irradiation of natural titanium foils in the 
beam-stop of a compact medical cyclotron, an IBA CYCLONE 18/9, is simulated to 
assess the efficacy of using a beam-stop as a target holder, and using two 
different target geometries, in the production of vanadium-48, a 
positron-emitting radioisotope with potential utility as a cancer imaging agent 
in positron emission tomography.Approach. TOPAS, the TOol for PArticle 
Simulation, a Geant4-based Monte Carlo program, was used to model the cyclotron 
beam parameters, choose an appropriate physics list, and simulate the 
irradiation of targets made from foils of 12 or 12.5μm thickness. These 
simulation yields were compared to theoretical yields calculated using cross 
section data from the literature, as well as assayed yields from experimental 
irradiations.Main results.We found that most physics lists in TOPAS overestimate 
the cross section in the desired energy range (16-20 MeV) by at least 136%, with 
the exception of those using the Bertini Cascade Model. Compared to assayed 
yields, TOPAS provided a minimum of 0.4% error for cup-shaped targets and at 
least a 12% overestimation for sphere-shaped targets.Significance.These 
simulations provide a tool to help explain irregularities in radioisotope 
production yield and motivate modifications to increase target yield."
714,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a common malignancy worldwide. Human immune 
deficiency virus type 1 enhancer-binding protein 3 (HIVEP3) was verified to play 
a vital role in types of cancers. However, the functional role of HIVEP3 in AML 
was rarely reported. In this study, CCK-8, colony formation assay, flow 
cytometry, and Trans-well chamber experiments were applied for detecting cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion in AML cells. The expression of proteins 
related to TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway was determined by western blot. Our data 
showed that the expression level of HIVEP3 was closely related to the risk 
classification and prognosis of AML patients. Moreover, HIVEP3 was highly 
expressed in AML patients and cells. Knockdown of HIVEP3 significantly repressed 
cell proliferation invasion, and enhanced cell apoptosis in HL-60 and THP-1 
cells. In addition, HIVEP3 donwreglation could inhibit the TGF-β/Smad signaling 
pathway. TGF-β overexpression could reverse the inhibition effects of HIVEP3 
knockdown on AML development and the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. These 
findings indicated that HIVEP3 contributed to the progression of AML via 
regulating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway and had a prognostic value for AML."
715,"Two-step tests for gene-environment ( G × E ) interactions exploit marginal 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects to improve the power of a 
genome-wide interaction scan. They combine a screening step based on marginal 
effects used to ""bin"" SNPs for weighted hypothesis testing in the second step to 
deliver greater power over single-step tests while preserving the genome-wide 
Type I error. However, the presence of many SNPs with detectable marginal 
effects on the trait of interest can reduce power by ""displacing"" true 
interactions with weaker marginal effects and by adding to the number of tests 
that need to be corrected for multiple testing. We introduce a new 
significance-based allocation into bins for Step-2 G × E testing that overcomes 
the displacement issue and propose a computationally efficient approach to 
account for multiple testing within bins. Simulation results demonstrate that 
these simple improvements can provide substantially greater power than current 
methods under several scenarios. An application to a multistudy collaboration 
for understanding colorectal cancer reveals a G × Sex interaction located near

716,"OBJECTIVE: The Papanicolaou (Pap) smear test is standard screening test that 
detects cervical lesions and cancers. In this multicentric study, we performed a 
retrospective analysis of cytologic results associated with atypical glandular 
cells-not otherwise specified (AGC-NOS).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed Pap smear tests resulted as ""atypical 
glandular cells-not otherwise specified"". A total of 254 women who underwent 
colposcopy due to a Pap smear result of AGC-NOS were included the study between 
2003 and 2021. The ages, Pap smear results, HPV results if any, colposcopic 
biopsy results, endocervical and endometrial pathology results and management of 
these patients were analayzed.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-four patients with AGC-NOS Pap smear result were 
included in the study. A total of 70 (27.6%) patients had cervical and 
endometrial premalignant or malignant lesions. Malignancy was observed in 17 
(6.7%) patients (endometrium; n: 11 (4.3%) and cervix; n: 6 (2.4%)). Isolated 
premalign or malign lesions of cervix and endometrium were detected in 57 
(22.4%) and 12 (4.7%) patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with AGC-NOS should undergo a careful evaluation 
with all its clinicopathological features. Because the cancer of the cervix and 
endometrium is not rare in patients diagnosed with AGC-NOS, colposcopic 
examination with endocervical sampling should be a priority based on a 
cervicovaginal smear. Endometrial sampling is also required according to the 
patient's clinic, age and examination characteristics."
717,"Today, cancer is one of the main health-related challenges, and in the meantime, 
breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women, with an 
alarming number of incidences and deaths every year. For this reason, the 
discovery of novel and more effective approaches for the diagnosis, treatment, 
and monitoring of the disease are very important. In this regard, scientists are 
looking for diagnostic molecules to achieve the above-mentioned goals with 
higher accuracy and specificity. RNA interference (RNAi) is a posttranslational 
regulatory process mediated by microRNA intervention and small interfering RNAs. 
After transcription and edition, these two noncoding RNAs are integrated and 
activated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and AGO2 to connect the 
target mRNA by their complementary sequence and suppress their translation, thus 
reducing the expression of their target genes. These two RNAi categories show 
different patterns in different BC types and stages compared to healthy cells, 
and hence, these molecules have high diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic 
potentials. This article aims to review the RNAi pathway and diagnostic and 
therapeutic potentials with a special focus on BC."
718,"To compare postoperative complications, functional rehabilitation, surgical 
outcomes of the radial artery forearm free flap (RAFFF) and split thickness skin 
graft (STSG) reconstruction of postsurgical defect in T2 lesions of cancer oral 
cavity. Observational Prospective comparative study. Academic tertiary referral 
centre. In our study of forty four patients, after tumour resection, half 
underwent reconstruction using RAFFF (Group I) and another half by STSG (Group 
II). All of the patients were followed postoperatively to determine and compare 
their functional outcomes related to donor site and recipient site 
complications, speech, deglutition and mouth opening. The speech intelligibility 
and deglutition were each assessed using Articulation Handicap Index and 
Vedio-fluoroscopy using the Functional oral intake scale. Operative time for 
STSG reconstruction was shorter at 2.2 ± 0.97 SD hours compared to 5.9 ± 1.24 SD 
hours for RAFFF reconstruction. Hospital stay was 8.3 ± 1.19 SD days for STSG 
patients and 12.6 ± 1.7 SD days for RAFFF patients. The functional outcomes of 
speech quality and swallowing were near comparable in both groups but the donor 
site complications were significant in the RAFFF group. Operative time, hospital 
stay and donor site complications are both significantly reduced with the STSG 
as opposed to RAFF. Functional and oncologic results of both methods are near 
comparable. To conclude, STSG can be used for reconstruction of 
the post-surgical defects in T2 lesions of the tongue."
719,"The National Cancer Institute's Youth Enjoy Science Research Education Program 
(YES) supports cancer-based research experiences, curriculum development and

EYES team also introduced immersive research experiences and mentored curriculum 
development for high school science teachers, a potentially powerful means to 
extend science enrichment and career exposure to schools across Chicago. Ongoing 
evaluation of the EYES program suggests positive outcomes in terms of trainees' 
research skill development and their knowledge about, and positive attitudes 
towards, careers in biomedicine. Teacher research fellows reported that the 
program inspired new insights about science learning and practice that not only 
strengthened their skills as science educators, but also improved their ability 
to relate to their pupils. These findings contribute to the broader effort to 
establish best practices among cancer research training programs, particularly

720,"Patients with chronic lymphocyticleukemia (CLL) typically have innate/adaptive 
immune system dysregulation, thus the protective effect of coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) vaccination remains uncertain. This prospective review evaluates 
vaccination response in these patients, including seropositivity rates by CLL 
treatment status, type of treatment received, and timing of vaccination. 
Antibody persistence, predictors of poor vaccine response, and severity of 
COVID-19 infection in vaccinated patients were also analyzed. Practical advice 
on the clinical management of patients with CLL is provided. Articles reporting 
COVID-19 vaccination in patients with CLL, published January 1, 2021-May 1, 
2022, were included. Patients with CLL displayed the lowest vaccination 
responses among hematologic malignancies; however, seropositivity increased with 
each vaccination. One of the most commonly reported independent risk factors for 
poor vaccine response was active CLL treatment; others included 
hypogammaglobulinemia and age >65-70 years. Patients who were treatment-naive, 
off therapy, in remission, or who had a prior COVID-19 infection displayed the 
greatest responses. Further data are needed on breakthrough infection rates and 
a heterologous booster approach in patients with hematologic malignancies. 
Although vaccine response was poor for patients on active therapy regardless of 
treatment type, CLL management in the context of COVID-19 should aim to avoid 
delays in antileukemic treatment, especially with the advent of numerous 
strategies to mitigate risk of severe COVID-19 such as pre-exposure prophylaxis, 
and highly effective antivirals and monoclonal antibody therapy upon confirmed 
infection. Patients with CLL should remain vigilant in retaining standard 
prevention measures such as masks, social distancing, and hand hygiene."
721,"Cigarette use remains the leading preventable cause of premature mortality in 
the US, with declines in smoking rates slowing in recent years. One promising 
target for improved tobacco control is the expanded regulation of tobacco 
retailers. Evaluations of such policy attempts have largely produced mixed 
results to date. The objective of this study was to the assess the potential of 
using a novel, residentially-focused zoning approach to produce a more targeted 
and equitable reduction in tobacco retailers in high-risk urban settings. We 
focused on Wilmington, Delaware, a city characterized by high poverty rates, a 
majority Black population, a disparate number of tobacco retailers, and an 
elevated smoking prevalence. Through the use of geospatial analyses, we observed 
disproportionately higher counts of convenience store tobacco retailers in 
medium- and high-density residential zones in Wilmington relative to the 
surrounding county. By linking electronic health record (EHR) data from a local 
health care system and US Census Bureau data, we further found that 
approximately 80% of Wilmington smokers and 60% of Wilmington youth lived in 
these residential zones. These findings highlight the potential to more 
equitably reduce tobacco retailer exposure through a residentially-focused 
zoning approach. Tobacco control policy and research implications are 
considered."
722,"Atomic force microscopy (AFM), developed in the early 1980s, has become a 
powerful characterization tool in micro- and nanoscale science. In the early 
1990s, its relevance within biology and medicine research became evident, 
although its incorporation into healthcare applications remains relatively 
limited. Here, we briefly explore the reasons for this low level of 
technological adoption. We also propose a path forward for the incorporation of 
frequency-dependent nanomechanical measurements into integrated healthcare 
strategies that link routine AFM measurements with computer analysis, real-time

would be appropriate for diseases such as cancer, lupus, arteriosclerosis and

723,"Oesophageal neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are rare tumours. Neuroendocrine 
carcinomas (NECs) are the highest grade of NENs, with aggressive biological 
behaviour and poor outcomes. No standardized treatment pathways exist for these 
tumours, with management being individualized based on patient and tumour 
factors. We present five cases, four men and one women between 63 and 68 years 
old, who were diagnosed with symptomatic primary oesophageal NECs. Three were 
diagnosed with localized disease, and two were diagnosed with metastatic 
disease. Endoscopy, biopsy and staging scan results are outlined. Two patients 
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Three patients with localized disease 
underwent oesophagectomy. Two of these patients received neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy. Four patients have succumbed to their disease, with a median 
survival following a diagnosis of 18 months (5-34 months). This case series 
highlights the variability of presentation and stage at diagnosis of oesophageal 
NECs. Multimodal treatment is commonly utilized; however, outcomes are 
universally poor. Further research is required to determine the optimal 
treatment regimen for oesophageal NENS."

725,"Morgagni hernia is a rare form of diaphragmatic hernia. It is located at the 
anterior edge of the diaphragm and does not have an anterior rim. It is 
difficult to achieve a secure closure and maintain the tension of closure with 
laparoscopic surgery. We have performed laparoscopic resection of colorectal 
cancer and hernia repair simultaneously. An 89-year-old woman underwent 
laparoscopic hernia repair and ileocecal resection simultaneously. Regarding 
hernia repair, we considered that it would be difficult to use a mesh from the 
viewpoint of infection due to the colectomy. Therefore, we have done the 
extra-abdominal suture method. After laparoscopic ileocecal resection, a small 
incision was made in the epigastric region, and Morgagni hernia repair was 
performed with extra-abdominal sutures. She had no recurrence of either colon 
cancer or hernia for 22 months post-operatively. The extra-abdominal suture 
method can provide secure closure of the hernia orifice for Morgagni hernia."

727,"OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to examine the provider and organizational factors 
that could be limiting the treatment of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) for Black 
Americans in Texas. Formative research at the provider and organizational level 
will assist in understanding the current facilitators, potential barriers, and 
capacity for OUD treatment for Black Americans.
STUDY DESIGN: Using the exploration phase of the Explore, Preparation, 
Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework, the project will be a formative 
assessment of local factors that influence Medication for OUD (MOUD) treatment 
availability for Black Americans to guide the design of a culturally and locally 
relevant multi-level intervention strategy.
METHODS: and analysis: This project will utilize emergent mixed methods to 
identify and clarify the problems that are obstructing treatment for Black 
patients with OUD. First, the perspectives of individual providers in their 
openness and willingness to provide MOUD treatment to Black Americans diagnosed 
with OUD will be explored through in-depth interviews. The organizational 
capacity factors associated with increased availability to treatment for Black 
American OUD patients will be examined with the organizational leaders using an 
exploratory sequential mixed-methods design. Leader and program managers of 
organizations that provide MOUD will be invited to participate in an online 
survey, with the option to participate in a follow-up in-depth interview. All 
qualitative data from the provider and organization staff interviews will be 
analyzed with a thematic analysis approach. The analysis of the two different 
types of qualitative data will be analyzed together, as a form of triangulation.
CONCLUSIONS: This project will assess the understandings of individual providers 
as well as the organizational-level awareness of the cultural contexts of MOUD 
intervention for Black Americans. This formative research seeks to highlight the 
current status of the opioid crisis in the Black community, and what additional 
supports are needed."
728,"BACKGROUND: In most regions, cancer ranks the second most frequent cause of 
death following cardiovascular disorders.
AIM: In this article, we review the various aspects of glycolysis with a focus 
on types of MCTs and the importance of lactate in cancer cells.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Metabolic changes are one of the first and most 
important alterations in cancer cells. Cancer cells use different pathways to 
survive, energy generation, growth, and proliferation compared to normal cells. 
The increase in glycolysis, which produces substances such as lactate and 
pyruvate, has an important role in metastases and invasion of cancer cells. Two 
important cellular proteins that play a role in the production and transport of 
lactate include lactate dehydrogenase and monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). 
These molecules by their various isoforms and different tissue distribution help 
to escape the immune system and expansion of cancer cells under different 
conditions."
729,"Recent advances in remote-photoplethysmography (rPPG) have enabled the 
measurement of heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), and blood pressure 
(BP) in a fully contactless manner. These techniques are increasingly applied 
clinically given a desire to minimize exposure to individuals with infectious 
symptoms. However, accurate rPPG estimation often leads to heavy loading in 
computation that either limits its real-time capacity or results in a costly 
setup. Additionally, acquiring rPPG while maintaining protective distance would 
require high resolution cameras to ensure adequate pixels coverage for the 
region of interest, increasing computational burden. Here, we propose a 
cost-effective platform capable of the real-time, continuous, multi-subject 
monitoring while maintaining social distancing. The platform is composed of a 
centralized computing unit and multiple low-cost wireless cameras. We 
demonstrate that the central computing unit is able to simultaneously handle 
continuous rPPG monitoring of five subjects with social distancing without 
compromising the frame rate and rPPG accuracy."
730,"The standard therapy for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the administration of 
statins to reduce plasma cholesterol levels, but this requires lifelong 
treatment. We developed a CVD vaccine candidate that targets the 
pro-inflammatory mediator calprotectin by eliciting antibodies against the 
S100A9 protein. The vaccine, based on bacteriophage Qβ virus-like particles 
(VLPs) displaying S100A9 peptide epitopes, was formulated as a slow-release 
PLGA:VLP implant by hot-melt extrusion. The single-dose implant elicited 
S100A9-specific antibody titers comparable to a three-dose injection schedule 
with soluble VLPs. In an animal model of CVD (ApoE-/- mice fed on a high-fat 
diet), the implant reduced serum levels of calprotectin, IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1, 
resulting in less severe aortic lesions. This novel implant was therefore able 
to attenuate atherosclerosis over a sustained period and offers a novel and 
promising strategy to replace the repetitive administration of statins for the 
treatment of CVD."

733,"BACKGROUND: Several studies conducted in Europe have suggested a protective 
association between early-life farming exposures and childhood eczema or atopic 
dermatitis; few studies have examined associations in adults.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate associations between early-life exposures and eczema 
among 3217 adult farmers and farm spouses (mean age 62.8 years) in a 
case-control study nested within an US agricultural cohort.
METHODS: We used sampling-weighted logistic regression to estimate odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for associations between early-life 
exposures and self-reported doctor-diagnosed eczema (273 cases) and polytomous 
logistic regression to estimate ORs (95%CIs) for a 4-level outcome combining 
information on eczema and atopy (specific IgE≥0.35). Additionally, we explored 
genetic and gene-environment associations with eczema.
RESULTS: Although early-life farming exposures were not associated with eczema 
overall, several early-life exposures were associated with a reduced risk of 
having both eczema and atopy. Notably, results suggest stronger protective 
associations among individuals with both eczema and atopy than among those with 
either atopy alone or eczema alone. For example, ORs (95%CIs) for having a 
mother who did farm work while pregnant were 1.01 (0.60-1.69) for eczema alone 
and 0.80 (0.65-0.99) for atopy alone, but 0.54 (0.33-0.80) for having both 
eczema and atopy. A genetic risk score based on previously identified atopic 
dermatitis variants was strongly positively associated with eczema, and 
interaction testing suggested protective effects of several early-life farming 
exposures only in individuals at lower genetic risk.
CONCLUSIONS: In utero and childhood farming exposures are associated with 
decreased odds of having eczema with atopy in adults."
734,"BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BC) treatments are known to be invasive; 
nevertheless, research into the long-term effects is limited and in the context 
of sexual function often male focussed. Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) has been 
reported in up to 75% of female patients. This systematic scoping review 
examines the literature on sexual consequences of BC in female patients.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the evidence on female 
sexual function in BC to identify areas of unmet need and research priorities.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a critical review of PubMed, PsychMed, 
CINAHL, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library in March 2020 according to the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 
extension for Scoping Reviews statement following Levac et al. methodology. 
Identified reports were reviewed according to the Critical Appraisal Skills 
Programme (CASP) criteria. 45 publications were included.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: There was an inconsistent use of patient-reported outcome 
measures (PROMs), with commonly used PROMs having a narrow symptom focus. 
However, common symptoms emerged: loss of desire, orgasmic disorders, vaginal 
dryness, dyspareunia, difficult intromission, reduced clitoral sensation, 
psychological concerns related to diagnosis, fear of contamination and body 
image. Sexual activity was reduced in most groups, despite women expressing a 
motivation to retain sexual function. The degree of symptom distress associated 
with FSD is underreported. Evidence emerged regarding a gap for women in 
clinician counselling and follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The patient's perspective of FSD in BC patients is poorly 
understood and under-addressed in clinical practice. There have been very few 
qualitative studies of FSD in BC. Any intervention designed to address the 
problem must start with greater understanding of both the patients' and 
clinicians' perspective.
LAY SUMMARY: We examined the evidence on sexual consequences of BC in women. It 
is apparent that despite common themes of sexual dysfunction emerging, the 
problem is poorly understood and addressed in clinical practice."
735,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between pre-operative PSA value, 
68Ga-prostate-specific-membrane-antigen (PSMA) PET performance and oncologic 
outcomes after salvage lymph node dissection (sLND) for biochemical recurrent 
prostate cancer (PCa).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 164 patients diagnosed with ≤2 pelvic 
lymph-node recurrence(s) of PCa documented on 68Ga-PSMA PET scan and treated 
with pelvic ± retroperitoneal sLND at 11 high-volume centres between 2012 and 
2019. Pathologic findings were correlated to PSA values at time of sLND, 
categorized in early (<0.5 ng/ml), low (0.5-0.99 ng/ml), moderate (1-1.5 ng/ml) 
and high (>1.5 ng/ml). Clinical recurrence (CR)-free survival after sLND was 
calculated using multivariable analyses and plotted over pre-operative PSA 
value.
RESULTS: Median [interquartile range (IQR)] PSA at sLND was 1.1 (0.6, 2.0) 
ng/ml, and 131 (80%) patients had one positive spot at PET scan. All patients 
received pelvic sLND, whereas 91 (55%) men received also retroperitoneal 
dissection. Median (IQR) number of node removed was 15 (6, 28). The rate of 
positive pathology increased as a function of pre-operative PSA value, with 
highest rates for patients with pre-operative PSA > 1.5 ng/ml (pelvic-only 
sLNDs: 84%; pelvic + retroperitoneal sLNDs: 90%). After sLND, PSA ≤ 0.3 ng/ml 
was detected in 67 (41%) men. On multivariable analyses, pre-operative PSA was 
associated with PSA response (p < 0.0001). There were 51 CRs after sLND. After 
adjusting for confounders, we found a significant, non-linear relationship 
between PSA level at sLND and the 12-month CR-free survival (p < 0.0001), with 
the highest probability of freedom from CR for patients who received sLND at PSA 
level ≥1 ng/ml.
CONCLUSIONS: In case of PET-detected nodal recurrences amenable to sLND, salvage 
surgery was associated with the highest short-term oncologic outcomes when 
performed in men with PSA ≥ 1 ng/ml. Awaiting confirmatory data from prospective 
trials, these findings may help physicians to optimize the timing for 68Ga-PSMA 
PET in biochemical recurrent PCa."
736,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a common malignant subtype of lung cancer 
with high mortality. Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural molecule that regulates 
mitochondrial metabolism. Here, we explored the effect of RSV on NSCLC cell 
mitophagy and paclitaxel (PTX) resistance. LncRNA ZFAS1, miR-150-5p, and 
PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) expressions in NSCLC cells were analyzed 
by RT-qPCR. Levels of PINK1, Parkin and autophagy related molecules LC3I and 
LC3II were assessed by western blot. Mitophagy was demonstrated by transmission 
electron microscopy. Luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-150-5p directly 
interacted with ZFAS1 or PINK1. MTT was performed to test the IC50 of NSCLC 
cells. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured with CCK-8, EdU, and TUNEL 
assays. A549/PTX cells exhibited a higher mitophagy activity, and 
chemoresistance, whereas RSV suppressed PTX resistance and mitophagy in NSCLC 
cells. Furthermore, ZFAS1 was found to be a downstream effector of RSV in NSCLC 
cells. We next found ZFAS1 directly interacted with miR-150-5p and regulated the 
expression of a key mitophagy regulator PINK1. In addition, RSV modulated PTX 
resistance and mitophagy in NSCLC via ZFAS1/miR-150-5p/PINK1 axis. We validate 
that RSV influences mitophagy and PTX resistance in NSCLC via ZFAS1/miR-150-5p 
mediated PINK1/Parkin pathway. Combining these 2 drugs may be a new option of 
NSCLC therapy."
737,"Background: With the increase in the population of cancer patients and the 
importance of reducing the economic burden of disease, it is very important to 
offer solutions that can provide the services needed by this group of patients 
in the most appropriate way. In recent years, palliative care services have been 
provided in a wide range of countries for this purpose, and many studies have 
been conducted to assess its economic and clinical aspects. The current study 
aimed to systematically review economic evaluation studies that investigate the 
costs of end-of-life care for cancer patients. Methods: Electronic search was 
performed in multiple databases and different resources between 2000-2021 based 
on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were Studies consisting 
of a complete EE, including CEA, CUA, and CBA regarding the EE of palliative 
care for patients with cancer disease, EE studies carried out by decision 
analysis models following the EE approach, full-text articles in the English 
language, and published during 2000 and 2021 and According to our search 
strategy, the following articles were removed: studies conducted as a partial EE 
(like those intended to evaluate the effectiveness, cost evaluation, QoL 
evaluation), articles with poor methodological quality based on the CHEERS 
checklist, non-English studies, study protocols, articles presented to a 
conference, and letters to the editor. The quality of the articles was evaluated 
using a CHEERS checklist. Results: 29 studies were included based on inclusion 
criteria. Most articles were published during the past decade. All studies were 
performed in high-income countries (UK= 6 studies, Canada= 5 studies). Most 
studies (n=7) focused on the health sector. Results of quality evaluation showed 
that 10 articles had excellent quality (score higher than 85%). Most studies (27 
out of 29 studies) concluded that palliative medicine interventions were 
cost-effective and yielded positive cost-effectiveness results. 20 studies 
confidently concluded about the costs and benefits of providing palliative care 
services on cost-effectiveness and cost savings, and 2 studies made such a 
conclusion with uncertainty. Therefore, palliative care for cancer patients is 
cost-effective or cost-saving in 85% of studies. Conclusion: Although there are 
a wide variety of studies, characteristics, and quality of the final studies 
included in the present study, there are relatively favorable and stable 
patterns regarding the results. Palliative care is usually less expensive than 
comparator groups, and the cost difference is statistically significant in most 
cases, and this treatment is a relatively cost-effective option. However, making 
the right relevant decision and applying it as a dominant therapy approach in 
different countries requires further study in larger populations and over a 
longer period."

742,"Objective: Primary malignant urethral melanoma is a rare condition, concerning 
less than 1% of melanomas and 4% of all urethral cancers. The early treatment of 
urethral melanoma is extremely important due to the tendency to early 
metastasis. Case report : 88-year-old Caucasian lady presented vaginal bleeding. 
At first Gynaecological examination an urethral caruncle with otherwise normal 
trans-vaginal ultrasound was diagnosed. The patient not reassured asked for a 
second consultation opting to remove the reddish fleshy polypoid lesion 
protruding from the urethra. Histology revealed a urethral amelanotic melanoma. 
The patient underwent an excission of the urethral lesion. Urologist, oncologist 
and gynaecologist at tumor board meeting, considering patient's age and negative 
PET, decided for conservative management with close clinical and imaging 
follow-up.7 months after, vaginal bleeding recurred and a nodule on the anterior 
vaginal wall was detected and biopsied and resulted a pigmented melanoma. The 
patient underwent a wide margin excision. At 10 months follow-up there were no 
evidence of recurrence nor distant metastasis. She started a prophylactic 
immunotherapy with Nivolumab; at her third administration she presented only 
asthenia as side effect. Conclusion: It is importanto to keep in mind the 
urethral amelanotic melanoma to allow an early removal or biopsy, preventing

and BRCA has revolutionized the treatment of DNA repair-deficient cancers. With 
the development of PARP inhibitors, patients displaying germline or somatic

However, a large subset of patients do not respond to PARP inhibitors. 
Furthermore, many of those who do respond eventually acquire resistance. As 
such, combating de novo and acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors remains an 
obstacle in achieving durable responses in patients. In this review, we touch on

single-stranded DNA gap accumulation, as well as address novel approaches for 
overcoming PARP inhibitor resistance."
746,"Multi-nucleotide variants (MNVs) are defined as clusters of two or more nearby 
variants existing on the same haplotype in an individual. Recent studies have 
identified millions of MNVs in human populations, but their functions remain 
largely unknown. Numerous studies have demonstrated that single-nucleotide 
variants could serve as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) by affecting molecular 
phenotypes. Therefore, we propose that MNVs can also affect molecular phenotypes 
by influencing regulatory elements. Using the genotype data from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first identified 223 759 unique MNVs in 33 cancer types. 
Then, to decipher the functions of these MNVs, we investigated the associations 
between MNVs and six molecular phenotypes, including coding gene expression, 
miRNA expression, lncRNA expression, alternative splicing, DNA methylation and 
alternative polyadenylation. As a result, we identified 1 397 821 cis-MNVQTLs 
and 402 381 trans-MNVQTLs. We further performed survival analysis and identified 
46 173 MNVQTLs associated with patient overall survival. We also linked the 
MNVQTLs to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data and identified 119 762 
MNVQTLs that overlap with existing GWAS loci. Finally, we developed 
Pancan-MNVQTLdb (http://gong_lab.hzau.edu.cn/mnvQTLdb/) for data retrieval and 
download. Pancan-MNVQTLdb will help decipher the functions of MNVs in different 
cancer types and be an important resource for genetic and cancer research."
747,"OBJECTIVE: To examine patient characteristics among those who selected the 
long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) and surgical sterilization methods 
at vaginal delivery.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: The National Inpatient Sample.
PATIENTS: A total of 8,013,785 vaginal deliveries from October 2016 to 
December 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: Exposure assignment per LARC (subdermal contraceptive implant 
[implants] or intrauterine device [IUD]) or surgical sterilization (bilateral 
salpingectomy [BS] or bilateral tubal ligation [BTL]) type.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Utilization trends of LARC or surgical sterilization, 
assessed with linear segmented regression with log-transformation, and 
differences in patient characteristics per the exposure strata (implants vs. IUD 
in the LARC group and BS or BTL in the surgical sterilization group), assessed 
using the multivariate binary logistic regression model.
RESULTS: In a comparison between LARC and surgical sterilization, surgical 
sterilization use decreased from 1.90% to 1.55% (18.4% relative decrease), 
whereas LARC use increased from 0.35% to 1.02% (191% relative increase). In the 
LARC group, implant use (from 0.12% to 0.50%) increased more compared with IUD 
use (from 0.22% to 0.52%): relative increase, 317% vs. 136%. In the surgical 
sterilization group, BTL use decreased from 0.66% to 0.18% (72.7% relative 
decrease), whereas BS use was statistically unchanged (from 1.24% to 1.37%). In 
a multivariate analysis, recent year remained an independent characteristic for 
implant use in the LARC group and BS use in the surgical sterilization group. 
Moreover, in both LARC and surgical sterilization strata, procedure choices 
significantly differed on the basis of patient, pregnancy, hospital, and 
delivery factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Immediate postpartum contraception choice has evolved in recent 
years in the United States with an increasing demand for the LARC methods with 
implants at the time of vaginal delivery."
748,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the use of services regarding fertility preservation (FP) 
in cancer patients at a single institution.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Academic medical center.
PATIENTS: A total of 208 FP referrals.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Method of FP; time from referral to FP intervention.
RESULTS: A total of 553 patients were referred to a reproductive specialist for 
FP in the setting of a medical diagnosis from 2011 to 2016. Of these, 208 
patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and met with a reproductive 
specialist. Ninety patients underwent FP services. The average age at referral 
was 30.9 ± 7.9 years. Breast cancer (n=94, 45%) and leukemia/lymphoma (n=62, 
30%) were the most prevalent cancer diagnoses. A 68.9% of patients underwent 
oocyte cryopreservation (n=62), 26.7% underwent embryo cryopreservation (n=24) 
and 4.4% underwent ovarian tissue preservation (n=4). The time interval from the 
referral to the FP intervention ranged from 1 to 810 days, with a median of 17 
days.
CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of a cancer diagnosis, most patients undergoing FP 
intervention underwent oocyte cryopreservation, were <35 years old, and 
underwent FP intervention in <30 days from referral. Whereas FP should ideally 
be initiated at the time of cancer diagnosis, all patients with a cancer 
diagnosis should be referred to a reproductive specialist and counseled on 
options for FP to preserve the optionality for the reproductive future they 
desire."
749,"Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and the death rate of 
lung cancer is much higher than other types of cancers. In recent years, 
numerous novel computer-aided diagnostic techniques with deep learning have been 
designed to detect lung cancer in early stages. However, deep learning models 
are easy to overfit, and the overfitting problem always causes lower 
performance. To solve this problem of lung cancer classification tasks, we 
proposed a hybrid framework called LCGANT. Specifically, our framework contains 
two main parts. The first part is a lung cancer deep convolutional GAN (LCGAN) 
to generate synthetic lung cancer images. The second part is a regularization 
enhanced transfer learning model called VGG-DF to classify lung cancer images 
into three classes. Our framework achieves a result of 99.84% ± 0.156% 
(accuracy), 99.84% ± 0.153% (precision), 99.84% ± 0.156% (sensitivity), and 
99.84% ± 0.156% (F1-score). The result reaches the highest performance of the 
dataset for the lung cancer classification task. The proposed framework resolves 
the overfitting problem for lung cancer classification tasks, and it achieves 
better performance than other state-of-the-art methods."
750,"On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued an opinion in which five justices 
voted to overturn Roe v Wade. Even before the final opinion issued, scholars and 
advocates had begun to consider legal strategies that might mitigate the 
decision's anticipated harmful consequences. One such strategy involves 
challenging state restrictions on Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved 
pregnancy termination drugs on preemption grounds. This article begins by 
exploring how these challenges might fare-considering both drug-specific 
restrictions and complete bans on abortion-arguing that there are compelling 
legal grounds on which courts should conclude that many state restrictions are 
preempted. Importantly, although these state restrictions have arisen within a 
larger debate about reproductive health care, this is far from the only area in 
which states seek to regulate prescription drugs. States have long regulated 
drugs in ways that diverge from FDA, arguably increasingly so in recent years. 
Accordingly, the article investigates the implications that preemption 
challenges in the abortion context may have for other areas of state drug 
regulation, making the case that the benefits of public health federalism need 
not be undermined by successful preemption challenges in the abortion arena."

(CYP) 3A4 inhibitor. Many oral targeted therapies indicated for lung cancer are 
known substrates of CYP 3A4 and concurrent use with Paxlovid may lead to 
potential drug-drug interactions (DDI). The purpose of this review is to 
evaluate the potential DDI between targeted therapies and supportive care for 
lung cancer and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir.
METHODS: A PubMed and FDA drug database search was conducted to identify 
pharmacokinetic data on oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) used in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), both FDA approved and those in development. Metabolism 
pathways for various TKI are extracted, as well as the impact of TKI area under 
the curves and maximum concentration by strong CYP 3A4 inducers and inhibitors 
are summarized. The most common toxicities and supportive care medications for 
the TKI were identified.
RESULTS: Among EGFR inhibitors and exon-20 insertion inhibitors, afatinib is 
least likely to be affected by CYP 3A4, followed by dacomitinib and osimertinib. 
Among ALK inhibitors, alectinib is the least susceptible to CYP 3A4. ROS1 
inhibitors are affected by CYP 3A4 inhibition with the exception of criztonib. 
Among MET inhibitors, capmatinib is substantially affected by CYP 3A4 
inhibition. Drug exposure of RET inhibitors is expected to increase with CYP 3A4 
inhibition, with selpercatinib being the least affected. Certain supportive care 
medications for lung cancer TKI may have significant DDI.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical impact of the DDI between lung cancer TKI and 
ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir vary largely based on the susceptibility of CYP 
3A4 inhibition caused by the antiviral. Close monitoring and medication 
adjustments (i.e., dose changes or alternative COVD-19 therapy) can be employed 
to overcome DDI to ensure patient safety."
752,"To investigate the impact of mono- and di-β-galactose moieties in tumor uptake 
and photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy, HPPH 
[3-(1'-hexyloxy)ethyl-3-devinylpyropheophorobide-a], the meso pyropheophorbide-a 
[3-ethyl-3-devinyl-pyropheophorbide-a], and the corresponding 20-benzoic acid 
analogs were used as starting materials. Reaction of the intermediates 
containing one or two carboxylic acid functionalities with 1-aminogalactose 
afforded the desired 172- or 20(4')- mono- and 172, 20(4')-di galactose 
conjugated photosensitizers (PSs) with and without a carboxylic acid group. The 
overall lipophilicity caused by the presence of galactose in combination with 
either an ethyl or (1'-hexyloxy)ethyl side chain at position-3 of the macrocycle 
made a significant difference in in vitro uptake by tumor cells and 
photoreaction upon light exposure. Interestingly, among the PSs investigated, 
compared to HPPH 1 the carbohydrate conjugates 2 and 11 in which β-galactose 
moieties are conjugated at positions 172 and 20(4') of meso-pyro pheophorbide-a 
showed similar in vitro efficacy in FaDu cell lines, but in SCID mice bearing 
FaDu tumors (head & neck) Ps 11 gave significantly improved long-term tumor 
cure."
753,"""Screening"" is a search for preclinical, asymptomatic disease, including cancer. 
Widespread cancer screening has led to large increases in early-stage cancers 
and pre-cancers. Ubiquitous public messages emphasize the potential benefits to 
screening for these lesions based on the underlying assumption that treating 
cancer at early stages before spread to other organs should make it easier to 
treat and cure, using more tolerable interventions. The intuition is so strong 
that public campaigns are sometimes launched without conducting definitive 
trials directly comparing screening to usual care. An effective cancer screening 
test should not only increase the incidence of early-stage preclinical disease 
but should also decrease the incidence of advanced and metastatic cancer, as 
well as a subsequent decrease in cancer-related mortality. Otherwise, screening 
efforts may be uncovering a reservoir of non-progressive and very slowly 
progressive lesions that were not destined to cause symptoms or suffering during 
the person's remaining natural lifespan: a phenomenon known as ""overdiagnosis."" 
We provide here a qualitative review of cancer overdiagnosis and discuss 
specific examples due to extensive population-based screening, including 
neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and 
breast cancer. The harms of unnecessary diagnosis and cancer therapy call for a 
balanced presentation to people considering undergoing screening, even with a 
test of accepted benefit, with a goal of informed decision-making. We also 
discuss proposed strategies to mitigate the adverse sequelae of overdiagnosis."

759,"The glutamine transporter ASCT2 is highly overexpressed in cancer cells. Block 
of glutamine uptake by ASCT2 is a potential strategy to inhibit growth of cancer 
cells. However, pharmacology of the ASCT2 binding site is not well established. 
In this work, we report the computational docking to the binding site, and the 
synthesis of a new class of ASCT2 inhibitors based on the novel 
L-hydroxyhomoserine scaffold. While these compounds inhibit the ASCT2 leak anion 
conductance, as expected for competitive inhibitors, they did not block leak 
conductance in glutamate transporters (EAAT1-3 and EAAT5). They were also 
ineffective with respect to subtype ASCT1, which has >57% amino acid sequence 
similarity to ASCT2. Molecular docking studies agree very well with the 
experimental results and suggest specific polar interactions in the ASCT2 
binding site. Our findings add to the repertoire of ASCT2 inhibitors and will 
aid in further studies of ASCT2 pharmacology."
760,"BACKGROUND: High-grade gliomas (HGG) with BRAFV600E mutation represent a unique 
subset of central nervous system tumors. Targeted therapies including BRAF and 
MEK inhibitors are now being explored as possible new treatment options.
METHODS: We report an 18-year-old female with a grade 3 pleomorphic 
xanthoastrocytoma treated upfront with dabrafenib and trametinib. We also 
conducted a systematic literature review of patients with HGG and BRAFV600E 
mutations treated with BRAF inhibitors.
RESULTS: Despite local recurrences resected surgically, the patient has been on 
dabrafenib and trametinib for more than 54 months. Thirty-two patients with HGG 
and BRAFV600E mutations treated with BRAF inhibitors were retrieved through our 
systematic review of the literature. Only 1 young patient with an anaplastic 
ganglioglioma was treated upfront with a BRAF inhibitor with a curative intent. 
Best response reported with radiation therapy and systemic therapy was a stable 
disease (SD) for 18 patients (56.3%) and progressive disease (PD) for 9 patients 
(28.1%). Responses to treatment regimens that included BRAF inhibitors were 
reported in 31 patients and included 4 complete responses (12.9%), 23 partial 
responses (74.2%), 2 SDs (6.5%), and 2 PDs (6.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our patient had durable disease control with dabrafenib and 
trametinib. Given favorable responses reported in patients with HGG treated with 
BRAF inhibitors, we believe that upfront targeted therapy is a possible 
treatment approach that should be studied in the context of a clinical trial."
761,"Cancer patients often want information from ""peers"" with the same diagnosis or 
treatment. To increase access to this valuable resource, we developed a website 
to deliver written peer support to cancer patients undergoing stem cell 
transplant. Because little evidence describes how to optimize benefits or reduce 
potential harms of written peer support, we gathered multiple forms of 
stakeholder feedback to inform the website's ethical approach, personalization, 
design, function, and content: a Community Advisory Board; a longitudinal study 
of patients' written peer support needs and motivations; focus groups; 
semi-structured interviews; and usability testing. Findings provide a rich 
foundation for website development."
762,"Bone pain typically occurs immediately following skeletal damage with mechanical 
distortion or rupture of nociceptive fibres. The pain mechanism is also 
associated with chronic pain conditions where the healing process is impaired. 
Any load impacting on the area of the fractured bone will stimulate the 
nociceptive response, necessitating rapid clinical intervention to relieve pain 
associated with the bone damage and appropriate mitigation of any processes 
involved with the loss of bone mass, muscle, and mobility and to prevent death. 
The following review has examined the mechanisms of pain associated with trauma 
or cancer-related skeletal damage focusing on new approaches for the development 
of innovative therapeutic interventions. In particular, the review highlights 
tissue engineering approaches that offer considerable promise in the application 
of functional biomimetic fabrication of bone and nerve tissues. The strategic 
combination of bone and nerve tissue engineered models provides significant 
potential to develop a new class of in vitro platforms, capable of replacing in 
vivo models and testing the safety and efficacy of novel drug treatments aimed 
at the resolution of bone-associated pain. To date, the field of bone pain 
research has centred on animal models, with a paucity of data correlating to the 
human physiological response. This review explores the evident gap in pain drug 
development research and suggests a step change in approach to harness tissue 
engineering technologies to recapitulate the complex pathophysiological 
environment of the damaged bone tissue enabling evaluation of the associated 
pain-mimicking mechanism with significant therapeutic potential therein for 
improved patient quality of life.
GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: Rationale underlying novel drug testing platform 
development. Pain detected by the central nervous system and following bone 
fracture cannot be treated or exclusively alleviated using standardised methods. 
The pain mechanism and specificity/efficacy of pain reduction drugs remain 
poorly understood. In vivo and ex vivo models are not yet able to recapitulate 
the various pain events associated with skeletal damage. In vitro models are 
currently limited by their inability to fully mimic the complex physiological 
mechanisms at play between nervous and skeletal tissue and any disruption in 
pathological states. Robust innovative tissue engineering models are needed to 
better understand pain events and to investigate therapeutic regimes."
763,"The human oral microbiome is associated with chronic diseases including cancer. 
However, our understanding of its relationship with diet is limited. We assessed 
the associations between carbohydrate and glycemic index (GI) with oral 
microbiome composition in 834 non-diabetic subjects from the NCI-PLCO and 
ACS-CPSII cohorts. The oral microbiome was characterized using 16Sv3-4 
rRNA-sequencing from oral mouthwash samples. Daily carbohydrate and GI were 
assessed from food frequency questionnaires. We used linear regression, 
permutational MANOVA, and negative binomial Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to 
test associations of diet with α- and β-diversity and taxon abundance (adjusting 
for age, sex, cohort, BMI, smoking, caloric intake, and alcohol). A q-value 
(FDR-adjusted P-value) of <0.05 was considered significant. Oral bacterial 
α-diversity trended higher in participants in the highest quintiles of 
carbohydrate intake, with marginally increased richness and Shannon diversity 
(p-trend=0.06 and 0.07). Greater carbohydrate intake was associated with greater 
abundance of class Fusobacteriia (q=0.02) and genus Leptotrichia (q=0.01) and 
with lesser abundance of an Actinomyces OTU (q=4.7E-04). Higher GI was 
significantly related to greater abundance of genus Gemella (q=0.001). This 
large, nationwide study provides evidence that diets high in carbohydrates and 
GI may influence the oral microbiome."
764,"OBJECTIVE: Off-protocol prescribing of systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) can 
lead to concerns about effectiveness of patient care. To identify variations in 
practice, a toolkit was developed for health services to address patient safety 
and the risk of sub-optimal outcomes for patients.
DATA SOURCES: Following significant incidents with SACT in South Australia and 
New South Wales, the Department of Health and Human Services, Victoria (the 
department) conducted an assessment of Victorian public health services to 
understand current practice regarding SACT protocol governance. A literature 
review examining SACT auditing was also undertaken to guide improvements. A 
department supported Chemotherapy Audit Toolkit (CAT) was created for 
implementation at public hospitals in Victoria. A post-implementation survey was 
done on uptake and issue identification.
DATA SUMMARY: An initial assessment showed that 27% of Victorian public health 
services were undertaking retrospective review of SACT dosing, which was 
targeted for improvement. The literature review identified little guidance, 
however an audit of current sector practices found several audit methodologies. 
A process that involved audits by health services assessing their own practice 
was adopted. The toolkit was developed and piloted with health services. A 
post-implementation survey showed that 20% of services were using the toolkit, 
35% were implementing the toolkit and 45% did not use the toolkit.
CONCLUSIONS: The VicTAG CAT has been adopted by more than half of Victorian 
public health services and is being used to influence prescribing. 
Implementation of the toolkit has been affected by resource reallocation due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic. The CAT is available online."
765,"Living cells have become ideal therapeutic agents for cancer treatment owing to 
their innate activities, such as efficient tumor targeting and delivery, easy 
engineering, immunomodulatory properties, and fewer adverse effects. However, 
cell agents are often fragile to rigorous tumor microenvironment (TME) and 
limited by inadequate therapeutic responses, leading to unwanted treatment 
efficacy. Cell nanomodification, particularly the cell surface-nanoengineering 
has emerged as reliable and efficient strategy that not only combines cell 
activity properties with nanomaterials but also endows them with extra novel 
functions, enabling to achieve remarkable treatment results. In this review, we 
systematically introduce two major strategies have been adopted to develop cell 
surface engineering with nanomaterials, mainly including living cell 
nano-backpacks and cell membrane-mimicking nanoparticles (NPs). Based on various 
functional NPs and cell types, we focus on reviewing the cell-surface 
nanoengineering for targeted drug delivery, immune microenvironment regulation, 
and precisely antitumor therapy. The advances and challenges of cell 
surface-nanoengineered antitumor agents for cancer therapy applications are 
further discussed in future clinical practice. This review provides an overview 
of the advances in cell surface-engineering for targeting immunoregulation and 
treatment and could contribute to the future of advanced cell-based antitumor 
therapeutic applications. This article is categorized under: Therapeutic

766,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of a 
novel twin-grasper assisted mucosal inverted closure (TAMIC) technique for large 
perforations after gastric endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) in a 
porcine model.
METHODS: Iatrogenic large perforations of stomach were created and closed by an 
experienced endoscopist using TAMIC technique in 12 pigs. Repeat gastroscopy was 
performed in 4 weeks after surgery to examine the wound sites and then the 
animals were sacrificed. The primary outcomes were the successful TAMIC closure 
rate and the complete healing rate. Secondary end points included procedure time 
of TAMIC, complete inverted healing rate, delayed bleeding rate and post-surgery 
perforation. Histologies of the wounds were analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin, 
masson trichrome and immunohistochemistry staining.
RESULTS: The median size of the defects was 3.5 (range 2.5 - 4.5) cm. TAMIC was 
successfully performed in all the 12 pigs. Complete healing was achieved in 11 
pigs 4 weeks after operation as one pig died post-surgery due to severe 
pneumonia. The median procedure time for TAMIC was 39 (range 23 - 81) min. The 
complete inverted healing rate was 45.5% (5/11). No delayed bleeding or 
post-surgery perforation was observed. Histologic analyses showed that both the 
epithelium and muscularis mucosae layers were appropriately connected under 
inverted healing.
CONCLUSIONS: TAMIC is feasible and safe for closure of large perforations after 
gastric EFTR and could be a propagable and promising technique for clinical 
practice."
767,"CONTEXT: Using response to surgery upon tailoring radioiodine (RAI) therapy for 
papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is valued while lacking prospective validation.
OBJECTIVE: To spare RAI thyroid-remnant ablation among intermediate-risk PTCs by 
three-tiered assessments with response to surgery highlighted besides the risk 
of the recurrence stratification and TNM staging.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients with no evidence of disease (NED) 
identified as excellent response (ER) or indeterminate response (IDR) to surgery 
were spared from RAI thyroid-remnant ablation after informed consent and 
prospectively enrolled under active surveillance. Those involved in other trials 
or without sufficient follow-up data were excluded. Dynamic responses were 
followed and compared longitudinally.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: NED presenting as durable ER or IDR for over 12 months.
RESULTS: Of the enrolled 215 patients, 47.4% (102/215) ER and 52.6% (113/215) 
IDR were identified upon RAI decision-making. After a median of 23.6 (IQR 
13.8-31.6) months, the share of ER increased to 82.8%(178/215) and IDR decreased 
to 16.3% (35/215), with 85 patients shifting from IDR to ER over time, only 0.5% 
(1/215) structural and 0.5% (1/215) biochemical incomplete response observed. 
Successful remnant ablation was observed in 27.7%(26/94) of the patients 
completing two diagnostic whole-body scannings after a median interval of 13.0 
months, indicating a theranostic effect. In the 173 patients followed for over 
12 months, the NED rate didn't differ between ER and IDR subgroups (100% vs. 
97.9%, P = 0.20).
CONCLUSIONS: Through the three-tiered assessments with response to surgery 
highlighted, postoperative ER and IDR spared from RAI remnant ablation may 
indicate similar favorable responses in intermediate-risk PTC patients during 
23.6 months follow-up."
768,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is the second most common 
malignancy in the Caucasian population. A minority of cases are inoperable at 
presentation, recur or develop metastatic disease with a historical 5-year 
overall survival of ~10%. Treatment options in this setting are generally 
palliative. Immunotherapy has emerged as a new paradigm in managing these 
patients.
METHODS: Patients presenting to Sydney West Cancer Network with locally advanced 
or metastatic CSCC treated with the anti-PD1 agent cemiplimab were identified. 
Response to treatment was objectively assessed based on RECIST1.1 or PERCIST 
criteria. Primary end point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end 
points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), therapy 
toxicity, and predictors of treatment response.
RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were identified with a median age of 76 (range 
56-94) and 4 immunosuppressed. The longest follow up duration was 28 months. 
ORR, complete response (CR), and partial response (PR) were 68% (13/19), 53% 
(10/19), and 16% (3/19), respectively. Median PFS was 12 months (95% CI 9-14) 
whilst median OS was not reached by end of study. Responders (CR or PR) had 
significantly superior OS compared to those with no response (P < 0.01). A 
primary site of head and neck cancer was significantly associated with ORR 
(P = 0.04). A single patient experienced Grade 3 toxicity with the rest being 
Grades 0-1.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms the clinical efficacy of cemiplimab in patients 
with advanced CSCC with many experiencing a durable response and an acceptable 
adverse effect profile."
769,"BACKGROUND: Pelvic exenteration surgery is complex, necessitating co-ordinated 
multidisciplinary input and improved referral pathways. A state-wide pelvic 
exenteration multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting was established in SA and the 
outcomes of this were audited and compared with historical data.
METHODS: All patients referred for discussion between August 2021 and July 2022 
to the SA State-wide Pelvic Exenteration MDT were included in this study. MDT 
discussion centred around disease resectability, risk versus benefit of surgery, 
and need for local or interstate referral. Prospective data collection included 
patient demographics and MDT recommendations of surgery, palliation, or 
referral. Patients referred for surgery locally or interstate were compared with 
a retrospective patient cohort treated previously between January and December 
2020.
RESULTS: Over 12 months, 91 patients were discussed (including nine multiple 
times), by a mean of 18 meeting participants each month. Forty-eight patients 
(58.5%) had primary malignancy, 25 (30.5%) recurrent malignancy, and 9 (11.0%) 
had non-malignant disease. Colorectal cancer was the most common presentation 
(56.1%), followed by gynaecological (30.5%) and urological (6.1%) malignancy. 
Pelvic exenteration surgery was recommended to be performed locally in 53.7% of 
patients and the remainder for non-surgical treatment, palliation, or 
re-discussion. During this time, 44 patients underwent surgery locally (versus 
34 in 2020) and only 4 referred interstate (versus 8 in 2020).
CONCLUSION: The establishment of a dedicated state-wide pelvic exenteration MDT 
has resulted in better coordination of care for patients with locally advanced 
pelvic malignancy in SA, and significantly reduced the need for interstate 
referral."
770,"PURPOSE: Delirium presents a significant healthcare burden. It complicates 
post-operative care in up to 50% of cardiac surgical patients with worse 
outcomes, longer hospital stays and higher cost of care. Moreover, the nature of 
delirium following cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) remains 
unclear, the underlying pathobiology is poorly understood, status quo diagnostic 
methods are subjective, and diagnostic biomarkers are currently lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To identify diagnostic biomarkers of delirium and for insights into 
possible neuronal pathomechanisms.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Comparative proteomic analyses were performed on plasma 
samples from a nested matched cohort of patients who underwent cardiac surgery. 
Validation by targeted proteomics was performed in an independent set of 
samples. Biomarkers were assessed for biological functions and diagnostic 
accuracy.
RESULTS: 47% of subjects demonstrated delirium. Of 3803 proteins identified from 
patient samples by multiplexed quantitative proteomics, 16 were identified as 
signatures of exposure to CPB, and 11 biomarkers distinguished delirium cases 
from non-cases (AuROC = 93%). Notable among these biomarkers are C-reactive 
protein, serum amyloid A-1 and cathepsin-B.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The interplay of systemic and central 
inflammatory markers sheds new light on delirium pathogenesis. This work 
suggests that accurate identification of cases may be achievable using panels of 
biomarkers. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
771,"Background: Mass screening of high-risk populations for oral cancer has proven 
to be effective in reducing oral cancer mortality. However, the magnitude of the 
effectiveness of the various screening scenarios has rarely been addressed. 
Methods: We developed a simulation algorithm for a prospective cohort under 
various oral cancer screening scenarios. A hypothetical cohort of 8 million 
participants aged ≥30 years with cigaret smoking and/or betel quid chewing 
habits was constructed based on parameters extracted from studies on oral cancer 
screening. The results of a population-based screening program in Taiwan and a 
randomized controlled trial in India were used to validate the fitness; then, 
the effectiveness of the model was determined by changing the screening 
parameters. Results: There was a reduction in the risk of advanced oral cancer 
by 40% (relative risk [RR] = 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.59-0.62) and 
oral cancer mortality by 29% (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.69-0.73) at the 6-year 
follow-up in a screening scenario similar to the biennial screening in Taiwan, 
with a 55.1% attendance rate and 92.6% referral rate. The incremental effect in 
reducing advanced oral cancer was approximately 5% with a short 1-year screening 
frequency, and the corresponding reduction in mortality was, on average, 6.5%. 
The incremental reduction in advanced oral cancer per 10% increase in the 
compliance rate was 3% to 4%, while only 1% to 2% reduction was noted per 10% 
increase in the referral rate. The effectiveness of screening in reducing 
advanced oral cancer was 5% to 6% less when both betel quid chewing and alcohol 
drinking habits were present. Conclusion: Our computer simulation model 
demonstrated the effect of screening on the reduction in oral cancer mortality 
under various scenarios. The results provide screening policymakers with the 
necessary guidance to implement screening programs to save lives."
772,"Purpose: We aimed to investigate the dose calculation accuracy of Mobius3D for 
small-field flattening-filter-free x-rays, mainly utilized for stereotactic body 
radiation therapy (SBRT). The accuracy of beam modeling and multileaf collimator 
(MLC) modeling in Mobius3D, significantly affecting the dose calculation is 
investigated. Methods: The commissioning procedures of Mobius3D were performed 
for unflattened 6 MV and 10 MV x-ray beams of the linear accelerator, including 
beam model adjustment and dosimetric leaf gap (DLG) optimization. An 
experimental study with artificial plans was conducted to evaluate the accuracy 
of small-field modeling. The dose calculation accuracy of Mobius3D was also 
evaluated for retrospective SBRT plans with multiple targets. Results: Both 
studies evaluated the dose calculation accuracy through comparisons with the 
measured data. Relatively large differences were observed for off-axis distances 
over 5 cm and for small fields less than 1 cm field size. For the study with 
artificial plans, the maximum absolute error of 9.96% for unflattened 6 MV and 
9.07% for unflattened 10 MV was observed when the field size was 1 cm. For the 
study with patient plans, the mean gamma passing rate with 3%/3 mm gamma 
criterion was 63.6% for unflattened 6 MV and 82.6% for unflattened 10 MV. The 
maximum of the average dose difference was -19.9% for unflattened 6MV and -10.1% 
for unflattened 10MV. Conclusions: The dose calculation accuracy uncertainties 
of Mobius3D for small-field flattening-filter-free photon beams were observed. 
The study results indicated that the beam and MLC modeling of Mobius3D must be 
improved for use in SBRT pretreatment QA in clinical practice."
773,"Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitors have been clinically 
developed to treat acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but their application is 
limited by the possibility of drug resistance, which is reportedly associated 
with the activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway. Meanwhile, homoharringtonine 
(HHT), a classic antileukemia drug, possibly inhibits the WNT/β-catenin pathway. 
In this study, we attempted to combine a novel BRD4 inhibitor (ACC010) and HHT 
to explore their synergistic lethal effects in treating AML. Here, we found that 
co-treatment with ACC010 and HHT synergistically inhibited cell proliferation, 
induced apoptosis and arrested the cell cycle in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 
3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)-positive AML cells in vitro, and 
significantly inhibiting AML progression in vivo. Mechanistically, ACC010 and 
HHT cooperatively downregulated MYC and inhibited FLT3 activation. Further, when 
HHT was added, ACC010-resistant cells demonstrated a good synergy. We also 
extended our study to the mouse BaF3 cell line with FLT3-inhibitor-resistant 
FLT3-ITD/tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations and AML cells without FLT3-ITD. 
Collectively, our results suggested that the combination treatment of ACC010 and 
HHT might be a promising strategy for AML patients, especially those carrying 
FLT3-ITD."
774,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are functional RNAs in the development and metabolism 
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therein, this paper particularly 
elucidated the circRNA SEC61 subunit alpha isoform 1 (circSEC61A1) in NSCLC has 
not been fully elucidated. Clinical analysis of circSEC61A1 expression was 
performed on specimens collected from 51 patients with primary NSCLC, together 
with patients' survival. Cell experiments were performed after interfering with 
circSEC61A1, microRNA (miR)-513a-5p, and peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 (PEX5) 
expression, respectively, and cell malignant phenotypes and aerobic glycolysis 
were evaluated, as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related 
markers and Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Xenografts experiments studied the 
performance of circSEC61A1 in vivo. The downstream molecules of circSEC61A1 were 
searched. Our data demonstrated that circSEC61A1 was upregulated in NSCLC 
patients, showing an association with poorer survival outcomes. In cell 
experiments, circSEC61A1 overexpression promoted NSCLC malignant phenotypes, 
glycolysis, EMT, and Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, whereas circSEC61A1 
underexpression did the opposite. Knockdown of circSEC61A1 limited tumor growth 
and metastasis. Furthermore, circSEC61A1 could regulate PEX5 expression through 
competitive absorption of miR-513a-5p. Generally, circSEC61A1 is a potential 
biomarker for NSCLC, and circSEC61A1 serves tumor-promoting action in the 
progression of NSCLC."
775,"Skin cancer, the most prevalent cancer in Caucasians residing at low latitudes, 
can primarily be prevented by avoiding over-exposure to sunlight. Serial 
cross-sectional observations were conducted at an outdoor motorsport event held 
in Townsville, Queensland each July (Southern winter) to determine whether 
sun-protection habits changed over time. Most (71.1%) of the 1,337 attendees 
observed (97.6% lightly-pigmented skin, 64.0% male) wore a hat (any style 
shading the face), while few (18.5%) wore three-quarter or full-length sleeves. 
While hat-wearing rates (any style) were similar in 2009 (326, 72.6%) and 2013 
(625, 70.4%), the use of sun-protective styles 
(wide-brimmed/bucket/legionnaires) decreased from 29.2% to 18.6% over the same 
period, primarily because the use of sun-protective hats halved (from 28.7% to 
14.0%) among females, while decreasing from 29.4% to 21.1% in males. Although 
relatively few individuals wore sun-protective (three-quarter-length or 
full-length) sleeves regardless of year (OR=0.117, P<0.0001), encouragingly, the 
use of sun-protective sleeves more than doubled between 2009 (10.5%) and 2013 
(22.5%). Interestingly females, albeit the minority, at this sporting event were 
less likely to wear a hat (OR=0.473, P<0.0001) than males. These findings 
highlight the need for continued momentum toward skin cancer primary prevention 
through sun-protection with a dedicated focus on outdoor sporting settings."
776,"BACKGROUND: The complex metabolic profile of tamoxifen anticancer drug and 
polymorphism in its metabolizing enzymes particularly CYP2D6 contribute to the 
high-observed inter-individual variability in its main active metabolite 
endoxifen. Therapeutic drug monitoring of endoxifen may play a key role in 
optimizing tamoxifen therapy, and control of both adverse effects and cancer 
recurrence. This pilot study aims to assess the clinical benefits of applying 
endoxifen measurement during tamoxifen therapy in patients with breast cancer.
METHODS: Adult premenopausal breast cancer patients ≥ 18 years who received 
tamoxifen at a fixed dose of 20 mg daily were included. The primary endpoint was 
to identify the inter-subject variability in serum concentration of the drug and 
its metabolites especially endoxifen, through fixation of the tamoxifen dose. 
The secondary endpoint was to check the correlation between endoxifen metabolite 
concentration and the development of tamoxifen's adverse effects and cancer 
recurrence.
RESULTS: Sixty patients were included in the study with a mean age of 
38.4  ±  0.6 years (range: 26-50). The mean concentration of tamoxifen and 
endoxifen was 181  ±  9.6 ng/mL and 31.49 ng/mL, respectively. The 
inter-individual variability in concentrations for the drug and its active 
metabolite as estimated by the coefficient of variation percentage was in 41% 
and 31%, respectively. Cancer recurrence was observed in a group of patients 
(n  =  16) with an average endoxifen level of 24.48 ng/mL. Another group of 
patients (n  =  25) developed different tamoxifen adverse effects including hot 
flashes, vaginal bleeding, endometrial thickness, and ovarian cysts with the 
average endoxifen level of 38.61 ng/mL. The rest of the patients (n  =  19) who 
responded smoothly to the drug with no complications had an average endoxifen 
level of 31.37 ng/mL. Analysis of variance test showed a significant difference 
in endoxifen levels between the three groups (p  =  0.002).
CONCLUSION: The measurement of the endoxifen active metabolite of tamoxifen in 
breast cancer patients can help dose optimization in light of the observed wide 
inter-individual variability in drug fixed-dose related concentration of the 
metabolite. Monitoring of serum concentration of endoxifen can help to reveal, 
reduce and control tamoxifen's adverse effects and cancer recurrence."
777,"INTRODUCTION: Low back pain (LBP) is the top health condition requiring 
rehabilitation in the United States. The financial burden of managing LBP is 
also amongst the highest in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines 
(CPGs) provide management recommendations and have the potential to lower health 
costs. Limited evidence exists on the impact of CPG implementation on downstream 
medical costs.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of CPG implementation in physical therapist 
(PT) practice on direct and downstream costs for patients with LBP.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study examined billing data from 270 
patients with LBP who were treated at multiple sites within one large academic 
medical center by PTs who participated in a multifaceted CPG implementation 
program. Costs were analyzed for direct PT services, downstream medical 
services, and PT utilization from September 2017 to March 2018 
(pre-implementation group) and compared with costs from June 2018 to December 
2018 (post-implementation group).
RESULTS: Direct PT costs were significantly lower post-implementation than 
pre-implementation mean: $2,863 USD (SD: $1,968) vs. $3,459 USD (SD: $2,838), p 
= .05, 95% CI [11, 1182]. All downstream costs were lower post-implementation 
with statistically significant lower costs found in downstream imaging: p = .04, 
95% CI [32, 1,905]; pharmacy: p = .03, 95% CI [70, 1,217]; surgery: p = .03, 95% 
CI [446, 9,152], and ""other"": p = .02, 95% CI [627, 7,920].
CONCLUSION: Implementing the LBP CPG in outpatient PT practice can have a 
positive impact on lowering downstream costs and the potential to increase the 
value of PT services."
778,"AIM: Bridge to surgery (BtS) aims to decrease perioperative morbidity and 
mortality in emergency resections (ER) of the colon. Previous results are 
inconsistent, and long-term comparisons are scarce. This study aimed to compare 
the short- and long-term outcomes of BtS and ER.
METHOD: This retrospective study examined data from the Swedish Colorectal 
Cancer Registry on patients treated for acute malignant large bowel obstruction 
from 2007 to 2009. Patients were grouped by treatment strategy: BtS (using 
self-expanding metallic stent or diverting stoma) or ER. Medical records were 
scrutinized for all patients in the BtS group. The primary endpoints were 5-year 
overall survival (OS) and 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS). The secondary 
endpoints were post-operative mortality and morbidity rates and stoma 
permanence.
RESULTS: Overall, 143 patients were treated using BtS versus 1,302 patients 
treated with ER. The 5-year OS was higher in the BtS group than in the ER group 
(53.8% vs. 37.4%; P<0.05). No difference was noted in the 3-year RFS (75.7% vs. 
75.0%; P=0.38). The post-operative mortality rate was lower in the BtS group 
than in the ER group (0.7% vs. 7.3%; P<0.05). Complications occurred in 46.9% of 
patients in the BtS group (both procedures) versus 35.9% of patients in the ER 
group (P<0.05) whereas the rate of severe complications was 23.1% and 16.9% 
respectively (p=0.07).
CONCLUSION: This retrospective population-based registry study showed higher 
long-term survival and lower post-operative mortality rates among patients 
treated with BtS versus ER for acute malignant large bowel obstruction."
779,"Hematological malignancies encompass a wide variety of severe diseases that pose 
a serious threat to human health. Given the fact that hematological malignancies 
are difficult to treat due to their unpredictable and rapid deterioration and 
high rates of recurrence, growing attention has been paid to their early 
screening and diagnosis. However, developing a rapid and effective diagnostic 
tool featuring a noninvasive sampling technique is still extremely challenging. 
In recent years, novel nanomaterials-based electrochemical biosensors have 
attracted great interest because of such advantages as simple operation, low 
cost, fast response, etc. As a kind of rising nanomaterials, two-dimensional 
materials have excellent electronic and chemical properties, which have been 
proven to improve the performance of electrochemical biosensors. This review 
summarizes the applications of different types of electrochemical biosensors 
(nucleic acid sensors, immunosensors, aptamer biosensors, and cytosensors) based 
on two-dimensional materials in the detection of biological molecules related to 
hematological malignancies. Two-dimensional materials-based electrochemical 
biosensors designed for the diagnosis of leukemia could rapidly detect the 
target biomolecules at a trace level and show great merits such as wide linear 
range, low detection limit, high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and 
cost-effectiveness. In addition, these biosensors have also achieved 
satisfactory results in the diagnosis of lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Thus, 
two-dimensional materials-based electrochemical biosensors are attractive for 
the early diagnosis of hematological malignancies in clinical practice. 
Nevertheless, more efforts are still required to further improve the performance 
of electrochemical biosensors. In this review, we propose the possible main 
concerns in the design of future two-dimensional materials-based electrochemical 
biosensors, involving the development of sensors for synchronous detection of 
diverse target biomolecules, the exploration of other superior two-dimensional 
materials, the simplification of the sensors fabrication process, the 
construction of new hybrid structures and how to avoid possible environmental 
issues."
780,"Cancer is a major threat to human health today. Although the existing anticancer 
treatments have effectively improved the prognosis of some patients, there are 
still other patients who cannot benefit from these well-established strategies. 
Reprogramming of lipid metabolism is one of the typical features of cancers. 
Recent studies have revealed that key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism may 
be effective anticancer therapeutic targets, but the development of therapeutic 
lipid metabolism targets is still insufficient. ECHS1 (enoyl-CoA hydratase, 
short chain 1) is a key enzyme mediating the hydration process of mitochondrial 
fatty acid β-oxidation and has been observed to be abnormally expressed in a 
variety of cancers. Therefore, with ECHS1 and cancer as the main keywords, we 
searched the relevant studies of ECHS1 in the field of cancer in Pubmed, 
summarized the research status and functions of ECHS1 in different cancer 
contexts, and explored its potential regulatory mechanisms, with a view to 
finding new therapeutic targets for anti-metabolic therapy. By reviewing and 
summarizing the retrieved literatures, we found that ECHS1 regulates malignant 
biological behaviors such as cell proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis, 
autophagy, and drug resistance by remodeling lipid metabolism and regulating 
intercellular oncogenic signaling pathways. Not only that, ECHS1 exhibits early 
diagnostic and prognostic value in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and 
small-molecule inhibitors that regulate ECHS1 also show therapeutic significance 
in preclinical studies. Taken together, we propose that ECHS1 has the potential 
to serve as a therapeutic target of lipid metabolism."

783,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the results and 
complications in patients who had low-grade chondrosarcomas in the appendicular 
skeleton and were treated by intralesional curettage and cementation within the 
scope of 25 years of experience in a single center.
METHODS: Ninety-one patients (72 female and 19 male) were retrospectively 
analyzed. The median at the time of surgery was 43 (17-78) years, and the median 
follow-up was 102 (26-288) months. All patients were treated by intralesional 
curettage followed by cementation with high-viscosity bone cement 
(polymethylmethacrylate). Complications and local recurrence rates, as well as 
clinical outcome scores were recorded.
RESULTS: Five patients (5.49%) developed local recurrence at an average of 6.6 
(6-9) months postoperatively. Four were treated with local wide excision and 
reconstruction with tumor prosthesis. One patient received recurettage and 
cementation. Two recurred patients were dedifferentiated into grade II 
chondrosarcomas in the last intervention. No major postoperative complication 
was identified in the series. Patients achieved an average Musculoskeletal Tumor 
Society scoring system of 92.4% (standard deviation 5.2; range 80-100) in the 
sixth postoperative month. Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scores in the recurrent 
patients decreased from an average of 90% to 75.3% after the final intervention.
CONCLUSION: Intralesional curettage and cementation seem safe and reliable 
techniques with low recurrence and complication rates in treating low-grade 
chondrosarcomas of the appendicular skeleton. Clinical, radiological, and 
pathological evaluations are mandatory before surgical intervention, and a 
multidisciplinary approach is crucial. A strict follow-up regimen in the early 
postoperative period is needed and strongly recommended to detect local 
recurrence.

784,"BACKGROUND: Although men of African ancestry (AA) have the highest mortality 
rate from prostate cancer (PCa), relatively little is known about the germline 
variants that are associated with PCa risk in AA men. The goal of this study is 
to systematically evaluate rare, recurrent nonsynonymous variants across the 
exome for their association with PCa in AA men.
METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) of germline DNA in two AA PCa patient 
cohorts of Johns Hopkins Hospital (N = 960) and Wayne State University (N = 747) 
was performed. All nonsynonymous variants present in both case cohorts, with a 
carrier rate between 0.5% and 1%, were identified. Their carrier rates were 
compared with rates from 8128 African/African American (AFR) control subjects 
from The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) using Fisher's exact test. 
Significant variants, defined as false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted 
p-value ≤ 0.05, were further evaluated in AA PCa cases (N = 132) and controls 
(N = 1184) from the UK Biobank (UKB).
RESULTS: Two variants reached a pre-specified statistical significance level. 
The first was p.R14Q in GPRC5C (found in 0.47% of PCa cases and 0.01% of 
population controls); odds ratio (OR) for PCa was 37.46 (95% confidence interval 
CI 4.68-299.72), pexact  = 7.01E-06, FDR-adjusted p-value = 0.05. The second was 
p.R511Q in IGF1R (found in 0.53% of PCa cases and 0.01% of population controls); 
OR for PCa was 21.54 (95%CI 4.65-99.76), pexact  = 5.51E-06, FDR-adjusted 
p-value = 0.05. The mean percentage of African ancestry was similar between 
variant carriers and noncarriers of each variant, p > 0.05. In the UKB AA men, 
GPRC5C R14Q was 0.76% and 0.08% in cases and controls, respectively, OR for PCa 
was 9.00 (95%CI 0.56-145.23), pexact  = 0.19. However, IGF1R R511Q was not found 
in cases or controls.
CONCLUSIONS: This WES study identified two rare, recurrent nonsynonymous PCa 
risk-associated variants in AA. Confirmation in additional large populations of 
AA PCa cases and controls is required."
785,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated whether sublobar resection (sub-L) is 
non-inferior to lobectomy (L) for stage I (T1-T2aN0M0) small cell lung cancer 
(SCLC) regarding long-term overall survival (OS).
METHODS: Clinicopathological and prognostic data of patients with stage I 
(pT1-T2aN0M0) SCLC were retrieved. Kaplan-Meier curves and Breslow tests were 
performed for the assessment of OS. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was 
used to mediate the inherent bias of retrospective researches.
RESULTS: A total of 188 patients with stage I SCLC were included in this study 
after PSM. For resected stage I SCLC, surgery plus adjuvant therapy was related 
to a better OS compared with surgery only (p = 0.016). For resected stage I 
SCLC, no matter adjuvant therapy was performed or not, no significant difference 
was observed in long-term OS between the L and sub-L groups (p = 0.181). Further 
subgroup analysis demonstrated that the OS disadvantage of sub-L over L was not 
statistically significant for stage I SCLC patients underwent surgery only 
(p = 0.653), but also for the patients underwent surgery plus adjuvant therapy 
(p = 0.069). Moreover, in the subgroup analyses according to TNM stage (IA and 
IB), sex (male and female), and age (≥70 and <70 years), OS did not differ 
between the L and sub-L groups except in female patients (p = 0.008). 
Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that adjuvant therapy was 
positively associated with OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgery plus adjuvant therapy confers a better survival benefit 
than surgery only for stage I SCLC patients. However, as far as the range of 
surgical resection is concerned, sublobar resection may be non-inferior to 
lobectomy regarding OS. Our study could conduce to the development of optimal 
therapeutic strategies for stage I SCLC patients. Further validation is 
warranted in larger retrospective and prospective cohort studies."
786,"Vaccination and natural infection both elicit potent humoral responses that 
provide protection from subsequent infections. The immune-history of an 
individual following such exposures is in part encoded by antibodies. While 
there are multiple immunoassays for measuring antibody responses, the majority 
of these methods measure responses to a single antigen. A commonly used method 
for measuring antibody responses is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) - a semi-quantitative assay that is simple to perform in research and 
clinical settings. Here, we present FLU-LISA (fluorescence-linked immunosorbent 
assay) - a novel antigen microarray based assay for rapid high-throughput 
antibody profiling. The assay can be used for profiling IgG, IgA and IgM 
responses to multiple antigens simultaneously, requiring minimal amounts of 
sample and antigens. Using several influenza and SARS-CoV-2 antigen microarrays, 
we demonstrated the specificity and sensitivity of our novel assay and compared 
it to the traditional ELISA, using samples from mice, chickens and humans. We 
also showed that our assay can be readily used with dried blood spots, which can 
be collected from humans and wild birds. The FLU-LISA can be readily used to 
profile hundreds of samples against dozens of antigens in a single day, and 
therefore offers an attractive alternative to the traditional ELISA."
787,"BACKGROUND: Cisplatin, a first-generation platinum agent, is used for managing 
various cancers and is associated with dose-dependent side effects of hearing 
impairment and tinnitus. However, the safety of high-dose cisplatin in hearing 
impairment, has not been fully investigated in Japan.
METHODS: We performed pure-tone threshold audiometry before and every 3-4 weeks 
after chemotherapy for patients receiving cisplatin-containing chemotherapy 
between April 2015 and October 2017 at Kobe Minimally Invasive Cancer Center. 
Hearing impairment was evaluated prospectively using the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.
RESULTS: We enrolled 100 patients and analyzed 96 patients for whom 
post-chemotherapy audiometry could be performed. The median patient age was 
65 years, and most patients were male (75). The cancer types were as follows: 
esophageal, 36; head and neck, 35; lung, 23; and gastric, 2. Cisplatin 
monotherapy and combination therapy were administered to 33 and 63 patients, 
respectively. A single cisplatin dose was 60-100 mg/m2 ; the median number of 
doses and total dose were 3 and 240 mg/m2 , respectively. Additionally, 78 and 
18 patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy and chemotherapy 
alone, respectively. Twenty-seven patients had grade 2 or higher hearing 
impairment. Furthermore, the prevalence was significantly higher in patients 
receiving a total dose of ≥300 mg/m2 . Twenty and 32 patients were aware of 
deafness and tinnitus, respectively.
CONCLUSION: No patient discontinued treatment owing to hearing impairment. The 
total cisplatin dose was considered related to post-treatment hearing impairment 
frequency in Japanese patients. However, routine audiometric monitoring is 
recommended during high-dose cisplatin-based chemotherapy."
788,"BACKGROUND: Enrichment of urinary exfoliated tumor cells (UETCs) is a 
noninvasive way of bladder cancer diagnosis, but the lack of specific capture 
and identification of tumor cells from the urine remains a limitation that 
impedes the development of liquid biopsy.
METHODS: The CytoBot® 2000, a novel circulating cell isolation and enrichment 
platform, was used for UETCs isolation after comprehensive optimization. The 
commercial cell lines of bladder cancer were used in spiking assay for cell 
recovery test. The flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining assays were 
performed for expression validation of capture target and identification 
markers. The performance of optimized platform was validated by 159 clinical 
samples and analyzed using receiver operator characteristic curve.
RESULTS: The chip that had a pore diameter of 15*20 μm could reduce the 
background residues while maintaining a higher cell recovery rate. We found that 
the cell capture ability of chip significantly improved after anti-EpCam 
antibody encapsulation, but not with T4L6FM1. In identification system 
optimization, the spiking assay and validation of clinical sample showed that 
the performance of CK20 and DBC-1 were better that pan-CK in tumor cell 
identification, in addition, the staining quality is more legible with CK20.
CONCLUSION: The optimized capture chip is more specific for UETCs isolation. 
CK20 and DBC-1 are both sensitive biomarkers of UETCs in bladder cancer 
diagnosis. The performance of this optimized platform is excellent in clinical 
test that improves the accuracy of urine cell testing and provides a new 
alternative for the clinical application of BLCA liquid biopsy assessment."
789,"N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) is the most abundant nucleotide modification observed 
in eukaryotic mRNA. Changes in m 6 A levels in transcriptome are tightly 
correlated to expression levels of m 6 A methyltransferases and demethylases. 
Abnormal expression levels of methyltransferases and demethylases are observed 
in various diseases and health conditions such as cancer, male infertility, and 
obesity. This research explores the efficacy of m 6 A-modified RNA as an 
anticancer drug target. We discovered a 12-mer peptide that binds specifically 
to m6A-modified RNA using phage display experiments. Our fluorescence-based 
assays illustrate the selected peptide binds to methylated RNA with lower 
micromolar affinity and inhibit the binding of protein FTO, a demethylase enzyme 
specific to m 6 A modification. When cancer cell lines were treated with mtp1, 
it led to an increase in m 6 A levels and a decrease in cell viability. Hence 
our results illustrate the potential of mtp1 to be developed as a drug for 
cancer."
790,"Lung carcinoma is the primary reason for cancer-associated mortality, and it 
exhibits the highest mortality and incidence in developed and developing 
countries. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and SCLC are the 2 main types of 
lung cancer, with NSCLC contributing to 85% of all lung carcinoma cases. 
Conventional treatment mainly involves surgery, chemoradiotherapy, and 
immunotherapy, but has a dismal prognosis for many patients. Therefore, 
identifying an effective adjuvant therapy is urgent. Historically, traditional 
herbal medicine has been an essential part of complementary and alternative 
medicine, due to its numerous targets, few side effects and substantial 
therapeutic benefits. In China and other East Asian countries, traditional 
herbal medicine is increasingly popular, and is highly accepted by patients as a 
clinical adjuvant therapy. Numerous studies have reported that herbal extracts 
and prescription medications are effective at combating tumors. It emphasizes 
that, by mainly regulating the P13K/AKT signaling pathway, the Wnt signaling 
pathway, and the NF-κB signaling pathway, herbal medicine induces apoptosis and 
inhibits the proliferation and migration of tumor cells. The present review 
discusses the anti-NSCLC mechanisms of herbal medicines and provides options for 
future adjuvant therapy in patients with NSCLC."
791,"BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy-induced gastrointestinal toxicity may lead to a 
significant impairment of the oncological patient's quality of life, as well as 
to reduced adherence to the treatment, which may have a negative impact on 
survival and mortality rates.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to investigate whether oral probiotic 
administration prevents chemotherapy (± radiotherapy)-induced gastrointestinal 
toxicity, particularly diarrhea.
METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases for 
randomized controlled trials in English published between 1990 and 2020. We 
conducted statistical data analyses expressing the treatment effect size as a 
risk ratio (RR) together with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Implications are 
based on trials rated as having a low risk of bias (RoB).
RESULTS: We included 8 trials (n = 697 participants), from which 3 studies rated 
as low RoB contained primary endpoint data; the risk of developing grade 3/4 
diarrhea in patients receiving probiotics was reduced by 78% compared to the 
control group (RR = 0.22 [95% CI 0.05-1.08]; P = .06; n = 114 participants). 
Probiotics showed preventive effects in patients treated with chemotherapy alone 
(RR = 0.34 [0.12-0.94]; P = .04, n = 121 participants) and in patients with 
colorectal cancer (RR = 0.56 [0.34-0.92]; P = .02; n = 208 participants). The 
reduction in the incidence of overall diarrhea was not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics failed to prove a preventive effect of statistical 
significance against the development of severe and overall diarrhea in cancer 
patients treated with chemotherapy (± radiotherapy). However, we cannot rule out 
that the effects of probiotics are clinically relevant, especially in certain 
subgroups of patients. This needs to be clarified in further well-performed 
studies."
792,"Given the evolving clinical demographics and both surgical and perioperative 
management strategies related to laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LAP-CHOL), 
continued monitoring of patient characteristics undergoing this procedure is of 
value. In an analysis of 2 345 246 patients who underwent LAP-CHOL identified in 
the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery 
Sample from 1/2016-12/2019 (female n = 1 722 420 [73.4%] and male n = 622 827 
[26.6%]), female patients were more likely to be younger and obese but less 
likely to be smoker and have medical comorbidity compared to male patients. 
Moreover, female patients were more likely to have a diagnosis of cholelithiasis 
but less likely to have a diagnosis of cholecystitis compared to male patients. 
This was particularly robust in younger age. In conclusion, this contemporary 
national-level analysis suggested that there are distinct differences in the 
clinical characteristics of patients undergoing LAP-CHOL according to gender. 
Awareness and reconciliation of these gender-specific differences would be 
important in clinical practice."
793,"BACKGROUND: Telomere dysfunction has been reported to be directly involved in 
carcinogenesis owing to chromosomal instability and immortalization; however, 
the clinicopathological significance of telomeres remains controversial. We have 
shown that telomere shortening occurs in normal-appeared duct cells at the 
initiation and then progresses during the progression of pancreatic cancer. In 
this study, we determined the clinicopathological and prognostic value of 
telomere length (TL) in cancer progression.
METHODS: TL in both cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was 
analyzed by high throughput quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH) using a previously reported cohort comprising 1,434 cases of 
adenocarcinoma (ADC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenosquamous carcinoma 
(ASC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which are 
known cancers with a significantly low incidence of alternative lengthening of 
telomeres. Cases were divided into two groups as follows: longer and shorter 
telomeres, according to the median TL of cancer cells and CAFs. The statistical 
significance of TL in cancer cells and CAFs on clinicopathological 
characteristics and prognosis were analyzed.
RESULTS: There was a close association between TL in cancer cells and CAFs. 
Longer telomeres in cancer cells and CAFs were associated with aggressive 
features such as advanced stage, high mitosis score and nuclear score, poorly 
differentiated cancer, and desmoplastic stroma in ADC. Furthermore, a longer TL 
was an independent prognostic factor for ADC, SCC and RCC.
CONCLUSION: Longer telomeres are associated with worse prognosis in ADC, SCC and 
RCC. Thus, TL is a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of aggressive cancers with 
poor prognoses."
794,"BACKGROUND: This multi-center study was aimed at retrospectively evaluating the 
feasibility, safety, clinical outcomes, and surgical learning curve of an 
optimized procedure for right upper lobectomy (RUL), which is challenging 
because of the anatomical structures and features of this lobe.
METHODS: This study included 45 RUL cases of robot-assisted thoracoscopy (RATS) 
in a pilot cohort and 187 RUL cases of video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) in 
three cohorts. A total of 121 and 111 patients underwent traditional and 
optimized RUL, respectively. The optimized surgical procedure was performed to 
consecutively transect the superior arterial trunk and bronchus, and finally 
disconnect the pulmonary vein and posterior ascending artery with interlobar 
fissures. Clinical and radiological data were reviewed retrospectively.
RESULTS: Optimized RUL can be performed successfully by RATS or VATS. The 
optimized procedure yielded better clinical outcomes than the traditional 
procedure, including shorter operation times, less blood loss, fewer 
complications, shorter hospital times, lower costs, and a lower likelihood of 
postoperative intermedius bronchial kinking. Additionally, for calcified 
interlobar lymph nodes, the optimized VATS group was less likely to be converted 
to thoracotomy than the traditional group. The skills required to perform 
optimized VATS RUL can be gained by surgeons after 12 to 15 cases. The two RUL 
procedures in the pilot cohort showed similar disease-free survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The optimized RUL was safe, economical, and feasible, with a short 
learning curve and satisfactory disease-free survival."
795,"Five-FU is a potent chemotherapeutic agent for suppressing endothelial cell 
growth. The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of local 
peritumor injection of 5-FU for patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) for 
the prevention of anemia. Between January 2020 and January 2022, patients aged 
18 years or older with AGC and moderate anemia were included. A total of 200 mg 
of 5-FU was injected per session at ten points of the lesion (20 mg at each 
point) every 7 days for 4 to 12 weeks. Patients received a blood test for 
toxicity at every cycle. From one of these patients, endoscopic biopsy specimens 
were taken from gastric cancer before and after injecting 5-FU for 
immunostaining. A total of five AGC patients participated in this study. For 
most patients, hemoglobin levels were maintained without transfusions during 
5-FU injection, and expression levels of thrombospondin-1 was increased after 
injection compared to those before injection. Blood test results during 5-FU 
injection showed no significant change in serum glutamic oxalacetic 
transaminase/glutamic pyruvic transaminase, total bilirubin, or creatinine 
level. The results of this study showed the possibility of local peritumor 5-FU 
injection as a treatment for relieving anemia of patients with gastric cancer."
796,"BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) ranks second in mortality among all malignant 
diseases worldwide. However, the cause and molecular mechanism underlying 
gastric cancer are not clear. Here, we used integrated bioinformatics to 
identify possible key genes and reveal the pathogenesis and prognosis of gastric 
cancer.
METHODS: The gene expression profiles of GSE118916, GSE79973, and GSE29272 were 
available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) between GC and normal gastric tissues were screened by R 
software and Venn diagram software. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment of DEGs was 
performed using the DAVID database. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
was established by STRING and visualized using Cytoscape software. Then the 
influence of hub genes on expression and survival was assessed using TCGA 
database.
RESULTS: A total of 83 DEGs were found in the three datasets, including 41 
up-regulated genes and 42 down-regulated genes. These DEGs were mainly enriched 
in extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion. The enriched pathways 
obtained in the KEGG pathway analysis were extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor 
interaction and focal adhesion. A PPI network of DEGs was analyzed using the 
Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) app of Cytoscape. Four genes were considered 
hub genes, including COL5A1, FBN1, SPARC, and LUM. Among them, LUM was found to 
have a significantly worse prognosis based on TCGA database.
CONCLUSIONS: We screened DEGs associated with GC by integrated bioinformatics 
analysis and found one potential biomarker that may be involved in the progress 
of GC. This hub gene may serve as a guide for further molecular biological 
experiments."
797,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of malignant tumor-related deaths worldwide. 
The presence of tumor-initiating cells in lung cancer leads to tumor recurrence, 
metastasis, and resistance to conventional treatment. Cleavage and 
polyadenylation specificity factor 4 (CPSF4) activation in tumor cells 
contributes to the poor prognosis of lung cancer. However, the precise 
biological functions and molecular mechanisms of CPSF4 in the regulation of 
tumor-initiating cells remain unclear. We demonstrated that CPSF4 promotes 
tumor-initiating phenotype and confers chemoresistance to paclitaxel both in 
vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we showed that CPSF4 binds to the promoters 
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and neuropilin-2 (NRP2) and 
activated their transcription. In addition, we showed that 
CPSF4/VEGF/NRP2-mediated tumor-initiating phenotype and chemoresistance through 
TAZ induction. Furthermore, analysis of clinical data revealed that lung cancer 
patients with high CPSF4 expression exhibit high expression levels of VEGF, 
NRP2, and TAZ and that expression of these proteins are positively correlated 
with poor prognosis. Importantly, selective inhibition of VEGF, NRP2, or TAZ 
markedly suppressed CPSF4-mediated tumor-initiating phenotype and 
chemoresistance. Our findings reveal the mechanism of CPSF4 modulating 
tumor-initiating phenotype and chemoresistance in lung cancer and indicate that 
the CPSF4-VEGF-NRP2-TAZ signaling pathway may be a prognosis marker and 
therapeutic target in lung cancer."
798,"BACKGROUND: WHO grade II and III meningiomas are more invasive than grade I 
malignancies and determine patients' shorter overall survival. Their tendency to 
recur after treatment has represented an important therapeutic challenge because 
of the limited treatment strategies at recurrence. Angiogenesis and mechanistic 
target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation are two of the main features of higher 
grade meningiomas, determining invasiveness and tendency to relapse. While these 
options prove promising, available clinical data on mTOR inhibitors' efficacy 
are somewhat limited.
CASE STUDY: We report a case of a 25-year-old female patient diagnosed with a 
right parasagittal occipital anaplastic meningioma (grade III WHO) in 2013. The 
patient underwent multiple treatments and, in 2019, a further recurrence 
occurred. The patient reported an mTOR mutation, and it is for this reason that 
the MTB approved treatment with everolimus and bevacizumab. Therapy was 
administered in May 2019, and partial response and prolonged disease control was 
obtained in November 2021, when progression took place. The patient's death 
occurred in March 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: This case report provides evidence on the efficacy of mTOR 
inhibitors as a treatment option in recurrent meningiomas. Furthermore, it 
highlights the importance of performing a molecular analysis as a preliminary 
step towards targeting the mTOR pathway."
799,"PURPOSE: Photo methods such as photo-elicitation and photovoice have 
traditionally been implemented as knowledge-generation techniques; however, they 
have also been conceptualized as tools for community impact and as interventions 
in and of themselves. We performed a scoping review to document how photo 
methods have been used in studies of cancer, to describe participant 
populations, and to identify opportunities for future directions for the use of 
photo methods in cancer.
METHODS: An a priori search strategy was implemented across health-related 
databases with the following inclusion criteria: (1) study participants were 
diagnosed with cancer and/or were caregivers of those with cancer; (2) study 
participants were asked to take and/or respond to photographs as part of the 
study protocol; (3) articles were published in peer-reviewed journals; (4) 
articles were written in English.
RESULTS: Eighty non-duplicative articles were identified; of these, 30 articles 
describing 24 individual studies were included for review. All but one (95.8%) 
of the studies utilized photovoice solely as a knowledge-generation technique 
without participant outcome measurement or analysis. Across all included 
studies, participants were largely women with breast cancer; other demographic 
and cancer-related variables (e.g., race and cancer stage) were not consistently 
reported. Caregivers were included in 37.5% of studies.
CONCLUSION: Photo methods are most frequently used in order to capture 
qualitative data in cancer populations; however, there are missed opportunities 
in their lack of use for intervention and systemic change. In addition, 
inconsistent reporting of demographics and cancer characteristics limits our 
ability to synthesize these data across studies."
800,"PURPOSE: Tumor cells thrive by adapting to the signals in their 
microenvironment. To adapt, cancer cells activate signaling and transcriptional 
programs and migrate to establish micro-niches, in response to signals from 
neighboring cells and non-cellular stromal factors. Understanding how the tumor 
microenvironment evolves during disease progression is crucial to deciphering 
the mechanisms underlying the functional behavior of cancer cells.
METHODS: Multiplex immunohistochemistry, spatial analysis and histological dyes 
were used to identify and measure immune cell infiltration, cell signal 
activation and extracellular matrix deposition in low-grade, high-grade 
astrocytoma and glioblastoma.
RESULTS: We show that lower grade astrocytoma tissue is largely devoid of 
infiltrating immune cells and extracellular matrix proteins, while high-grade 
astrocytoma exhibits abundant immune cell infiltration, activation, and 
extensive tissue remodeling. Spatial analysis shows that most T-cells are 
restricted to perivascular regions, but bone marrow-derived macrophages 
penetrate deep into neoplastic cell-rich regions. The tumor microenvironment is 
characterized by heterogeneous PI3K, MAPK and CREB signaling, with specific 
signaling profiles correlating with distinct pathological hallmarks, including 
angiogenesis, tumor cell density and regions where neoplastic cells border the 
extracellular matrix. Our results also show that tissue remodeling is important 
in regulating the architecture of the tumor microenvironment during tumor 
progression.
CONCLUSION: The tumor microenvironment in malignant astrocytoma, exhibits 
changes in cell composition, cell signaling activation and extracellular matrix 
deposition during disease development and that targeting the extracellular 
matrix, as well as cell signaling activation will be critical to designing 
personalized therapy."
801,"Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world, and 
chemotherapy can have unfavorable side effects. The aim of the present study is 
to evaluate the therapeutic anticancer role of Moringa oleifera leaf extracts 
(MLE) in urethane-induced lung cancer in adult male albino rats as compared to 
standard chemotherapy. Rats were categorized into four groups (10 rats/group), 
including negative control rats, urethane lung cancer model rats, MLE-treated 
lung cancer rats, and cisplatin-treated rats. Estimation of lung index, some 
biochemical markers of oxidative stress, quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT-PCR), and histopathology and transmission electron microscopy were 
performed. The lung index was significantly increased about one-fold in urethane 
lung cancer model rats, but it decreased after MLE treatment. Also, MLE was able 
to improve the induced changes in glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and 
malondialdehyde concentration to be 3.8 ± 0.4 mg/g, 900.6 ± 58 U/g, and 
172 ± 24 nmol/g, respectively. Additionally, after MLE treatment, the expression 
of EGFR-mRNA increased by about 50%. Our light and electron microscopic 
examination revealed that urethane group showed abnormally distributed excessive 
collagen fibers and the development of papillary adenocarcinoma from 
hyperplastic Clara cells in the lumen of terminal bronchiole with bronchiolar 
wall thickening, alveolar collapse, and inflammation. MLE group has moderate 
amount of collagen fiber and absence of tumor mass and provided more or less 
restoration of normal lung histology. Moreover, MLE was able to ameliorate the 
induced changes in mucin and PCNA positive cells in the lung by 10.8 ± 2.3%. 
Collectively, the current study showed that MLE could be used as anticancer 
agents alleviating changes associated with lung cancer in a urethane-induced 
lung cancer bearing rats thereby representing alternative options to toxic 
chemotherapy."
802,"OBJECTIVES: In many countries, workers who developed asbestosis due to their 
occupation are eligible for government support. Based on the results of clinical 
examination, a team of pulmonologists determine the eligibility of patients to 
these programs. In this Dutch cohort study, we aim to demonstrate the potential 
role of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system for automated, 
standardized, and cost-effective evaluation of applications for asbestosis 
patients.
METHODS: A dataset of n = 523 suspected asbestosis cases/applications from 
across the Netherlands was retrospectively collected. Each case/application was 
reviewed, and based on the criteria, a panel of three pulmonologists would 
determine eligibility for government support. An AI system is proposed, which 
uses thoracic CT images as input, and predicts the assessment of the clinical 
panel. Alongside imaging, we evaluated the added value of lung function 
parameters.
RESULTS: The proposed AI algorithm reached an AUC of 0.87 (p < 0.001) in the 
prediction of accepted versus rejected applications. Diffusion capacity (DLCO) 
also showed comparable predictive value (AUC = 0.85, p < 0.001), with little 
correlation between the two parameters (r-squared = 0.22, p < 0.001). The 
combination of the imaging AI score and DLCO achieved superior performance (AUC 
= 0.95, p < 0.001). Interobserver variability between pulmonologists on the 
panel was estimated at alpha = 0.65 (Krippendorff's alpha).
CONCLUSION: We developed an AI system to support the clinical decision-making 
process for the application to the government support for asbestosis. A 
multicenter prospective validation study is currently ongoing to examine the 
added value and reliability of this system alongside the clinic panel.
KEY POINTS: • Artificial intelligence can detect imaging patterns of asbestosis 
in CT scans in a cohort of patients applying for state aid. • Combining the AI 
prediction with the diffusing lung function parameter reaches the highest 
diagnostic performance. • Specific cases with fibrosis but no asbestosis were 
correctly classified, suggesting robustness of the AI system, which is currently 
under prospective validation."
803,"PURPOSE: Aim of the present study is to describe our robot-assisted simple 
prostatectomy technique and to report 6-month surgical and clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Eighty men were consecutively submitted to robot-assisted simple 
prostatectomy in our institution from October 2019 to October 2020. All 
procedures were performed by the same surgical team. Diagnostic preoperative 
assessment was based on history, symptoms evaluation by International Prostate 
Symptom Score, digital rectal examination, flowmetry with post-void residual 
volume measurement by abdominal ultrasound, prostatic volume estimation by MRI, 
PSA dosage. Under combined general and subarachnoid anesthesia, surgery was 
performed via a transperitoneal approach using a Da Vinci Si system in the 
four-arm configuration. Operative time, blood loss, hospital stay, 
catheterization time, intraoperative and postoperative complications were 
assessed. Clinical postoperative 6 months of evaluation was based on physical 
examination, flowmetry with post-void residual volume measurement, PSA dosage, 
and International Prostate Symptom Score.
RESULTS: Mean operative time was 105.29 min, mean hospital staying 5.4 days. 
Blood loss was low in all cases and only 2 patients received transfusion. 
Catheterization time was 7 days. According to the Clavien-Dindo classification, 
only minor (grade I and grade II) intraoperative and postoperative complications 
were observed. At 6-month postoperative assessment, a statistically significant 
increase of urinary flow indexes and bladder capacity was recorded, as a 
significant reduction of urinary residual volume. No patient experienced stress 
urinary incontinence and the mean postoperative IPSS score was significantly 
reduced to 4.3. Two patients were diagnosed with incidental prostatic cancer at 
the histopathological examination.
CONCLUSIONS: Data collected in our experience on a large cohort confirm efficacy 
and safety of Robot-Assisted Simple Prostatectomy. This procedure allows both 
short operative time and hospital staying, with low incidence of perioperative 
complications. This surgical technique can therefore be considered a valid 
alternative to other procedures for the surgical treatment of large volume 
prostates. Randomized prospective and comparative studies are warranted in the 
future to assess if different RASP techniques provide similar surgical and 
functional outcomes."
804,"The key cell population permits cancer cells to avoid immune-surveillance is 
regulatory T cells (Tregs). This study evaluates the level of Tregs in chronic 
myeloid leukemia (CML) patients and the effect of Tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI) on Treg levels, as a pathway to understand the immune response and 
behavior among advance stage and optimal response CML patients using imatinib 
therapy. Blood samples were collected from 30 CML patients (optimal response to 
TKI), 30 CML patients (failure response to TKI), and 30 age- and gender-matched 
controls. Analysis involved measuring percentages of Tregs 
(CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 +) by flow cytometer and demethylation levels of FOXP3 
Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) by PCR. The data revealed that Tregs 
and the FOXP3-TSDR demethylation percentages significantly increased in failure 
response group in comparison to the optimal response and control groups, while 
no significant difference between optimal response and control groups. Tregs and 
FOXP3 TSDR demethylation percentages showed high sensitivity and specificity, 
suggesting powerful discriminatory biomarkers between failure and optimal 
groups. An assessment of the Tregs and demethylation percentage among different 
BCR-ABL levels of CML patients on TKI revealed no significant differences in 
parameter percentage in the optimal response to TKI patients with different 
molecular responses (log 3 reduction or other deeper log 4.5 and 5 reduction 
levels). Our findings demonstrate an effective role of functional Tregs among 
different CML stages. Also, the study suggests that the major molecular response 
to therapy at level 0.1% of BCR-ABL transcript could be enough to induce immune 
system restoration in patients."
805,"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J1 (UBE2J1) has been proven to participate in 
the ubiquitination of multiple substrate proteins. However, the underlying 
mechanisms of UBE2J1 as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme participating in cancer 
development and progression remain largely unknown. Here, we identified that 
UBE2J1 is downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and cell lines which 
are mediated by DNA hypermethylation of its promoter, and decreased UBE2J1 is 
associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, UBE2J1 serving as a suppressor 
gene inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells. Mechanistically, 
UBE2J1-TRIM25, forming an E2-E3 complex, physically interacts with and targets 
RPS3 for ubiquitination and degradation at the K214 residue. The downregulated 
RPS3 caused by UBE2J1 overexpression restrains NF-κB translocation into the 
nucleus and therefore inactivates the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our study 
revealed a novel role of UBE2J1-mediated RPS3 poly-ubiquitination and 
degradation in disrupting the NF-κB signaling pathway, which may serve as a 
novel and promising biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC."
806,"Nano-immunotherapy has been recognized as a highly promising strategy for cancer 
treatment in recent decades, which combines nanotechnology and immunotherapy to 
combat against tumors. Hybrid nanomaterials consisting of at least two 
constituents with distinct compositions and properties, usually organic and 
inorganic, have been engineered with integrated functions and enormous potential 
in boosting cancer immunotherapy. This review provides a summary of hybrid 
nanomaterials reported for cancer immunotherapy, including nanoscale 
metal-organic frameworks, metal-phenolic networks, mesoporous organosilica 
nanoparticles, metallofullerene nanomaterials, polymer-lipid, and 
biomacromolecule-based hybrid nanomaterials. The combination of immunotherapy 
with chemotherapy, chemodynamic therapy, radiotherapy, radiodynamic therapy, 
photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and sonodynamic therapy based on 
hybrid nanomaterials is also discussed. Finally, the current challenges and the 
prospects for designing hybrid nanomaterials and their application in cancer 
immunotherapy are outlined."
807,"Different types of stem cells have remarkable characteristics such as high 
proliferation rate, multi/pluripotency, self-renewal, and broad differentiation 
that can effectively treat diseases, cancers, and damages. Despite abundant 
therapeutic applications of stem cells in medical science, numerous risks 
threaten stem cell transplantation. Tumor development, immune response, cellular 
senescence, dosage effects, and administration timing are critical risks that 
should be considered in stem cell therapy. Hence, an investigation of possible 
risks is required before utilizing stem cell-based medicinal products in the 
clinical phase and human trials. This review aims to survey the literature and 
perspectives on the advantages and risks associated with pluripotent and 
multipotent stem cells."
808,"The outcome of laser-triggered plasmons-induced phototherapy, including 
photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), is significantly 
limited by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and the upregulation of heat shock 
proteins (HSPs) in response to heat stress. Mitochondria, the biological battery 
of cells, can serve as an important breakthrough to overcome these obstacles. 
Herein, dendritic triangular pyramidal plasmonic CuPt alloys loaded with 
heat-sensitive NO donor N, N'-di-sec-butyl-N, N'-dinitroso-1,4-phenylenediamine 
(BNN) is developed. Under 808 nm laser irradiation, plasmonic CuPt can generate 
superoxide anion free radicals (·O2 - ) and heat simultaneously. The heat 
generated can then trigger the release of NO gas, which not only enables gas 
therapy but also damages the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Impaired 
mitochondrial respiration leads to reduced oxygen consumption and insufficient 
intracellular ATP supply, which effectively alleviates tumor hypoxia and 
undermines the synthesis of HSPs, in turn boosting plasmonic CuPt-based PDT and 
mild PTT. Additionally, the generated NO and ·O2 - can react to form more 
cytotoxic peroxynitrite (ONOO- ). This work describes a plasmonic CuPt@BNN (CPB) 
triggered closed-loop NO gas, free radicals, and mild photothermal therapy 
strategy that is highly effective at reciprocally promoting antitumor outcomes."
809,"AIM: To investigate the effect of discharge training on surgical recovery in 
oncology patients.
DESIGN: A two-arm parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) registered at 
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04862104) and reporting according to the CONSORT 
checklist.
METHODS: The study was conducted with 78 patients who had undergone cancer 
surgery in a university hospital. The intervention group took discharge 
training; the control group received routine care. The surgical recovery was 
measured before discharge and 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the discharge.
RESULTS: There was a higher surgical recovery score in the intervention group 
compared with the usual care group at the second, fourth and eighth week after 
discharge. This study is expected to support discharge training as enhancing 
recovery in oncology surgical patients.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that discharge training developed based on 
the Nursing Intervention Classification can be used in clinics to enhance the 
surgical recovery of patients."
810,"Underlying medical conditions, such as cancer, kidney disease and heart failure, 
are associated with a higher risk for severe COVID-19. Accurate classification 
of COVID-19 patients with underlying medical conditions is critical for 
personalized treatment decision and prognosis estimation. In this study, we 
propose an interpretable artificial intelligence model termed VDJMiner to mine 
the underlying medical conditions and predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients 
according to their immune repertoires. In a cohort of more than 1400 COVID-19 
patients, VDJMiner accurately identifies multiple underlying medical conditions, 
including cancers, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease, diabetes, 
congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, asthma and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, with an average area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.961. Meanwhile, in this same cohort, VDJMiner 
achieves an AUC of 0.922 in predicting severe COVID-19. Moreover, VDJMiner 
achieves an accuracy of 0.857 in predicting the response of COVID-19 patients to 
tocilizumab treatment on the leave-one-out test. Additionally, VDJMiner 
interpretively mines and scores V(D)J gene segments of the T-cell receptors that 
are associated with the disease. The identified associations between single-cell 
V(D)J gene segments and COVID-19 are highly consistent with previous studies.

811,"BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy (RC) with lymph node dissection is the mainstay 
of treatment for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and high 
risk non-MIBC. The American Joint Committee on Cancer's (AJCC) node staging and 
lymph node ratio (LNR) systems are used in estimating prognosis; however, they 
do not directly factor in negative dissected nodes. In this study, we evaluated 
the log odds of positive lymph nodes (LODDS), a novel measure of nodal 
involvement, as a predictor of survival.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients who underwent RC were 
retrospectively included and their demographic and clinical data were collected. 
Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression were used for survival analyses.
RESULTS: Median number of dissected lymph nodes was 13 (range 3-45). ROC curve 
analysis indicated -0.92 as the optimal LODDS cutoff. LODDS > -0.92 was 
associated with higher T stage, lymphovascular invasion, and significantly worse 
overall survival (OS) (mean OS 18.6 vs. 45.1 months, P-value < .001). 
Furthermore, we evaluated AJCC node staging, LNR, and LODDS in three separate 
multivariable Cox regression models. Among 3 different measures of nodal disease 
burden, only LODDS was an independent predictor of OS (HR 2.71, 95% CI 
1.28-5.73, P = .009).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that LODDS is an independent predictor of OS and 
outperforms AJCC node staging and LNR in forecasting prognosis among patients 
with urothelial bladder cancer who undergo RC."
812,"BACKGROUND: Adults with triple-class refractory (TCR) multiple myeloma (MM) have 
limited treatment options and poor prognosis, but the burden of TCR MM has not 
been well characterized. This study evaluated treatment patterns, overall 
survival (OS), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and healthcare resource 
use (HCRU) among patients with TCR MM in US clinical practice.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with TCR MM in the Connect MM Registry 
(NCT01081028; a large, US, multicenter, prospective observational cohort study 
of patients with newly diagnosed MM) were included. Patient characteristics, 
treatment patterns, HRQoL, and HCRU were analyzed using descriptive statistics. 
OS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology for the overall cohort and for 
patients with/without ≥1 post-TCR line of therapy (LOT).
RESULTS: A total of 232 patients with TCR MM were included; 155 (67%) had ≥1 
post-TCR LOT (post-TCR-Treated subgroup; median 9.9 months of follow-up). Most 
common post-TCR treatments were carfilzomib (47%), pomalidomide (40%), and 
daratumumab (26%); median treatment duration was 3.3 months. Median OS was 9.9 
months in the overall population, 10.8 months in post-TCR-Treated patients, and 
2.6 months for those with no new post-TCR LOT. HRQoL deteriorated and pain 
increased over 1 year of follow-up, with clinically meaningfully changes in 
EQ-5D (mean, -0.06 points) and FACT-G (mean, -9.9 points). 124 (53%) patients 
had ≥1 all-cause hospitalization and 58 (25%) had ≥1 MM-related hospitalization; 
median annualized length of stay was 35.3 and 42.9 days, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The burden of TCR MM is substantial, emphasizing the need for more 
effective treatment options in the TCR setting."
813,"There is growing awareness of the importance of sexual health in the quality of 
life of cancer patients and survivors. Brachytherapy, a vital component for the 
curative treatment of cervical cancer, leads to both direct and indirect 
sequelae that result in vaginal and sexual morbidity. The emergence of 3D 
image-guided adaptive brachytherapy has led to a better understanding of 
dose-and-effect relationships for critical organs-at-risk and there are new 
recommendations for vaginal dose reporting in the ongoing EMBRACE II study. An 
understanding of the vagina as an organ-at-risk and its dose-and-effect 
relationships can help brachytherapists limit dose to the vagina and improve 
sexual morbidity. Brachytherapists play a critical role in the primary and 
secondary prevention of vaginal and sexual sequelae resulting from treatment. 
Through close surveillance and recognition of common symptoms, brachytherapists 
can intervene with effective strategies to prevent and treat vaginal and sexual 
symptoms. This review summarizes the current literature on dosimetric factors 
that may predict for vaginal morbidity. It will focus on quantitative and 
qualitative reports of brachytherapy-related vaginal toxicity and sexual 
dysfunction. Lastly, it will review the available evidence supporting clinical 
interventions to mitigate the development and progression of vaginal and sexual 
sequelae to improve functional quality post-treatment."
814,"Extraskeletal osteosarcoma (EOS) is a high grade soft tissue tumour 
characterised by the production of malignant osteoid, without 
attachment/involvement of underlying bone/periosteum. Rarely, EOS presents as a 
cutaneous tumour. The clinical behaviour of primary cutaneous EOS (PC-EOS) 
remains incompletely characterised. Herein we present the largest case series of 
PC-EOS reported to date. Sixteen PC-EOS cases from the archives/consultation 
files were retrieved (male:female 1:1; age 31-96 years, mean age 66 years). The 
tumours measured 1-10 cm (mean 3.2 cm) and were located on the lower extremity 
(7), head (6), upper extremity (2), and trunk (1). They consisted of 
pleomorphic, spindled-to-epithelioid cells, with fascicular, nodular, or 
sheet-like growth patterns and foci of malignant osteoid. Immunohistochemistry 
did not reveal specific lines of differentiation, and there was no evidence of 
other tumour types. A literature review was conducted to identify all well 
characterised cases of PC-EOS. A combined analysis of present and past cases was 
performed to determine overall trends in clinical characteristics and outcomes. 
The mean follow-up period was 23.9 months, during which 67.5% of patients 
experienced progression-free survival and 18% of patients died of disease. Rates 
of local recurrence and metastasis were 10% and 25%, respectively, approximately 
double past estimates. These data suggest that the prognosis of PC-EOS is less 
favourable than previously thought. The differential diagnosis includes benign 
entities (e.g., ossifying pyogenic granuloma) and malignant neoplasms with 
heterologous osteosarcomatous differentiation (e.g., carcinosarcoma, 
transdifferentiated melanoma). Wide excision remains the standard of care, and 
the role of chemotherapy and radiation remains inconclusive. Recognition of this 
rare entity can facilitate prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment."
815,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The novel International Association for the Study of 
Lung Cancer (IASLC) grading system of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) 
demonstrated a remarkable prognostic effect and enabled numerous patients to 
benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. We sought to build a CT-based nomogram for 
preoperative prediction of the IASLC grading.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This work retrospectively analyzed the CT images and 
clinical data of 303 patients with pathologically confirmed invasive ADC. The 
histological subtypes and radiological characteristics of the patients were 
re-evaluated. Radiomics features were extracted, and the optimal subset of 
features was established by ANOVA, spearman correlation analysis, and the least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Univariate and multivariate 
analyses identified the independent clinical and radiological variables. 
Finally, multivariate logistic regression analysis incorporated clinical, 
radiological, and optimal radiomics features into the nomogram. Receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and accuracy were applied to assess the 
model's performance. Decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curve were 
applied to assess the clinical usefulness.
RESULTS: Nine selected CT image features were used to develop the radiomics 
model. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of the radiomics 
model outperformed the clinic-radiological model in the training and testing 
sets. Integrating Radscore with independent radiological characteristics showed 
higher prediction performance than clinic-radiological characteristics alone in 
the training (AUC, 0.915 vs. 0.882; DeLong, p < 0.05) and testing (AUC, 0.838 
vs. 0.782; DeLong, p < 0.05) sets. Good calibration and decision curve analysis 
demonstrated the clinical usefulness of the nomogram.
CONCLUSION: Radiomics features effectively predict high-grade ADC. The combined 
nomogram may facilitate selecting patients who benefit from adjuvant treatment."
816,"BACKGROUND: Running online training in mammography interpretation poses a 
challenge to radiologists and reporting radiographers due to the large size of 
digital mammograms in DICOM format and limited bandwidth capabilities of the 
users for image transmission. This study aims to compare image quality between 
the full-quality with minimal compressed JPEG and DICOM format of mammograms on 
a diagnostic monitor through the evaluation of radiologists and radiographers.
METHODS: Twelve participants including six radiologists and six radiographers 
participated as observers in this study. The observers viewed 60 2D digital 
mammography screening cases (22 cancer and 38 normal cases) in DICOM and minimal 
compressed JPEG formats on a 5MP diagnostic monitor. A 5-point Likert scale was 
provided for observers to compare the quality of mammograms between the two 
formats, with text anchors indicating to one image being significantly better, 
slightly better or of equal quality in terms of technical and diagnostic 
aspects. Nonparametric descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the ratings 
of radiologists and radiographers in different characteristics of mammograms of 
two image formats.
RESULTS: The DICOM and JPEG images were statistically equivalent through ratings 
from radiographers in brightness, contrast, dynamic range, sharpness, no 
significant distortion, no significant noise, and background homogeneity in all 
mammograms. Similarly, most radiologists rated DICOM and JPEG images clinically 
and statistically equivalent with respect to difficulty of interpretation, 
brightness, contrast, dynamic range, sharpness, the appearance of Cooper's 
ligaments, visibility of subtle microcalcifications, visibility of structures at 
the margins of the breast. Normal cases were marginally favored by radiologists 
in DICOM format (ranging from 0.4% to 5.3%) while cancer cases in JPEG (ranging 
from 0.8% to 7.6%) received slightly higher rating.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings showed that baseline full-quality with minimal compression 
JPEG was equivalent to the DICOM format of full-field digital mammograms which 
suggests that this type of JPEG could be used for online training and education 
in radiology."
817,"OBJECTIVE: Female cancer survivors planning to become pregnant are concerned 
about the impact of cancer treatment on their ability to maintain normal 
pregnancy and the negative impact on their offspring. However, studies on the 
pregnancy outcomes of cancer survivors in Japan are limited. Therefore, this 
study aimed to investigate the pregnancy outcomes of female cancer survivors by 
comparing them with women without a history of malignant tumors in Japan.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 3308 subjects, based on an 
internet-based questionnaire (self-reported) survey conducted in Japan. 
Differences in pregnancy outcomes, including multiple pregnancies, stillbirth, 
preterm birth (PTB), and infant birthweight, between cancer survivors and 
subjects without a history of malignant tumors, were evaluated using a 
generalized linear mixed-effects model with adjustment for possible confounding 
factors.
RESULTS: Of 3308 subjects included in this study, 629 (19.0%) were cancer 
survivors, among whom cervical (40.4%), breast (19.1%), and thyroid (7.0%) 
malignancies were most frequent. 71 (2.2%) and 53 (1.6%) participants had a 
history of multiple pregnancies and stillbirth, respectively; 385 (11.8%), 179 
(5.5%), and 137 (4.2%) participants, respectively, had histories of PTB at less 
than 37, 34, and 32 weeks of gestation. Further, 302 (10.7%), 326 (11.6%), and 
330 (11.7%) participants delivered to low birthweight (LBW), 
small-for-gestational-age (SGA), and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants, 
respectively. Subjects with a history of cervical or breast cancers had 
significantly higher odds of PTB at <37 weeks of gestation (adjusted odds ratios 
[ORs], 1.87 [95% CI: 1.25-2.81] and 2.61 [95% CI: 1.77-3.86], respectively), 
preterm LBW infants (adjusted ORs, 2.70 [95% CI: 1.39-5.24] and 2.76 [95% CI: 
1.03-7.38], respectively), and LGA infants (1.98 [95% CI: 1.36-2.89] and 1.99 
[95% CI: 1.14-3.49], respectively), compared to those without a history of a 
malignant tumor. Subjects with a history of thyroid cancer had significantly 
higher odds of stillbirth (adjusted OR, 5.11 [95% CI: 1.11-23.5]).
CONCLUSION: Cancer survivors had a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes 
than those without a history of malignant tumors in Japan. Healthcare providers 
should consider the high likelihood of adverse pregnancy outcomes during 
preconception counseling for cancer survivors."
818,"Long-term survival in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and lung 
metastasis remains unexplored in Japan. This study aimed to investigate the 
long-term survival and prognostic factors of radioiodine therapy (RIT) in a 
University Hospital setting. This retrospective study included 62 patients with 
lung metastases from DTC who received RIT between March 2005 and December 2016. 
According to the 131I whole-body scan and chest computed tomography results, 
lung metastases were classified as 131I-avid or non-131I-avid, and miliary, 
micronodular, or macronodular metastases. The 5- and 10-year overall survival 
(OS) rates from the initial RIT were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and 
a proportional hazard fit analysis was performed to determine prognostic 
factors. With a median follow-up of 7.9 years, the 5- and 10-year OS rates from 
the initial RIT were 93% and 72%, respectively. Univariable and multivariable 
analyses of patient subgroups revealed that macronodular lung metastases 
(defined as nodules >1 cm), older age at initial RIT, and high thyroglobulin 
values (>400 ng/mL) at initial RIT predicted low OS. The 5- and 10-year OS rates 
of DTC patients with lung metastases were similar to those in previous Japanese 
reports, which included a smaller sample size compared with ours. Patients with 
≤1 cm lung metastases, aged ≤55 years, and a thyroglobulin level of ≤400 ng/mL 
at the initial RIT had favorable outcomes."
819,"BACKGROUND: The fat mass and nutritional status play important roles in the 
onset and progression of cancer cachexia. The present study evaluated the joint 
prognostic value of the fat mass, as indicated by the triceps skinfold thickness 
(TSF), and the serum albumin level, for mortality in patients with cancer 
cachexia.
METHODS: We performed a multicentre cohort study including 5134 patients with 
cancer cachexia from January 2013 to April 2019. The sum of the TSF (mm) and 
serum albumin (g/L) was defined as the triceps skinfold-albumin index (TA). 
Harrell's C index, a time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve analysis and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the 
prognostic performance of the TA and other indices. Optimal stratification was 
used to identify the thresholds to define a low TA, and the association of the 
TA with all-cause mortality was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox 
proportional hazard regression models.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 2408 women and 2726 men with a median age of 
58.6 years and a median follow-up of 44 months. A total of 607 women (TA < 49.9) 
and 817 men (TA < 45.6) were classified as having a low TA. The TA showed better 
discrimination performance (C index = 0.621, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 0.607-0.636) to predict mortality in patients with cancer cachexia than 
the handgrip strength, the nutritional risk index, the prognostic nutritional 
index, the controlling nutritional status index, the systemic 
immune-inflammation index, the modified Glasgow prognostic score, and the TSF or 
albumin alone in the study population (all P < 0.05). The 1-, 3- and 5-year 
time-dependent ROC analyses (AUC = 0.647, 0.625 and 0.630, respectively) showed 
that the TA had the highest prognostic value among all indices investigated (all 
P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that a lower TA was associated with an 
increased death hazard (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.859, 95% CI = 1.677-2.062), 
regardless of the sex and cancer type. Multivariable survival analysis showed 
that a lower TA was independently associated with an increased death hazard 
(HR = 1.381, 95% CI = 1.223-1.560). This association was significantly 
strengthened in patients who did not receive curative chemotherapy (HR = 1.491, 
95% CI = 1.298-1.713), those who had higher serum total protein levels 
(HR = 1.469, 95% CI = 1.284-1.681) and those with better physical performance 
(HR = 1.453, 95% CI = 1.271-1.662).
CONCLUSIONS: This study defined and evaluated a new prognostic index, the TA, 
which may improve the selection of intervention strategies to optimize the 
survival of patients with cancer cachexia."
820,"Recent evidence supports the role of aggressive local treatment in the 
oligometastatic setting. In this review, we discuss the top 10 lessons we have 
learned from trials in oligometastatic cancers. Major lessons learned pertain to 
definitions of oligometastatic disease, outcomes, toxicity, costs, and the 
combination of ablative therapies with systemic therapy, including 
immunotherapy. Barriers to accrual for trials and upcoming phase III trials are 
also reviewed. These lessons may help to inform clinical practice and may be the 
basis for future research in the oligometastatic space."
821,"BACKGROUND: Patient participation in clinical trials is influenced by 
demographic and other individuallevel characteristics. However, there is less 
research on the role of geography and neighborhood-level factors on clinical 
trial participation. This study identifies the demographic, clinical, 
geographic, and neighborhood predictors of consenting to a clinical trial among 
cancer patients at a large, urban, NCI-designated cancer center in the 
Mid-Atlantic region.
METHODS: We used demographic and clinical data from patients diagnosed with 
cancer between 2015 and 2017. We geocoded patient addresses and calculated 
driving distance to the cancer center. Additionally, we linked patient data to 
neighborhood-level educational attainment, social capital and cancer prevalence. 
Finally, we used generalized linear mixed-effects conditional logistic 
regression to identify individual and neighborhood-level predictors of 
consenting to a clinical trial.
RESULTS: Patients with higher odds of consenting to trials were: Non-Hispanic 
White, aged 50-69, diagnosed with breast, GI, head/neck, hematologic, or certain 
solid tumor cancers, those with cancers at regional stage, never/former tobacco 
users, and those with the highest neighborhood social capital index. Patients 
who lived further from the cancer center had higher odds of consenting to a 
trial. With every 1-km increase in residential distance, there was a 4% increase 
in the odds that patients would consent to a trial. Neither of the additional 
neighborhood-level variables predicted consenting to a clinical trial.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies important demographic, patient-level, and 
geographic factors associated with consenting to cancer clinical trials, and 
lays the groundwork for future research exploring the role of neighborhood-level 
factors in clinical trial participation."
822,"BACKGROUND: Normal-tissue complication probability (NTCP) models predict 
complication risk in patients receiving radiotherapy, considering radiation dose 
to healthy tissues, and are used to select patients for proton therapy, based on 
their expected reduction in risk after proton therapy versus photon radiotherapy 
(ΔNTCP). Recommended model evaluation measures include area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC), overall calibration (CITL), and 
calibration slope (CS), whose precise relation to patient selection is still 
unclear. We investigated how each measure relates to patient selection outcomes.
METHODS: The model validation and consequent patient selection process was 
simulated within empirical head and neck cancer patient data. By manipulating 
performance measures independently via model perturbations, the relation between 
model performance and patient selection was studied.
RESULTS: Small reductions in AUC (-0.02) yielded mean changes in ΔNTCP between 
0.9-3.2%, and single-model patient selection differences between 2-19%. 
Deviations (-0.2 or +0.2) in CITL or CS yielded mean changes in ΔNTCP between 
0.3-1.4%, and single-model patient selection differences between 1-10%.
CONCLUSIONS: Each measure independently impacts ΔNTCP and patient selection and 
should thus be assessed in a representative sufficiently large external sample. 
Our suggested practical model selection approach is considering the model with 
the highest AUC, and recalibrating it if needed."
823,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dynamic positron emission tomography/computed tomography 
(PET/CT) served the potential role of characterizing malignant foci. The main 
objective of this prospective study was to explore the advantage of dynamic 
PET/CT imaging in characterizing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with probable head and neck disease underwent a 
local dynamic PET/CT scan followed by a whole-body static scan. Patlak analysis 
was used to generate parametric influx rate constant (Ki) images from 48 frames 
obtained from a dynamic PET/CT scan. By delineating the volumes-of-interest 
(VOIs) of: primary tumor (PT), lymph node (LN), and normal nasopharyngeal 
tissues (N), we acquired the corresponding Ki mean and SUVmean of each site 
respectively to perform the quantitative statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Qualified images of 71 patients with newly diagnosed NPC and 8 without 
nasopharyngeal malignant lesions were finally included. We found the 
correlations between Ki mean-PT and critical clinical features, including 
clinical stage (r = 0.368), T category (r = 0.643) and EBV-DNA copy status (r = 
0.351), and Ki mean-PT differed within the group. SUVmean-PT showed correlations 
with clinical stage (r = 0.280) and T category (r = 0.472), but could hardly 
differ systematically within group of clinical features except T category. Ki 
mean-LN offered the positive correlations with N category (r = 0.294), M 
category (r = 0.238) and EBV-DNA copy status (r = 0.446), and differed within 
the group. In addition, Ki mean represented a sensitivity of 94.4% and a 
specificity of 100%, in distinguishing NPC from the non-NPC, when the cut-off 
was defined as 0.0106. When the cut-off of SUV being defined as 2.03, the 
sensitivity and specificity were both 100%.
CONCLUSION: Our research confirmed Ki compared favorably to SUV in 
characterizing NPC and found that Ki can serve as an effective imaging marker of 
NPC."
824,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Daily plan adaptations could take the dose delivered in 
previous fractions into account. Due to high dose delivered per fraction, low 
number of fractions, steep dose gradients, and large interfractional organ 
deformations, this might be particularly important for liver SBRT. This study 
investigates inter-algorithm variation of interfractional dose accumulation for 
MR-guided liver SBRT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed 27 consecutive MR-guided liver SBRT 
treatments of 67.5 Gy in three (n=15) or 50 Gy in five fractions (n=12), both 
prescribed to the GTV. We calculated fraction doses on daily patient anatomy, 
warped these doses to the simulation MRI using seven different algorithms, and 
accumulated the warped doses. Thus, we obtained differences in planned doses and 
warped or accumulated doses for each algorithm. This enabled us to calculate the 
inter-algorithm variations in warped doses per fraction and in accumulated doses 
per treatment course.
RESULTS: The four intensity-based algorithms were more consistent with planned 
PTV dose than affine or contour-based algorithms. The mean (range) variation of 
the dose difference for PTV D95% due to dose warping by these intensity-based 
algorithms was 10.4 percentage points (0.3 to 43.7) between fractions and 8.6 
(0.3 to 24.9) between accumulated treatment doses. As seen by these ranges, the 
variation was very dependent on the patient and the fraction being analyzed. 
Nevertheless, no correlations between patient or plan characteristics on the one 
hand and inter-algorithm dose warping variation on the other hand was found.
CONCLUSION: Inter-algorithm dose accumulation variation is highly patient- and 
fraction-dependent for MR-guided liver SBRT. We advise against trusting a single 
algorithm for dose accumulation in liver SBRT."
825,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to determine the prognostic value of a 
pre-treatment peripheral blood signature and the peripheral blood 
signature-based nomogram for patients with non-metastatic nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma (NPC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected 21 peripheral blood 
indicators from patients with NPC between 2004 and 2015. Data were randomly 
divided into a training and a validation set (ratio: 6:4). The peripheral blood 
signature was constructed based on candidate biomarkers using the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression model. Multivariable logistic 
regression was applied to identify the independent risk factors of overall 
survival to build the nomogram. The predictive value of the peripheral blood 
nomogram was evaluated using time-dependent area under the curve, decision curve 
analysis, and calibration curve.
RESULTS: In total, 6668 patients were enrolled with 4000 and 2668 in the 
training and validation cohorts, respectively. Four peripheral blood indicators, 
(white blood cell count, lymphocyte percentage, haemoglobin, and mean platelet 
volume), were included to construct the peripheral blood signature. Patients 
were divided into low- and high-risk groups using an optimal cut-off value of 
-1.71142. Patients in the high-risk group had significantly lower overall, 
distant metastasis-free, and progression-free survival than patients in the 
low-risk group in both cohorts (P < 0.05). We constructed and validated a 
peripheral blood signature-based nomogram in combination with five vital 
clinical characteristics, (age, sex, tumour stage, nodal stage, and 
pre-treatment Epstein-Barr virus DNA), which showed favourable performance.
CONCLUSION: Patients with NPC with different outcomes could be distinguished 
based on their peripheral blood signature score; the proposed peripheral blood 
signature-based nomogram offers individualised risk estimation."
826,"OBJECTIVE: The liver-derived circulating PCSK9 enhances the degradation of the 
LDL receptor (LDLR) in endosomes/lysosomes. PCSK9 inhibition or silencing is 
presently used in clinics worldwide to reduce LDL-cholesterol, resulting in 
lower incidence of cardiovascular disease and possibly cancer/metastasis. The 
mechanism by which the PCSK9-LDLR complex is sorted to degradation compartments 
is not fully understood. We previously suggested that out of the three M1, M2 
and M3 subdomains of the C-terminal Cys/His-rich-domain (CHRD) of PCSK9, only M2 
is critical for the activity of extracellular of PCSK9 on cell surface LDLR. 
This likely implicates the binding of M2 to an unknown membrane-associated 
""protein X"" that would escort the complex to endosomes/lysosomes for 
degradation. We reported that a nanobody P1.40 binds the M1 and M3 domains of 
the CHRD and inhibits the function of PCSK9. It was also reported that the 
cytosolic adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1) could bind M1 and M3 
subdomains and enhance the activity of PCSK9. In this study, we determined the 
3-dimensional structure of the CHRD-P1.40 complex to understand the intricate 
interplay between P1.40, CAP1 and PCSK9 and how they regulate LDLR degradation.
METHODS: X-ray diffraction of the CHRD-P1.40 complex was analyzed with a 2.2 Å 
resolution. The affinity and interaction of PCSK9 or CHRD with P1.40 or CAP1 was 
analyzed by atomic modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, bio-layer 
interferometry, expression in hepatic cell lines and immunocytochemistry to 
monitor LDLR degradation. The CHRD-P1.40 interaction was further analyzed by 
deep mutational scanning and binding assays to validate the role of predicted 
critical residues. Conformational changes and atomic models were obtained by 
small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).
RESULTS: We demonstrate that PCSK9 exists in a closed or open conformation and 
that P1.40 favors the latter by binding key residues in the M1 and M3 subdomains 
of the CHRD. Our data show that CAP1 is well secreted by hepatic cells and binds 
extracellular PCSK9 at distinct residues in the M1 and M3 modules and in the 
acidic prodomain. CAP1 stabilizes the closed conformation of PCSK9 and prevents 
P1.40 binding. However, CAP1 siRNA only partially inhibited PCSK9 activity on 
the LDLR. By modeling the previously reported interaction between M2 and an 
R-X-E motif in HLA-C, we identified Glu567 and Arg549 as critical M2 residues 
binding HLA-C. Amazingly, these two residues are also required for the 
PCSK9-induced LDLR degradation.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study reveals that CAP1 enhances the function of PCSK9, 
likely by twisting the protein into a closed configuration that exposes the M2 
subdomain needed for targeting the PCSK9-LDLR complex to degradation 
compartments. We hypothesize that ""protein X"", which is expected to guide the 
LDLR-PCSK9-CAP1 complex to these compartments after endocytosis into 
clathrin-coated vesicles, is HLA-C or a similar MHC-I family member. This 
conclusion is supported by the PCSK9 natural loss-of-function Q554E and 
gain-of-function H553R M2 variants, whose consequences are anticipated by our 
modeling."
827,"AIMS: Increased cardiovascular disease risk underlies elevated rates of 
mortality in individuals with periodontitis. A key characteristic of those with 
increased cardiovascular risk is endothelial dysfunction, a phenomenon 
synonymous with deficiencies of bioavailable nitric oxide (NO), and prominently 
expressed in patients with periodontitis. Also, inorganic nitrate can be reduced 
to NO in vivo to restore NO levels, leading us to hypothesise that it may be 
beneficial in reducing periodontitis-associated endothelial dysfunction. Herein 
we sought to determine whether inorganic nitrate improves endothelial function 
in the setting of periodontitis and if so to determine the mechanisms 
underpinning any responses seen.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Periodontitis was induced in mice by placement of a 
ligature for 14 days around the second molar. Treatment in vivo with potassium 
nitrate, either prior to or following establishment of experimental 
periodontitis, attenuated endothelial dysfunction, as determined by assessment 
of acetylcholine-induced relaxation of aortic rings, compared to control 
(potassium chloride treatment). These beneficial effects were associated with a 
suppression of vascular wall inflammatory pathways (assessed by 
quantitative-PCR), increases in the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 
(IL)-10 and reduced tissue oxidative stress due to attenuation of xanthine 
oxidoreductase-dependent superoxide generation. In patients with periodontitis, 
plasma nitrite levels were not associated with endothelial function indicating 
dysfunction.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that inorganic nitrate protects against, and can 
partially reverse pre-existing, periodontitis-induced endothelial dysfunction 
through restoration of nitrite and thus NO levels. This research highlights the 
potential of dietary nitrate as adjunct therapy to target the associated 
negative cardiovascular outcomes in patients with periodontitis."
828,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): To determine if limiting the doses delivered to the penile 
bulb (PB) and corporal bodies (CB) with IMRT preserves erectile function 
compared to standard IMRT in men with prostate cancer.
MATERIALS/METHODS: 117 patients with low-intermediate risk, clinical T1a-T2c 
prostate adenocarcinoma were enrolled to a single-institution, prospective, 
single blind, phase III randomized trial. All received definitive IMRT to 74-80 
Gy in 37-40 fractions and standard IMRT (s-IMRT) or erectile tissue sparing IMRT 
(ETS-IMRT), which placed additional planning constraints that limited the D90 to 
the PB and CB to ≤ 15 Gy and ≤ 7 Gy, respectively. Erectile potency was assessed 
with components of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and PDE5 
medication records.
RESULTS: 62 patients received ETS-IMRT and 54 received s-IMRT; 1 patient did not 
receive radiation therapy. Prior to treatment, all patients reported erectile 
potency. No patients received androgen deprivation therapy. In the 
intention-to-treat analysis, treatment arms did not differ in potency 
preservation at 24 months (37.1% ETS-IMRT vs 31.5% s-IMRT, p=0.53). Of 85 
evaluable patients with IIEF and PDE5 medication follow-up, erectile potency was 
seen in 47.9% of patients in the ETS-IMRT arm and 46.0% of patients in the 
s-IMRT arm (p=0.86). PDE5 inhibitors were initiated in 41.7% of ETS-IMRT 
patients and 35.1% of s-IMRT patients (p=0.54). Among all patients enrolled, 
there was no difference in freedom from biochemical failure between those 
treated with ETS-IMRT and s-IMRT (5-yr 91.8% vs 90.7%, respectively, p=0.77) 
with a median follow-up of 7.4 years. There were no differences in acute or late 
GI or GU toxicity. An unplanned per-protocol analysis demonstrated no 
differences in potency preservation or secondary endpoints between patients who 
exceeded erectile tissue-sparing constraints and those who met constraints, 
though power was limited by attrition and unplanned dosimetric crossover.
CONCLUSIONS: Erectile tissue sparing IMRT that strictly limits dose to the 
penile bulb and corporal bodies is safe and feasible. Use of this planning 
technique did not show an effect on potency preservation outcomes at 2 years, 
though power to detect a difference was limited."
829,"Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) is a diagnosis which denotes the 
coexistence of pigmentary and vascular birthmarks of specific types, accompanied 
by variable multisystem involvement including central nervous system disease, 
asymmetrical growth and a predisposition to malignancy. Using a tightly 
phenotyped group and high depth next generation sequencing of affected tissues 
we discover here clonal mosaic variants in gene PTPN11 encoding SHP2 phosphatase 
as a cause of PPV type III or spilorosea. Within an individual the same variant 
is found in distinct pigmentary and vascular birthmarks and is undetectable in 
blood. We go on to demonstrate that the same variants can cause either the 
specific pigmentary or vascular phenotypes alone, as well as driving melanoma 
development within the pigmentary lesion. Protein conformational modelling 
highlights that while variants lead to loss of function at the level of the 
phosphatase domain, resultant conformational changes promote longer ligand 
binding. In vitro modelling of the missense variants confirms downstream MAPK 
pathway overactivation, and widespread disruption of human endothelial cell 
angiogenesis. Importantly, PTPN11-mosaic patients theoretically risk passing on 
the variant to their children as the germline RASopathy Noonan syndrome with 
lentigines. These findings improve our understanding of the pathogenesis and 
biology of naevus spilus and capillary malformation syndromes, paving the way 
for better clinical management."
830,"Ectopic prostatic tissue is rare, and it is usually only discovered by chance 
during imaging examinations or surgery. However, between 1967 and 2021, reports 
of ectopic prostatic tissue in the medical literature increased. It is rarely 
reported that ectopic prostatic tissue can be misdiagnosed as a nephrogenic 
adenoma (NA). This case study aimed to increase the awareness of ectopic 
prostatic tissue to improve its rates of diagnosis. This paper is focused on a 
45-year-old male patient with a history of bladder lesions that were 
accidentally discovered through a health examination. A computed tomography scan 
revealed a homogeneous isoechoic mass in the posterior inferior wall of the 
bladder. At first, a transurethral cystoscopy revealed a smooth sessile mass 
covering the normal bladder mucosa, which was located in the middle of the 
interureteric ridge. The biopsy results suggested a possible intravesical NA. 
The mass was then completely resected under pneumovesicoscopy, and the 
pathological diagnosis was ectopic prostatic tissue. The clinical symptoms of 
ectopic prostatic tissue are similar to other bladder neoplasms, but there are 
too few characteristics available in imaging examinations to allow for an 
accurate diagnosis. Since ectopic prostatic tissue can present as a tumor in the 
bladder, urologists may easily misdiagnose the condition. Surgery is the basis 
of treatment for ectopic prostatic tissue, and it has a good prognosis."
831,"Conventional techniques for in vitro cancer drug screening require 
labor-intensive formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, and dye staining of tumor 
tissues at fixed endpoints. This way of assessment discards the valuable 
pharmacodynamic information in live cells over time. Here, we found endogenous 
lipofuscin-like autofluorescence acutely accumulated in the cell death process. 
Its unique red autofluorescence could report the apoptosis without labeling and 
continuously monitor the treatment responses in 3D tumor-culture models. 
Lifetime imaging of lipofuscin-like red autofluorescence could further 
distinguish necrosis from apoptosis of cells. Moreover, this endogenous 
fluorescent marker could visualize the apoptosis in live zebrafish embryos 
during development. Overall, this study validates that lipofuscin-like 
autofluorophore is a generic cell death marker. Its characteristic 
autofluorescence could label-free predict the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs in 
organoids or animal models."
832,"BACKGROUND: Molecular factors influence relapse patterns in glioblastoma. The 
hotspot mutation located at position 289 of the extracellular domain of the 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRA289mut) is associated with a more 
infiltrative phenotype. The primary objective of this study was to explore the 
impact of the EGFRA289 mutation on the pattern of relapse after 
chemoradiotherapy-based treatment of patients suffering from newly diagnosed 
glioblastoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: An ancillary study from a prospective cohort of patients 
suffering from glioblastoma was conducted. All patients received radiotherapy 
and concomitant temozolomide. The population was divided into two groups 
according to EGFRA289 status (mutated versus wild-type). The primary endpoint 
was the overlap score (varying from 0 to 1) between the initial irradiated tumor 
volume (Vinit) and the relapse volume (Vr). Secondary endpoints explored the 
impact of EGFRA289mut on survival.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-eight patients were included and analyzed: 11% had 
EGFRA289mut glioblastoma (n = 14/128). EGFRA289mut glioblastomas had a relapse 
pattern that was more marginal than EGFRA289wt glioblastomas: a median overlap 
score Vinit/Vr of 0.96 was observed in the EGFRA289mut group versus 1 in the 
EGFRA289wt group (P = 0.05). Half of the population with EGFRA289mut tumor (n = 
7/14) had a marginal relapse (i.e. overlap scoreVr/Vinit ≤ 0.95) compared to 
23.7% (n = 27/114) in the EGFRA289wt group, P = 0.035. EGFRA289mut did not 
influence survival.
CONCLUSION: We highlighted a link between the EGFRA289 mutation and the relapse 
pattern in glioblastoma. The independent role of EGFRA289mut and its clinical 
implication should now be explored in further studies."
833,"INTRODUCTION: To retrospectively analyzed our twenty-years single-center 
experience in the treatment of PPS tumors, focusing on the selection of surgical 
approach and the survival outcome.
METHODS: Tumors involving the PPS between January 2000 and February 2022 were 
retrospectively included. The surgical approach was dictated by the localization 
of the tumor, its dimensions, the relation to anatomic structures and its 
etiology.
RESULTS: 34 patients were included in the study. The median age was 50.5 yr, 
with a gender female prevalence. Most tumors were benign and non recurrent. 20 
tumors were treated through lateral approach (transcervical or 
transcervical-transparotid), 11 through medial approach (transoral), and only 3 
tumors were approached by multiple corridors. The 5 years disease free survival 
(DFS) was 78.8 % (CI 78-79.3 %).
CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the transcervical and transoral approaches can 
be considered the ideal surgical approach to manage tumors of PPS, especially in 
cases of benign neoplasms."
834,"INTRODUCTION: National guidelines recommend against routine axillary staging 
with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in women 
≥70 y with early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer 
and clinically negative axilla; however, these practices remain common.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective pilot study from August 2021 to 2022 using 
an intervention targeting breast surgeons and radiation oncologists in Michigan 
that aimed to reduce SLNB and RT in eligible patients. The intervention 
consisted of (1) a geriatric assessment, (2) an assessment of the patient's 
medical maximizing-minimizing preferences, and (3) a tailored script with 
counterpoints to reasons patients commonly seek SLNB or RT. At the end of the 
study period, participants completed a survey providing feedback with the 
primary outcomes being: acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and 
intention and motivation to use the materials based on validated measures.
RESULTS: Participants (n = 23) included 15 breast surgeons and 8 radiation 
oncologists. Collectively, the materials were used with 115 patients. 
Considering all materials holistically, acceptability, appropriateness, and 
feasibility of the intervention were high; participants also intended and were 
motivated to use the intervention. Scores across all measures were highest for 
the geriatric assessment and lowest for the tailored script. The major barriers 
to using the intervention were limited time and instances of disagreement on 
treatment recommendations among surgeons and radiation oncologists.
CONCLUSIONS: The omission of SLNB and adjuvant RT should be discussed in 
appropriately selected patients. A multifaceted provider-level deimplementation 
strategy may be an effective means for achieving this goal."
835,"Vitamin C is an essential vitamin that acts as a co-factor for many enzymes 
involved in epigenetic regulation in humans. Low vitamin C levels in 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) promote self-renewal and vitamin C 
supplementation retards leukaemogenesis in vitamin C-deficient mouse models. 
Studies on vitamin C levels in patients with myeloid malignancies are limited. 
We thus conducted a retrospective analysis on a prospective cohort of patients 
with myeloid malignancies on whom plasma vitamin C levels were measured serially 
at diagnosis and during treatment. Baseline characteristics including 
hematological indices, cytogenetics, and molecular mutations are described in 
this cohort. Among 64 patients included in our study, 11 patients (17%) had low 
vitamin C levels. We noted a younger age at diagnosis for patients with myeloid 
malignancies who had low plasma vitamin C levels. Patients with low plasma 
vitamin C levels were more likely to have acute myeloid leukemia compared to 
other myeloid malignancies. Low vitamin C levels were associated with ASXL1 
mutations. Our study calls for further multi-institutional studies to understand 
the relevance of low plasma vitamin C level in myeloid neoplasms, the role of 
vitamin C deficiency in leukemogenesis, and the potential benefit of vitamin C 
supplementation."
836,"BACKGROUND: Estimating the risk for cirrhosis in the general population is 
complex. Existing prediction tools are in general unsatisfactory.
AIMS: To explore if using commonly available biomarkers can improve the commonly 
used FIB-4 score in the identification of subgroups at risk of cirrhosis.
METHODS: We used laboratory and clinical data on 126,925 individuals aged 
35-79 years in Stockholm, Sweden, undergoing health examinations from 1985 to 
1996. We used Swedish nationwide registries to ascertain 10-year cumulative 
incidence of severe liver disease, a composite of diagnoses corresponding to 
cirrhosis and its complications. We considered combinations of biomarkers 
associated with severe liver disease to identify subgroups with different risk 
profiles.
RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 9.3 years, we ascertained 630 incident 
cases of severe liver disease (0.5%). Age, the FIB-4 score, diabetes or impaired 
glucose and gamma-glutamyl transferase (gGT) were the most relevant 
characteristics for classifying risk profiles. Using these factors, we 
identified 24 groups with a cumulative incidence of severe liver disease at 
10 years ranging from 0.2% (age 35-65, low FIB-4, no diabetes or impaired 
glucose and normal gGT) to 32.1% (age 35-65, high FIB-4, diabetes or impaired 
glucose and high gGT).
CONCLUSIONS: Identification of subjects at increased risk of severe liver 
disease in the general population using the FIB-4 score can be substantially 
improved by adding age and specific biomarkers commonly available in the primary 
care setting. These parameters should be considered for inclusion in the 
development of future risk prediction models."
837,"This study presents a new idea for estimating the number of measurements 
required for determining the uncertainty in obtaining the desired water absorbed 
dose using the variation obtained from multicenter absorbed dose measurement 
data. The number of dose measurements depends on the performance of each linear 
accelerator (LINAC) tested and the dosimetry equipment and procedure used. 
However, optimising the number of data collected for the absorbed dose to water 
has been inadequately reported. Using the absorbed dose measurement data 
collected 10 times as a reference value, we will compare the changes in the 
variation of the measurement results caused by the difference in the number of 
repeated measurements of the absorbed dose. The number of measurements is 
determined statistically such that this variation would be smaller than the 
change in absorbed dose. Thus, we can determine the optimum number of 
measurements suitable for the variability of each LINAC."
838,"BACKGROUND: Breast reconstruction following oncological resection is becoming 
more common in recent years. In some ladies, implant reconstruction is not ideal 
due to significant implant visibility or palpability. Autologous reconstruction 
addresses the limitations of implant reconstruction but results in potential 
donor site morbidities. To date, there is no clear advantage ascribed to any 
technique. With appropriate selection, patients with adequate lateral mammary 
fold have the option of reconstruction with MCW-LICAP flap. We present our 
techniques and outcomes from a series of 29 patients who underwent MCW-LICAP 
flap.
METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent curative 
resection for breast cancer with immediate MCW-LICAP flap reconstruction, 
between July 2018 to April 2022 was conducted. The techniques used with its 
variations along with video demonstrations are presented.
RESULTS: A total of 29 patients underwent 34 procedures. Nineteen breast 
conserving surgeries and 15 mastectomies were completed, and immediate 
reconstruction performed in all cases. Twenty-three patients had MCW-LICAP, 1 
with a Stacked intercostal artery perforator (STICAP) flap, and 5 had MCW-LICAP 
combined with a Goldilocks mastectomy. There were no cases of complications 
requiring re-operation. All patients had acceptable time to adjuvant therapy 
with a median of 36 days. Learning curve analysis showed a significant reduction 
in operative time after the 6th case.
CONCLUSION: In our preliminary experience, MCW-LICAP flap is a safe, reliable, 
and versatile oncoplastic reconstruction option."
839,"BACKGROUND: As part of a breast-conservation strategy for breast cancer, there 
are presently no data from randomized controlled studies on the use of 
intraoperative radiation (IORT) as a tumor bed boost. The effectiveness and 
safety of IORT as a boost therapy at a tertiary cancer center were 
retrospectively reviewed in this study.
METHODS: Patients had breast-conserving surgery from 2012 to 2016 that included 
staging of the axillary lymph nodes, a single dose of 20 Gy IORT with 50-kV 
photons, whole-breast irradiation (WBI), and (neo-)adjuvant systemic treatment 
(if applicable). During the follow-up patients were monitored for the assessment 
of acute and late toxicities (using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events version 4.03). Results included ipsilateral (IBTR), contralateral (CBE), 
and distant metastasis-free (DMFS) breast progression-free survival, as well as 
overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: The 68 patients had a median follow-up of 91.5 months (with a range of 
9-125). Most patients (n = 51) had T1 disease and were clinically node negative. 
Only a small number of individuals had triple negative or high-grade illness. 
The majority of patients had sentinel node biopsy, and three (4.4%) had to have 
their tumors removed again since their original margins were positive. Finally, 
there were no distinct tumor bed margins. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 
administered to ten (14.7%). The median duration from BCS to WBI was 54.5 days, 
and conventionally fractionated WBI was used to accomplish WBI most frequently 
(n = 57, 96.6%). IORT was administered in a single 20 Gy dosage. 50 Gy was the 
median WBI dosage (range 40.05-50.4 Gy). There were no grade 4 adverse events 
for any patients in. Toxicities following surgery were minimal. There were only 
one patient with grade 3 toxicity (radiation dermatitis) to observe. Five tumor 
bed recurrences and two contralateral breast incident each occurred.
CONCLUSION: This work adds to the preliminary evidence already in the literature 
and supports the use of IORT in boost settings. When randomized trials like 
TARGIT-B are eventually published, these hopeful findings should be 
prospectively evaluated."
840,"The robotic platform can overcome technical difficulties associated with 
laparoscopic colon surgery. Transitioning from laparoscopic right colectomy with 
extracorporeal anastomosis (ECA) to robotic right colectomy with intracorporeal 
anastomosis (ICA) is associated with a learning phase. This study aimed at 
determining the length of this learning phase and its associated morbidity. We 
retrospectively analyzed all laparoscopic right colectomies with ECA (n = 38) 
and robotic right colectomies with ICA (n = 67) for (pre)malignant lesions 
performed by a single surgeon between January 2014 and December 2020. CUSUM-plot 
analysis of total procedure time was used for learning curve determination of 
robotic colectomies. Non-parametric tests were used for statistical analysis. 
Compared to laparoscopy, the learning phase robotic right colectomies (n = 35) 
had longer procedure times (p < 0.001) but no differences in anastomotic leakage 
rate, length of stay or 30-day morbidity. Conversion rate was reduced from 16 to 
3 percent in the robotic group. This study provides evidence that robotic right 
colectomy with ICA can be safely implemented without increasing morbidity."
841,"This study systematically analyzed the contents, compositions, and sources of 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in river sediments near an important 
energy and chemical base in northwest China. In addition, their possible adverse 
effects on the ecology and human health were assessed. The PAH concentrations in 
this study area ranged from 2641.28 to 16783.72 (ng/g dw). PAHs of medium 
molecular weight (3-ring and 4-ring) showed the largest proportion, followed by 
PAHs of higher molecular weight (5-ring and 6-ring). The results of molecular 
diagnostic ratios and principal component analysis revealed that PAHs in the 
region have complex sources, with incomplete combustion of local fossil fuels 
and traffic exhaust factors being the main sources. The total toxic equivalent 
concentration of PAHs varied from 10.05 to 760.26 ng/g, and according to the 
sediment quality guidelines, PAHs have high potential ecological risk in the 
lower reaches of the river. The mean effect range-median quotient for the region 
was 0.46, and the combined ecological risk was at moderate to high levels (21% 
probability of toxicity). The lifetime carcinogenic risks for adults and 
children exposed to PAHs were 2.95 × 10-3 and 1.87 × 10-2, respectively, which 
are much higher than the limit of 10-4, indicating moderate to high potential 
cancer risks. Therefore, the local government should consider taking some 
environmental remediation measures. This study can provide theoretical support 
for pollution prevention measures and ecological restoration strategies for 
rivers in resource-rich areas."
842,"PURPOSE: Astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas are mainly diffuse primary brain 
tumors harboring a diagnostic and prognostically favorable isocitrate 
dehydrogenase mutation. They are still incurable besides growing molecular 
knowledge and therapy options. Circumscribed astrocytomas are also discussed 
here, although they represent a separate entity despite similarities in the 
nomenclature.
METHODS: We reviewed clinical trials, preclinical approaches as well as 
guideline recommendations form the major scientific Neuro-Oncology organizations 
for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas according to PRISMA guidelines.
RESULTS: After histopathological diagnosis and eventually a maximal safe 
resection, patients with good prognostic factors may be followed by magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). If further treatment is necessary, either after 
diagnosis or at progression, diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas are 
mainly treated with combined radiochemotherapy or maximal safe resection 
followed by combined radiochemotherapy according to current guidelines based on 
randomized trials. Circumscribed gliomas like pilocytic astrocytomas, CNS WHO 
grade 1, or pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, CNS WHO grade 2, are often treated 
with surgery alone. Current approaches for therapy optimization include decision 
of the best chemotherapy regimen. The IDH mutation presents a rational target 
for small molecule inhibition and immune therapy in diffuse astrocytomas and 
oligodendrogliomas, while the BRAF pathway is frequently mutated and treatable 
in circumscribed gliomas.
CONCLUSION: Despite establishment of standard treatment approaches for gliomas 
that include resection, radio- and chemotherapy, there is a lack of effective 
treatments for progressive disease. Immune- and targeted therapies are currently 
investigated."
843,"PURPOSE: Intradural spinal hemangioblastomas are rare highly hypervascularized 
benign neoplasms. Surgical resection remains the treatment of choice, with a 
significant risk of postoperative neurological deterioration. Due to the tumor 
infrequency, scientific evidence is scarce and limited to case reports and small 
case series.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter study including five 
high-volume neurosurgical centers analyzing patients surgically treated for 
spinal hemangioblastomas between 2006 and 2021. We assessed clinical status, 
surgical data, preoperative angiograms, and embolization when available. 
Follow-up records were analyzed, and logistic regression performed to assess 
possible risk factors for neurological deterioration.
RESULTS: We included 60 patients in Germany and Austria. Preoperative 
angiography was performed in 30% of the cases; 10% of the patients underwent 
preoperative embolization. Posterior tumor location and presence of a syrinx 
favored gross total tumor resection (93.8% vs. 83.3% and 97.1% vs. 84%). 
Preoperative embolization was not associated with postoperative worsening. The 
clinical outcome revealed a transient postoperative neurological deterioration 
in 38.3%, depending on symptom duration and preoperative modified McCormick 
grading, but patients recovered in most cases until follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Spinal hemangioblastoma patients significantly benefit from early 
surgical treatment with only transient postoperative deterioration and complete 
recovery until follow-up. The performance of preoperative angiograms remains 
subject to center disparities."
844,"Peripheral blood eosinophilia is associated with a variety of benign and 
neoplastic conditions. Rarely, marked eosinophilia can mask an underlying Acute 
Leukaemia, delaying the correct diagnosis and treatment. Here, we report a case 
of 14-year-old boy, who presented with marked eosinophilia and space occupying 
lesion in the brain. Bone marrow biopsy and biopsy of brain lesion were 
performed to assess the underlying disorder, revealing the unexpected diagnosis 
of Precursor B- Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in this patient. Cytogenetic 
studies revealed a normal male karyotype. This case highlights the significance 
of considering the rare possibility of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia among the 
differential diagnosis of persistent eosinophilia in order to facilitate prompt 
and appropriate treatment."
845,"Papillary renal cell carcinoma comprises around 15% of all renal cell 
carcinomas. Patients are usually asymptomatic, and 25 percent of individuals 
have advanced locoregional disease at presentation. Papillary renal cell 
carcinoma presenting as a huge abdominal cystic mass is uncommon and is reported 
rarely in literature. We present a case of renal cell carcinoma presenting with 
abdominal pain, distention, and constipation. A retroperitoneal cystic lesion 
measuring 23.4×23.8 cm cyst was reported on ultrasonography as potential cause 
of the symptoms. We now talk about the case of a 57- year-old male who presented 
to us with abdominal pain, distension, and constipation. He also had a history 
of on and off low-grade fever for the last seven months. A computed topography 
(CT scan) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast revealed 
a large retroperitoneal cystic mass extending from the left hypochondrium to the 
left kidney and into the pelvis crossing the midline. Internal calcific foci, 
enhancing septa, irregularly thickened walls and hyperdense nodules were also 
demonstrated. A radical left nephrectomy via a midline laparotomy was performed 
electively. The cystic mass was excised and the specimen was sent for 
histopathological evaluation which revealed papillary renal cell carcinoma with 
PAX-8 and CK-7 positivity. Patient made an uneventful recovery post-operatively 
and was discharged. Cystic tumors of renal origin can rarely present as a huge 
abdominal cystic mass confusing them for masses of intestinal or hepatic origin. 
Timely diagnosis can be made with a detailed history, examination, imaging 
studies and histopathology, and instigate timely intervention."
846,"Central catheterization can be placed in critically ill patients in the 
intensive care unit (ICU) for some purposes such as dialysis, nutrition, and 
hemodynamic monitoring. Air embolism is a very rare complication of central 
catheterization. A 46-year-old male patient with no known comorbidities 
underwent laparoscopic total colectomy and protective loop ileostomy for colon 
cancer. He was taken to the general surgery ICU for close hemodynamic follow-up 
in the postoperative period. Since he was cachectic and could not reach the 
target of oral nutrition within 1 week, a central catheter was inserted in the 
right internal jugular vein with ultrasonographic imaging, and total parenteral 
nutrition (TPN) was started. The patient, who had no additional problems in the 
follow-up, was transferred to the general surgery ward. Three and half hours 
after the transfer, the patient became unconscious and had extensor posture. 
Therefore, emergency cranial computed tomography (CT) was performed and he was 
taken back to the ICU. There was no finding in favour of bleeding in cranial CT. 
The patient was intubated to protect the airway, as he had a generalized 
tonic-clonic seizure during his follow-up. Air bubbles were seen in the main 
pulmonary artery and right ventricle in the multidetector thorax CT. Cranial CT 
angiography was taken at the 24th hour, and diffusion cranial MRI was performed 
for diagnosis of central air embolism. No air was detected to be aspirated in 
the cerebral arteries in cranial CT angiography. On the 6th day, the patient 
regained consciousness, extubated, and physical therapy was started. On the 12th 
day of hospitalization, the patient was discharged with 2/5 loss of motor power 
in the left upper extremity. When the patient's wife's anamnesis was detailed, 
it was learned that in order to mobilize the patient, she separated the TPN from 
the catheter and left the catheter tip open."
847,"BACKGROUND: Cross-cultural adaptation and validation are important for the 
reliable use of a scale. This study was conducted to translate and validate the 
polycystic ovarian syndrome quality of life scale (PCOSQOL) in Pashto.
METHODS: This study was conducted in tertiary care teaching hospitals of 
Peshawar from August to December 2021 on 333 patients diagnosed with polycystic 
ovarian syndrome. Using forward-backward method, three bilingual experts 
translated PCOSQOL from English to Pashto. The exploratory and confirmatory 
factor analyses, Cronbach alpha reliability and construct validity of PCOSQOL 
(Pashto version) was found out using SPSS version 25 and AMOS version 26 for 
data analysis.
RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 25.73±5.89 years. Majority were married 
(n=260, 78.1%), uneducated (n=180, 54.1%) and unemployed (n=303, 91%). Factorial 
validity of the Pashto version showed it to be a five-factor model. Regarding 
construct validity, the factor loading through Item total correlation scores 
revealed highly satisfactory correlation coefficients. The Cronbach's alpha 
reliability of the Pashto version of PCOSQOL was 0.918. The confirmatory factor 
analysis (CFA) indicated a good fit model with a CFI of 0.91 and a RMSEA value 
of .08. Poor quality of life (89.98±28.5) was reported in 169 (50.8%) women and 
this was irrespective of their educational and occupational background (p>0.05) 
respectively. Pearson coefficient correlation test showed a significantly 
positive Inter-scale correlation (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Pashto version of PCOSQOL is a reliable instrument to measure the 
quality of life in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome and can be used in 
Pashto speaking patients."
848,"BACKGROUND: Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is an uncommon neoplasm of mature 
B-lymphoid cells which is characterized by cytopenias, commonly of all three 
cell lines, with typical hairy cells on peripheral smear and/or bone marrow 
along with organomegaly. Objective was to document the outcomes of HCL patients 
treated at a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan.
METHODS: Medical records of patients from 2004 to 2020 were reviewed and data 
was collected to assess patient's demographics, symptomatology, remission rate 
and overall survival. The record flies of all patients presenting to AFBMTC with 
HCL were included in the study. The record file with insufficient data were 
excluded.
RESULTS: 26 patients with a mean age of 48.12±11.43 years were diagnosed with 
HCL and treated at AFBMTC. Out of these, 23 (88.4%) were male and 03 (11.5%) 
females. The main presenting complaints were generalized body aches (34.6%), 
fever (15.4%), incidental finding of cytopenias (11.5%) and abdominal discomfort 
(26.9%). Splenomegaly was found in 76.92% while hepatomegaly was found in 46.15% 
of patients. A total of 12 (46.15%) patients received Cladribine (either 
intravenous or subcutaneous) and splenectomy was done in 7 (26.92%) as 1st line 
treatment. Eleven patients out of 12 (83.33%) who received Cladribine and 05 
(71.42%) patients out of seven who underwent splenectomy; achieved complete 
remission (CR) after 1 st line of treatment. One patient received Cladribine as 
1st line of treatment but did not respond and CHOP regimen was given as second 
line. Out of the 26 patients, 5 patients (19.23%) relapsed at a median interval 
of 5.83±6.6 years. Two patients received Cladribine + Rituximab while 03 
patients received cladribine as their salvage therapy. Disease free survival 
(DFS) of 71.4% among the patients underwent splenectomy while 75.0% among the 
patients received Cladribine. DFS for combination therapy (included CHOP and 
CVP) was 66.7% while OS was calculated among patients who received cladribine, 
splenectomy and combination chemotherapy as 100%, 85.7%, 66.7% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Cladribine has a significant efficacy and encouraging acute and 
long-term benefits when administered to patients with HCL. A single course of 
cladribine was able to induce CR in a vast majority of patients. At a median 
follow up of 4.6 years the OS was 100% with cladribine and 85% with splenectomy. 
Those who relapsed were successfully retreated with cladribine + Rituximab."
849,"BACKGROUND: Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) characterized by t (15;17) 
leading to formation of fusion protein PML-RARA is an acute leukaemia with 
highest mortality. A remarkable improvement in the outcomes has been witnessed 
due to evolution of highly effective targeted therapies replacing the 
traditional chemotherapy is most patients. However limited data is available 
regarding treatment outcomes of APL using various novel regimens from developing 
countries like Pakistan.
METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive study which included APL patients 
treated at AFBMTC Rawalpindi from 2005 to 2020. It included a total of 51 
eligible patients with a diagnosis of de novo APL confirmed by the presence of 
PML-RARA transcript or presence of t (15;17) by cytogenetics or FISH analysis. 
The protocols used for treatment included the UKAML MRC 12, the LPA-99/LPA-2005 
PETHEMA, the APML4 and non-chemotherapy based ATO-ATRA protocol.
RESULTS: The study included 51 patients in which 31 (60.78%) were male and 20 
(39.2%) were female. The median age at diagnosis was 30 years (range 5-70). The 
commonest symptom was fever seen in 43 (84.3%) patients and bruising was the 
commonest physical finding present in 44 (86.3%) patients. High-risk patients 
were 23 (46.1%), 18 (35.3%) were intermediate risk and 10 (19.6%) were low risk. 
The LPA99/LPA2005 was most frequently employed protocol being used in 36 (72%) 
patients. There were 2 deaths during induction and 44 (86.3%) achieved CR post 
induction. The median follow up time was 32 months (range 1 to 190 months) with 
an overall survival (OS) of 76.5% and a relapse free survival (RFS) of 66.7.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows APL is a highly curable malignancy and outcomes 
have improved with newer non chemotherapy based therapies. It can also be 
concluded that outcomes of APL gradually improved over the past 2 decades due to 
improvement in supportive care, provision of blood products and use of newer 
protocols. The prognosis remains less favourable in high risk patients."
850,"BACKGROUND: Thanks to progressive technology and modern innovations, 
laparoscopic procedures, being minimally invasive, have now supervened upon most 
open surgical procedures. Laparoscopic procedures have proven advantages over 
open procedures. The study was designed to compare the outcomes of laparoscopic 
nephrectomy between 3D and 4K camera resolutions.
METHODS: This randomized control trial carried out at Tabba Kidney institute, 
Karachi, Pakistan from July 2020 to April 2021, to our knowledge was the first 
of its kind comparative study in Pakistan and internationally. All patients 
diagnosed to have symptomatic non-functioning kidney on the basis of both renal 
scintigraphy and CT- KUB were divided through blocked randomization in to two 
different camera resolution groups, i.e., 3D vs 4K and outcomes in terms of 
operative time, haemoglobin fall, post procedure complications and in patient 
stay were recorded.
RESULTS: It was observed that the 3D group had a significantly shorter mean 
total operative time 172.1±36.9 vs 272.5±14.1 respectively (p<0.005). A 
significant difference was also observed in mean operative time for task 2 was 
53.1±21.1 & 101±30.9 mins (p<0.005), and for task 3 was 67.18±18.3 & 112.5±37 
mins (p=0.005) for 3D and 4K groups respectively. The mean haemoglobin drops in 
3D and 4K groups was 0.51±1.6 & 0.73±1.1 respectively (p=0.7). Moreover, the 
mean hospital stay was 2.5±0.6 for 3D group & 2.7±0.9 for 4K group (p-value 
0.8). Post-operative wound infection was observed in one patient in each group. 
No case had to be converted to surgery by an open approach.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that despite being the latest technological 
advancement with a greater zooming capability, when used for performing 
laparoscopic nephrectomy, 4K imaging system couldn't show any superiority over 
3D imaging system, in different operative tasks and in terms of total operative 
time."
851,"Cervical cancer which is caused by persistent infection with oncogenic human 
papillomavirus (HPV), is the third most common cancer. HPV infection causes the 
progression of the normal cervix to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 
because it often occurs at the function conversion of the cervical squamous 
epithelium and columnar epithelium zone, further to invasive carcinoma. The 
difference in the ALDH1 expression was very significant. With the progression of 
cervical cancer, reports explained obviously increased nuclear and cytoplasm 
ALDH1 staining in comparisons of cervical carcinomas and normal cervix (P < 
0.0001), cervical carcinomas compared with CIN (P = 0.0002). Therefore, ALDH1 as 
a stem marker, not only resists cervical cancer but also resists in normal 
cervix and CIN tissues. Developing an experimental method to discover cervical 
cancer earlier is feasible. Furthermore, the ALDH1 was expressed in human 
cervical cancer cell lines (Hela, SiHa, CaSki, HT-3, and C33A) together with 
western blot and immunocytochemical analysis. ALDH1 plays a significant role in 
nuclear and cytoplasm staining by immunochemistry in single or clustered HT-3 
and C33A cells. However, western blot and immunochemical analysis did not detect 
ALDH1 in HeLa or CaSki, SiHa cells. We also discovered that there were no 
remarkable differences in age, tumor size, clinical TNM staging, multiple pelvic 
lymph node metastasis, or histological staging (p > 0.05) between the 
ALDH1-positive groups in 100 cervical cancer tissues. But after the control 
variable age, different ALDH rating survival function contrasted, it can be 
concluded that the higher ALDH1 scores with the survival of patients with the 
worse condition."
852,"Extra-nodal localisations of mantle cell lymphomas are most frequently found in 
the gastrointestinal tract. It is therefore important for an endoscopist to be 
familiar with the endoscopic image of a mantle cell lymphoma. In this case 
series of three patients with colonic involvement of mantle cell lymphoma, we 
discuss the endoscopic diagnosis."
853,"Anal cancer is an uncommon malignancy, comprising only 2.5% of all 
gastrointestinal malignancies and similar to cervical cancer, the human 
papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for the majority of anal cancers. Over the 
last decades there has been an up to 3-fold increased incidence seen in specific 
populations at risk such as persons living with HIV (PLWH), men who have sex 
with men (MSM), woman diagnosed with HPV-related gynaecological precancerous 
lesions or cancer, solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) and patients with 
autoimmune diseases. Although international practice is evolving increasingly 
towards active screening for and treatment of anal cancer precursors in at-risk 
groups, currently no organised screening program is in effect in Belgium. 
Currently, differerent screening options as well as treatment modalities are 
available. Before commencing a nationwide organised screening program, essential 
decisions on screening strategies need to be made, based on both scientific as 
well as financial and logistical facts."
854,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Over the last 20 years, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) 
combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has 
progressively become a therapeutic option for peritoneal carcinomatosis thanks 
to its favourable oncologic results. The aim of this study is to analyse the 
overall survival and recurrence-free survival, after complete CRS and closed 
abdomen technique HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study collected the data from all 
patients who underwent a CRS with HIPEC for colorectal cancer at ""Cliniques 
universitaires Saint Luc"" from October 2007 to December 2020. Ninety-nine 
patients were included.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 34 months. Post-operative mortality and 
Clavien-Dindo grade III/IV morbidity rates were 2.0% and 28.3%. The overall 
2-year and 5-year survival rates were 80.1% and 54.4%. Using the multivariate 
analysis, age at surgery, liver metastases and PCI score >13 showed a 
statistically significant negative impact on overall survival. The 2-year and 
5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 33.9% and 22%. Using the multivariate 
analysis, it was found that liver metastases, the extent of carcinomatosis with 
PCI>7 have a statistically significant negative impact on recurrence-free 
survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high recurrence rate, CRS followed by HIPEC to treat 
peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal origin offer encouraging oncologic 
results with a satisfying survival rate. When PCI>13, CRS and HIPEC does not 
seem to offer any survival benefit and to efficiently limit recurrence, our data 
are in favor of a maximum PCI of 7."
855,"Primary lymphomatoid granulomatosis of the CNS (CNS-LG) is a rare lymphoid 
neoplasia associated Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and often accompanied by 
immunodeficiencies. No treatment standards have been defined yet. However, due 
to often devastating neurologic sequelae and based on similarities to diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma, curative treatment requires intensive therapy protocols 
resembling protocols applied in CNS lymphoma. Here, the clinical courses and 
treatments of four primary CNS-LG patients in analogy to aggressive 
CNS-lymphomas including methotrexate, thiotepa, cytarabine, carmustine, and 
rituximab are presented. This is the first report on high-dose chemotherapy with 
CNS-directed drugs and autologous blood stem cell transplantation in 
primary CNS-LG."
856,"MDM4 is an important p53-negative regulator, consequently, it is involved in 
cell proliferation, DNA repair, and apoptosis regulation. MDM4 overexpression 
and amplification are described to lead to cancer formation, metastasis, and 
poor disease prognosis. Several MDM4 SNPs are in non-coding regions, and some 
affect the MDM4 regulation by disrupting the micro RNA binding site in 3'UTR 
(untranslated region). Here, we gathered several association studies with 
different MDM4 SNPs and populations to understand the relationship between its 
SNPs and solid tumor risk. Many studies failed to replicate their results 
regarding different populations, cancer types, and risk genotypes, leading to 
conflicting conclusions. We suggested that distinct haplotype patterns in 
different populations might affect the association between MDM4 SNPs and cancer 
risk. Thus, we propose to investigate some linkage SNPs in specific haplotypes 
to provide informative MDM4 markers for association studies with cancer."
857,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy nonspecifically targets both tumor and healthy 
proliferating cells. Methionine deprivation using L-methioninase along with 
chemotherapy appears promising towards cancer management. The present study is 
an attempt to use a new combination of L-methioninase with Tamoxifen (TAM) to 
treat breast cancer in mice.
METHODS AND RESULTS: L-Methioninase from Methylobacterium sp. was partially 
purified (SPMet's) by cold acetone precipitation and lyophilized. Its 
cytotoxicity effect, alone and in combination with Tamoxifen, was evaluated in 
vitro (MCF-7) cells and in vivo (athymic nude mice) conditions. SPMet's was 
found to inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells with an IC50 value of 47.05 µg/ml, 
while the combination of SPMet's and TAM had an IC50 of 6.4 µg/ml. Athymic nude 
mice were grouped into: Group-I - Tumor control; Group-II - TAM; Group-III - 
SPMet's; Group-IV - SPMet's + TAM. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was maximum in 
Group-IV with 84.65% followed by Group-II with 65.12%. Hematological and 
Biochemical parameters in Group-II, III, and IV were restored to normal levels. 
Tumor histopathology showed increased apoptosis and necrosis in Group-IV. 
Caspases 3 & 8 gene upregulation was significantly higher in Group-IV than other 
treated groups, indicating higher efficacy of the combination approach.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study report about a combination of SPMet's and 
TAM on in vivo breast cancer model, with significantly higher anticancer 
activity and without noticeable side effects. The findings of this study have 
several important implications for future clinical studies."
858,"PURPOSE: Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) represents a significant 
concern for patients following breast cancer treatment, and assessment for BCRL 
represents a key component of survivorship efforts. Growing data has 
demonstrated the benefits of early detection and treatment of BCRL. Traditional 
diagnostic modalities are less able to detect reversible subclinical BCRL while 
newer techniques such as bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) have shown the ability 
to detect subclinical BCRL, allowing for early intervention and low rates of 
chronic BCRL with level I evidence. We present updated clinical practice 
guidelines for BIS utilization to assess for BCRL.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Review of the literature identified a randomized controlled 
trial and other published data which form the basis for the recommendations 
made. The final results of the PREVENT trial, with 3-year follow-up, 
demonstrated an absolute reduction of 11.3% and relative reduction of 59% in 
chronic BCRL (through utilization of compression garment therapy) with BIS as 
compared to tape measurement. This is in keeping with real-world data 
demonstrating the effectiveness of BIS in a prospective surveillance model. For 
optimal outcomes patients should receive an initial pre-treatment measurement 
and subsequently be followed at a minimum quarterly for first 3 years then 
biannually for years 4-5, then annually as appropriate, consistent with previous 
guidelines; the target for intervention has been changed from a change in 
L-Dex of 10 to 6.5. The lack of pre-operative measure does not preclude 
inclusion in the prospective surveillance model of care.
CONCLUSION: The updated clinical practice guidelines present a standardized 
approach for a prospective model of care using BIS for BCRL assessment and 
supported by evidence from a randomized controlled trial as well as real-world 
data."
859,"Recent evidence suggests that the prognostic impact of gene mutations in 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may differ depending on the 
immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene somatic hypermutation (SHM) status. In 
this study, we assessed the impact of nine recurrently mutated genes (BIRC3, 
EGR2, MYD88, NFKBIE, NOTCH1, POT1, SF3B1, TP53, and XPO1) in pre-treatment 
samples from 4580 patients with CLL, using time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) as the 
primary end-point in relation to IGHV gene SHM status. Mutations were detected 
in 1588 (34.7%) patients at frequencies ranging from 2.3-9.8% with mutations in 
NOTCH1 being the most frequent. In both univariate and multivariate analyses, 
mutations in all genes except MYD88 were associated with a significantly shorter 
TTFT. In multivariate analysis of Binet stage A patients, performed separately 
for IGHV-mutated (M-CLL) and unmutated CLL (U-CLL), a different spectrum of gene 
alterations independently predicted short TTFT within the two subgroups. While 
SF3B1 and XPO1 mutations were independent prognostic variables in both U-CLL and 
M-CLL, TP53, BIRC3 and EGR2 aberrations were significant predictors only in 
U-CLL, and NOTCH1 and NFKBIE only in M-CLL. Our findings underscore the need for 
a compartmentalized approach to identify high-risk patients, particularly among 
M-CLL patients, with potential implications for stratified management."
860,"BACKGROUND: Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal 
chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a treatment option for selected patients with colorectal 
peritoneal metastases (PM). This report provides an overview of treatment and 
survival outcomes for patients deemed ineligible for CRS-HIPEC.
METHODS: Colorectal PM patients referred to a tertiary center from 2014 to 2020 
that were ineligible for CRS-HIPEC were included. Patient, tumor, and treatment 
characteristics were provided. Survival analyses were performed using the 
Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Of 476 patients referred for CRS-HIPEC, 227 (48%) were deemed 
ineligible. Median follow-up was 15 months [IQR 10-22]. Data on follow-up 
treatment was available for 198 patients, of which 73% received systemic 
therapy. These patients had a median overall survival (OS) of 17 months [IQR 
9-25]. For patients receiving best supportive care (BSC) median OS was 4 months 
[IQR 2-9]. The main reason for ineligibility was extensive PM (42%), with a 
median OS of 11 months [IQR 5-18]. Patients deemed ineligible due to (extensive) 
liver (9%) or lung metastases (8%) showed longer OS (median 22 months, IQR 8-27, 
and 24 months, IQR 12-29, respectively) than patients with extensive PM (median 
11 months, IQR 5-18) or distant lymph node metastases (median 14 months, IQR 
4-25).
CONCLUSION: The main reason for CRS-HIPEC ineligibility was extensive PM. The 
majority of patients received systemic therapy. Patients deemed ineligible due 
to extra-peritoneal metastases had better survival outcomes than patients deemed 
ineligible due to extensive PM."
861,"BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric 
junction (AEG) has been increasing since the past decade, the proportion of AEG 
cases in two previous clinical trials (ACTS-GC and CLASSIC) that investigated 
the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy was relatively small. Therefore, whether 
AEG patients can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy remains unclear.
METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with pathological stage II/III, Siewert 
II/III AEG, and underwent curative surgery at three high-volume institutions 
were assessed. Clinical outcomes were analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier curves, 
log-rank test, and Cox regression model. Propensity score matching (PSM) was 
used to reduce the selection bias.
RESULTS: A total of 927 patients were included (the chemotherapy group: 696 
patients; the surgery-only group: 231 patients). The median follow-up was 39.0 
months. The 5-year overall survival was 63.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
59.0-67.6%) for the chemotherapy group and 50.2% in the surgery-only group 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54-0.88; p = 0.003). The 5-year, 
disease-free survival was 35.4% for the chemotherapy group and 16.6% for the 
surgery-only group (HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.53-0.83; p < 0.001). After PSM, the 
survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for AEG was maintained. Multivariate 
analysis for overall survival and disease-free survival further demonstrated the 
survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy, with HRs of 0.63 (p < 0.001) and 0.52 
(p < 0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved 
overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with operable stage II or 
III AEG after D2 gastrectomy."
862,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a computed tomography 
(CT)-based radiomics nomogram for the preoperative prediction of tumor deposits 
(TDs) and clinical outcomes in patients with colon cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 383 consecutive 
patients with colon cancer from two centers. Radiomics features were extracted 
from portal venous phase CT images. Least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator regression was applied for feature selection and radiomics signature 
construction. The multivariate logistic regression model was used to establish a 
radiomics nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by using 
receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves and decision curve 
analysis. Kaplan‒Meier survival analysis was used to assess the difference of 
the overall survival (OS) in the TDs-positive and TDs-negative groups.
RESULTS: The radiomics signature was composed of 11 TDs status related features. 
The AUCs of the radiomics model in the training cohort, internal validation and 
external validation cohorts were 0.82, 0.78 and 0.78, respectively. The 
radiomics nomogram that incorporated the radiomics signature and clinical 
independent predictors (CT-N, CEA and CA199) showed good calibration and 
discrimination with AUCs of 0.88, 0.80 and 0.81 in the training cohort, internal 
validation and external validation cohorts, respectively. The radiomics 
nomogram-predicted high-risk groups had a worse OS than the low-risk groups (p < 
0.001). The radiomics nomogram-predicted TDs was an independent preoperative 
predictor of OS.
CONCLUSION: The radiomics nomogram based on CT radiomics features and clinical 
independent predictors could effectively predict the preoperative TDs status and 
OS of colon cancer.
IMPORTANT FINDINGS: CT-based radiomics nomogram may be applied in the individual 
preoperative prediction of TDs status in colon cancer. Additionally, there was a 
significant difference in OS between the high-risk and low-risk groups defined 
by the radiomics nomogram, in which patients with high-risk TDs had a 
significantly worse OS, compared with those with low-risk TDs."
863,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported on incidence and mortality patterns 
for individual genitourinary cancers in the USA. However, these studies 
addressed individual cancer types rather than genitourinary cancers overall.
OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively examine disparities and trends in the incidence 
and mortality for the four major genitourinary cancers (bladder, kidney, 
prostate, and testis) in the USA.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We obtained incidence data from the National 
Cancer Institute 22-registry Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) 
database and the US Cancer Statistics database (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention) and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics to 
examine cross-sectional and temporal trends in incidence and death rates 
stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, and county.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Age-adjusted incidence and death 
rates were calculated using SEER*Stat software. Temporal trends were analyzed 
using Joinpoint regression for a two-sided significance level of p < 0.05.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Incidence and mortality rates for bladder and kidney 
cancers were two to four times higher for men than for women. Among non-Hispanic 
White individuals, the highest incidence rates were found in the Northeast for 
bladder cancer and in Appalachia for kidney cancer, whereas the highest death 
rates for prostate cancer were found in the West. Incidence rates increased for 
cancers of the kidney and testis and for advanced-stage prostate cancer in 
almost all racial/ethnic populations and for bladder cancer in the American 
Indian/Alaska Native population. Death rates increased for testicular cancer in 
the Hispanic population and stabilized for prostate cancer among White and Asian 
American/Pacific Islander men after a steady decline since the early 1990s. 
Study limitations include misclassification of race/ethnicity on medical records 
and death certificates.
CONCLUSIONS: We found persistent sociodemographic disparities and unfavorable 
trends in incidence or mortality for all four major genitourinary cancers. 
Future studies should elucidate the reasons for these patterns.
PATIENT SUMMARY: In the USA, rates of cancer cases are increasing for kidney, 
testis, and advanced-stage prostate cancers in the overall population, and for 
bladder cancer in the American Indian/Alaska Native population. Differences in 
the rates by sex and race/ethnicity remain."
864,"Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single-gene disorders (PGT-M) is a 
procedure employed in the field of assisted reproductive technology to avoid the 
transmission of genetic diseases to the offspring. Hereditary cancer syndromes 
represent a diffuse and accepted indication for PGT-M, but take-up differs among 
the different disorders. Its use is markedly lower for the genes causing Lynch 
syndrome compared with the breast cancer type 1 or 2 susceptibility genes 
(BRCA1/2), despite the similar prevalence and severity of the two conditions. 
Reasons to explain this difference have not been explored. First, Lynch syndrome 
may be more frequently undiagnosed compared with hereditary breast and ovarian 
cancer syndrome. In addition, the different take-up may be due to different 
patient perceptions of the conditions and of the management options. Finally, 
this distinct attitude may depend on the awareness and sensibility of the 
professionals caring for affected patients. The authors' considerations are, 
however, speculative, and specific studies aimed at disentangling the causes of 
the different receptions of PGT-M are warranted to understand how to tackle this 
gap. In the meantime, we believe that empowerment regarding PGT-M of all 
individuals with hereditary cancer syndromes, including Lynch syndrome, is 
ethically due, and plead for a more active involvement of caregivers."
865,"RESEARCH QUESTION: Is there an association between post-occlusive reactive 
hyperaemia (PORH) and ovarian stimulation in women with normoandrogenaemic 
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?
DESIGN: Women eligible for IVF at an academic fertility centre were invited to 
join this prospective study. Microvascular endothelial function was measured as 
PORH by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) before and after ovarian stimulation. 
Metabolic characteristics, hormone profiles and biochemical markers were 
analysed.
RESULTS: Thirty-four normoandrogenaemic women with PCOS and 36 
normoandrogenaemic women without PCOS were included. The PCOS group displayed 
higher C-reactive protein levels and insulin resistance (P = 0.048 and 
P = 0.025, respectively). No significant difference was found in 
microcirculatory function between the groups at baseline. After ovarian 
stimulation, PORH was enhanced in the control group (slope 7.1 ± 3.3 versus 9.7 
± 4.5; P = 0.007; peak flow 30.7 ± 16.3 versus 43.5 ± 17.3, P = 0.008; however, 
the PCOS group experienced a blunting response to supraphysiological hormone 
status (slope 8.2 ± 5.1 versus 7.2 ± 4.3, P = 0.212; peak flow, 38.8 ± 19.4 
versus 37.0 ± 21.8, P = 0.895).
CONCLUSIONS: Impaired microcirculatory function could be found using a 
non-invasive LDF technique in normoandrogenaemic women with PCOS undergoing IVF, 
indicating early changes in vascular endothelial dysfunction. Future 
observational studies should clarify whether PORH measurement might help predict 
IVF prognosis or obstetric complications."
866,"BACKGROUND: RNA-based genomic risk assessment estimates chemotherapy benefit in 
patients with hormone-receptor positive (HR+)/Human Epidermal Growth Factor 
2-negative (ERBB2-) breast cancer (BC). It is virtually used in all patients 
with early HR+/ERBB2- BC regardless of clinical recurrence risk.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of adult 
patients with early-stage (T1-3; N0; M0) HR+/ERBB2- BC who underwent genomic 
testing using the Oncotype DX (Exact Sciences) 21-genes assay. Clinicopathologic 
features were collected to assess the clinical recurrence risk, in terms of 
clinical risk score (CRS) and using a composite risk score of distant recurrence 
Regan Risk Score (RRS). CRS and RRS were compared to the genomic risk of 
recurrence (GRS).
RESULTS: Between January 2015 and December 2020, 517 patients with early-stage 
disease underwent genomic testing, and clinical data was available for 501 of 
them. There was statistically significant concordance between the 3 
prognostication methods (P < 0.01). Within patients with low CRS (n = 349), 
9.17% had a high GRS, compared to 8.93% in patients with low RRS (n = 280). In 
patients with grade 1 histology (n = 130), 3.85% had a high GRS and 68.46% had 
tumors > 1 cm, of whom only 4.49% had a high GRS. Tumor size > 1cm did not 
associate with a high GRS.
CONCLUSION: Genomic testing for patients with grade 1 tumors may be safely 
omitted, irrespective of size. Our finds call for a better understanding of the 
need for routine genomic testing in patients with low grade/low clinical risk of 
recurrence."
867,"OBJECTIVES: Unmanaged pain significantly affects cancer survivors' quality of 
life. Nurses should play a significant role in pain management through 
non-pharmacological interventions. This review aims to explore the efficacy and 
safety of breathing exercises for pain management in all cancer survivors.
DESIGN: A systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: Thirteen databases, including PubMed, EMBase, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, 
CINAHL, JBI, Science Direct, Scopus, SocINDEX, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CNKI, 
and Wan Fang, were searched from inception to May, 2021.
REVIEW/ANALYSIS METHODS: Studies that focused on the efficacy of breathing 
exercises for pain management, regardless of the age of the cancer survivors, 
were included. Cochrane tools were used for the quality appraisal of the 
included studies. Because of the limited number of studies, descriptive data 
analysis was used to summarize the results.
RESULTS: Ten studies were included. Slow pursed lip breathing showed benefits 
for post-surgical pain. Contradictory findings were identified in the Enhanced 
Recovery After Surgery for post-surgical pain. Slow deep breathing and Hey-Hu 
regular breathing techniques were effective for pain management in pediatric 
cancer patients. The Active Cycle of Breathing Technique and five-minute mindful 
breathing did not have any statistically significant effects on pain relief. 
Quality of life was measured in three studies, with some improvement. Only one 
study addressed adverse events and reported that no adverse events occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Breathing exercises may be a promising approach to pain relief in 
cancer survivors. However, more rigorously designed studies are required to 
establish the evidence."
868,"INTRODUCTION: The path to approval of novel therapeutics for patients with 
BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) requires 
demonstration of efficacy in eradicating carcinoma in situ (CIS), as determined 
by cytology, white light cystoscopy and only sometimes mandatory re-biopsy. This 
paradigm is based on the premise that CIS, in contrast to papillary tumors, 
cannot be completely resected. We aimed to determine the accuracy of CIS by 
standard means and the rate at which CIS may be eradicated by transurethral 
bladder tumor resection (TURBT).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who 
underwent radical cystectomy (RC) for high risk NMIBC or muscle invasive bladder 
cancer (MIBC) between 2005 and 2019 in a tertiary academic center. The 
concordance in the presence of CIS in matched TURBT and RC samples was 
calculated.
RESULTS: Complete pathologic information was available for 816 patients with 
urothelial carcinoma. CIS was detected at TURBT in 354 (43.4%) patients (64.0% 
NMIBC, 32.3% MIBC) and at RC in 436 (53.4%) patients (64.7% NMIBC, 47.4% MIBC). 
CIS was missed by TURBT in 199 (45.6%) of those cases (NMIBC 25.4%, MIBC 60.6%). 
CIS detected on TURBT was not found in the RC specimen in 33.1% (117/354) of 
cases. Lack of prospective bladder mapping and central pathology review are 
limitations.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that TURBT is inaccurate in detecting CIS. The 
absence of CIS in the RC specimen after detection in the matched TURBT specimen 
suggests that CIS may be completely resected by TURBT in a proportion of 
patients. These factors need to be considered in the design of clinical trials 
in patients with NMIBC. The use of random biopsies or enhanced cystoscopy could 
improve the accuracy of CIS detection, but the former is associated with patient 
morbidity and randomization would alleviate concern about these variables 
impacting clinical trial outcomes."
869,"BACKGROUND: Active surveillance (AS) is recommended as the preferred treatment 
for men with low-risk disease. In order to optimize risk stratification and 
exclude undiagnosed higher-grade disease, most AS protocols recommend a 
confirmatory biopsy.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare outcomes among men with grade group (GG) 2/3 
prostate cancer on initial biopsy with those among men whose disease was 
initially GG1 but was upgraded to GG2/3 on confirmatory biopsy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed patients undergoing radical 
prostatectomy (RP) in two cohorts: ""immediate RP group,"" with GG2/3 cancer on 
diagnostic biopsy, and ""AS group,"" with GG1 cancer on initial biopsy that was 
upgraded to GG2/3 on confirmatory biopsy.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Probabilities of biochemical 
recurrence (BCR) and salvage therapy were determined using multivariable Cox 
regression models with risk adjustment. Risks of adverse pathology at RP were 
also compared using logistic regression.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The immediate RP group comprised 4009 patients and the 
AS group comprised 321 patients. The AS group had lower adjusted rates of 
adverse pathology (27% vs 35%, p = 0.003). BCR rates were lower in the AS group, 
although this did not reach conventional significance (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-1.06, p = 0.10) compared with the immediate RP 
group. Risk-adjusted 1- and 5-yr BCR rates were 4.6% (95% CI 3.0-6.5%) and 10.4% 
(95% CI 6.9-14%), respectively, for the AS group compared with 6.3% (95% CI 
5.6-7.0%) and 20% (95% CI 19-22%), respectively, in the immediate RP group. A 
nonsignificant association was observed for salvage treatment-free survival 
favoring the AS group (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42, 1.06, p = 0.087).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that men with GG1 cancer who were upgraded on confirmatory 
biopsy tend to have less aggressive disease than men with the same grade found 
at initial biopsy. These results must be confirmed in larger series before 
recommendations can be made regarding a more conservative approach in men with 
upgraded pathology on surveillance biopsy.
PATIENT SUMMARY: We studied men with low-risk prostate cancer who were initially 
eligible for active surveillance but presented with more aggressive cancer on 
confirmatory biopsy. We found that outcomes for these men were better than the 
outcomes for those diagnosed initially with more serious cancer."
870,"BACKGROUND: While microbiome and host regulation contribute independently to 
many disease states, it is unclear how circumcision in pediatric population 
influences subsequent changes in penile microbiome.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to analyze jointly paired taxonomic profiles and 
assess pathways implicated in inflammation, barrier protection, and energy 
metabolism.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed 11 paired samples, periurethral 
collection, before and after circumcision, to generate microbiome and mycobiome 
profiling. Sample preparation of 16S ribosomal RNA and internal transcribed 
spacer sequencing was adapted from the methods developed by the National 
Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We obtained the predictive 
functional attributes of the microbial communities between samples using 
Silva-Tax4Fun and the Greengenes-Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by 
Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) approach. The predictive 
functioning of the microbial communities was determined by linearly combining 
the normalized taxonomic abundances into the precomputed association matrix of 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthology reference profiles.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Several notable microbiome and mycobiome compositional 
differences were observed between pre- and postcircumcision patients. Pairwise 
comparisons across taxa revealed a significant decrease (p < 0.05, false 
discovery rate corrected) of microbiome organisms (Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, 
and Campylobacterales) and mycobiome (Saccharomycetales and Pleosporales) 
following circumcision. A total of 14 pathways were found to differ in abundance 
between the pre- and postcircumcision groups (p < 0.005, false discovery rate 
<0.1 and linear discriminant analysis score >3; five enriched and nine 
depleted). The pathways reduced after circumcision were mostly involved with 
amino acid and glucose metabolism, while pathways prior to circumcision were 
enriched in genetic information processing and transcription processes. As 
expected, enrichment in methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein, an integral 
membrane protein involved in directed motility of microbes to chemical cues and 
environment, occurred prior to circumcision, while the filamentous hemagglutinin 
pathway (a strong immunogenic protein) was depleted after circumcision 
CONCLUSIONS: Our results offer greater insight into the host-microbiota 
relationship of penile circumcision and may serve to lay the groundwork for 
future studies focused on drivers of inflammation, infection, and oncogenesis.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Our study showed a significant reduction in bacteria and fungi 
after circumcision, particularly anaerobic bacteria, which are known to be 
potential inducers of inflammation and cancer. This is the first study of its 
kind showing the changes in microbiome after circumcision, and some of the 
changes that occur in healthy infants after circumcision that may explain the 
differences in cancer and inflammatory disorders in adulthood."
871,"Natural killer (NK) cell therapies show potential for tumor treatment but were 
immunologically resisted by the overexpressed immunosuppressing 
tumor-cell-surface glycans. To reverse this glycan-mediated immunosuppression, 
the surface NK-inhibitory glycan expressions need to be downregulated and 
NK-activating glycan levels should be elevated synchronously with optimal 
efficiency. Here, we design a core-shell membrane-fusogenic liposome (MFL) to 
simultaneously achieve the physical modification of NK-activating glycans and 
biological inhibition of immunosuppressing glycans on the tumor cell surface via 
a membrane-fusion manner. Loaded into a 
tumor-microenvironment-triggered-degradable thermosensitive hydrogel, MFLs could 
be conveniently injected and controllably released into local tumor. Through 
fusion with tumor cell membrane, the released MFLs could simultaneously deliver 
sialyltransferase-inhibitor-loaded core into cytoplasm, and anchor 
NK-activating-glycan-modified shell onto tumor surface. This 
spatially-differential distribution of core and shell in one cell ensures the 
effective inhibition of intracellular sialyltransferase to downregulate 
immunosuppressing sialic acid, and direct presentation of NK-activating Lewis X 
trisaccharide (LeX) on tumor surface simultaneously. Consequentially, the sialic 
acid-caused immunosuppression of tumor surface was reprogrammed to be 
LeX-induced NK activation, resulting in sensitive susceptibility to 
NK-cell-mediated recognition and lysis for improved tumor elimination. This MFL 
provides a novel platform for multiplex cell engineering and personalized

872,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for cancer recurrence, treatment 
failure and metastatic dissemination. As such, the elimination of CSCs 
represents one of the most important approaches for the future of cancer 
treatment. Among other properties, CSCs show the activation of particular cell 
signalling pathways and the over-expression of certain transcription factors, 
such as SOX2. Herein, we describe a new model system to isolate stem-like cancer 
cells, based on the functional transcriptional activity of SOX2. Briefly, we 
employed a SOX2-enhancer-GFP-reporter system to isolate cancer cells with high 
SOX2 transcriptional activity by FACS sorting. The over-expression of SOX2 in 
this sub-population was validated by Western blot analysis and flow cytometry. 
SOX2-high cancer cells showed CSCs features, such as greater mammosphere forming 
ability, validating that this sub-population was enriched in CSCs. To further 
explore the model, we analysed other stemness characteristics in MCF7 and 
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, corroborating that SOX2-high cells were 
more metabolically active, proliferative, migratory, invasive, and 
drug-resistant. SOX2-high MDA-MB-231 cells also showed a loss of E-cadherin 
expression, and increased Vimentin expression, consistent with an 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Therefore, endogenous SOX2 
transcriptional activity and protein levels are mechanistically linked to 
aggressive phenotypic behaviours and energy production in CSCs."
873,"BACKGROUND: Bladder carcinoma (BC) represents one of the most prevalent 
malignant cancers, while predicting its clinical outcomes using traditional 
indicators is difficult. This study aimed to develop a miRNA signature for the 
prognostic prediction of patients with BC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MiRNAs that expressed differentially were identified 
between 413 BC and 19 non-tumor patients, whose prognostic values were evaluated 
using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The independent 
prognostic factors were screened out and were used to establish a signature. The 
risk score of the signature was calculated. Receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to verify the predictive 
performance of the miRNA signature and the risk score. A nomogram was 
constructed which integrated with the miRNA signature and clinical parameters. 
Experiments were performed.
RESULTS: 7 prognosis related miRNAs were selected as independent risk factors, 
and a 7-miRNA signature was constructed, with an area under ROC (AUC) of 0.721. 
The 7-miRNA-signature based risk score acts as an independent prognostic factor, 
with satisfactory predictive performance (AUC = 0.744). Increased miR-337-3p 
expressions were detected in tumor samples and BC cell lines than in 
non-tumorigenic tissues and cell lines. Experiments suggested that miR-337-3p 
induces the proliferation, migration, and invasion of BC cells.
CONCLUSION: The constructed 7-miRNA signature is a promising biomarker for 
predicting the prognosis of patients with BC, and miR-337-3p may act as a 
candidate therapeutic target in BC treatments."
874,"Prostate cancer is the most prevalent genitourinary malignant cancer in men 
worldwide. Patients with prostate cancer who progress to castration-resistant 
prostate cancer (CRPC) or metastatic CRPC have significantly poorer survival. 
Advanced prostate cancer is a clinical challenge due to the lack of effective 
treatment strategies. In the field of oncology, SGOL2 was an emerging and 
differentially expressed molecule, which enhanced the proliferation of cell 
populations in vitro in our studies. Mass spectrum and Co-IP validated the 
interaction of SGOL2 and RAB1A in a protein-protein manner. We further 
investigated the role of SGOL2 in the regulatory mechanism of RAB1A in prostate 
cancer cell lines. Furthermore, SGOL2 regulated RAB1A expression by inhibiting 
its ubiquitination. Rescue Experiments demonstrated that SGOL2 promoted prostate 
cancer cell proliferation and migration by upregulating RAB1A expression. 
Finally, we found that SGOL2 and RAB1A may regulate the tumor microenvironment 
(TME) in prostate cancer. In conclusion, our findings concluded that SGOL2 
stabilized RAB1A expression to promote prostate cancer development. Both of them 
were of great importance in TME modulation."
875,"The positive and pro-economic trend in the management of cancer treatment is the 
search for the antineoplastic potential of known, widely used and safe drugs 
with a different clinical purpose. A good candidate seems to be moxifloxacin 
with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, which as the member of the fourth 
generation fluoroquinolone is known to affect not only bacterial but also 
eukaryotic DNA topoisomerases, however at high concentration. Due to the fact 
that the modification of parent drug with lipid component can improve anticancer 
potential by increasing of bioavailability, selectivity, and cytotoxic 
efficiency, we evaluated the mechanisms of cytotoxic activity of novel 
moxifloxacin conjugates with fatty acids and verified metabolic profile in 
SW480, SW620 and PC3 cell lines. Our study revealed that cytotoxic potential of 
moxifloxacin conjugates was stronger than free moxifloxacin, moreover, they 
remained non-toxic to normal HaCaT cells. PC3 were more sensitive to MXF 
conjugates than colon cancer cells. The most promising cytotoxic activity 
exhibited conjugate 4m and 16m with oleic and stearic acid reducing viability of 
PC3 and SW620 cells. Tested conjugates activated caspases 3/7 and induced 
late-apoptosis, mainly in PC3 and SW620 cells. However, the most pronounced 
inhibition of NF-κB activation and IL-6 secretion was observed in SW480. 
Metabolomic analysis indicated influence of the moxifloxacin conjugates on 
intensity of lipid derivatives with the most successful metabolite profile in 
PC3. Our findings suggested the cytotoxic potential of moxifloxacin conjugates, 
especially with oleic and stearic acid can be beneficial in oncological therapy, 
including their possible anti-inflammatory and known antibacterial effect."
876,"INTRODUCTION: Complex polyps require the use of advanced endoscopic techniques 
or minimally invasive surgery for their approach. In rectal polyps it is of 
special relevance to reach a consensus on the best approach to avoid under- or 
overtreatment that increases unnecessary morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: We describe a prospective, multicenter, pilot clinical trial with a 
first-in-human medical device. It is hypothesized that UNI-VEC® facilitates 
transanal laparoendoscopic surgery for the removal of early rectal tumors. The 
primary objective is to evaluate that it is safe and meets the established 
functional requirements. Secondary objectives are to evaluate results, 
complications and level of satisfaction.
RESULTS: 16 patients were recruited in 12 months with a minimum follow-up of 2 
months. The mean size was 3.4 cm with the largest polyp being 6 cm. Regarding 
location, the mean was 6.6 cm from the anal margin. Endoscopic Mucosal Resection 
(EMR) (6.3%), Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection ESD (43.8%), REC (6.3%) and TAMIS 
(43.8%) were performed. The mean time was 73.25 min. The 56.3% used a 30° camera 
and 43.8% used the flexible endoscope as a viewing instrument. The 56.3% were 
benign lesions and 43.8% malignant. Complete resection is achieved in 87.5%. 
Regarding complications, mild bleeding (Clavien I) occurred in 25%, 6.3% and 
21.4% at 24 h, 48 h and 7 days respectively. Continence was assessed according 
to the Wexner scale. At 7 days, 60% showed perfect continence, 26.7% mild FI and 
13.3% moderate FI. At 30 days, 66.7% had perfect continence, 20% mild FI and 
13.3% moderate FI. At 2 months, 4 patients were reviewed who at 30 days had a 
Wexner's degree higher than preoperative and perfect continence was demonstrated 
in 25% of the patients, 50% mild and 25% moderate. In no case did rectal 
perforation or major complications requiring urgent reintervention occur. As for 
the level of reproducibility, safety, level of satisfaction with the device and 
evaluation of the blister, the evaluation on a scale of 0 to 10 (9.43, 9.71, 
9.29 and 9.50 respectively). All the investigators have previous experience with 
transanal devices.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of UNI-VEC® for the 
treatment of rectal lesions. It will facilitate the implementation of hybrid 
procedures that seek to solve the limitations of pure endoscopic techniques by 
allowing the concomitant use of conventional laparoscopic and robotic 
instrumentation with the flexible endoscope."
877,"The use of standard next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to detect key 
mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes for glioma diagnosis imposes 
several challenges including high capital cost and turnaround delays associated 
with the need for batch testing. Both for glioma testing, as well as for testing 
in other tumor types where highly specific mutation identification is required, 
the high throughput nature of NGS limits the feasibility of using it as a 
primary approach in clinical laboratories. We hypothesized that third generation 
nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has the capability to 
overcome these limitations. This study aimed to develop and validate a 
nanopore-based IDH mutation detection assay for clinical practice using glioma 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Glioma FFPE (n=66) samples with 
confirmed IDH gene mutational status were sequenced on ONT's MinION device using 
an amplicon-based approach. All cases were concordant when compared to the 
reference results. Limit of blank and limit of detection for the variant allele 
fraction were 1.5% and 3.3% respectively at 500x read depth per gene. Total 
sequencing cost per sample was $50-$134 CAD with results being available in 9-15 
hours. These findings demonstrate that nanopore-sequencing technology can be 
leveraged to develop low cost, high performance clinical sequencing-based assays 
with quick turn-around times, to support the detection of targeted mutations in 
FFPE tumor tissue."
878,"Enormous recent progress in diagnostic testing can enable more accurate 
diagnosis and improved clinical outcomes. Yet, these tests are increasingly 
challenging and frustrating; the volume and diversity of results may overwhelm 
the diagnostic acumen of even the most dedicated and experienced clinician. 
Because they are gathered and processed within the 'silos' of each diagnostic 
discipline, diagnostic data are fragmented, and the EHR does little to 
synthesize new and existing data into usable information. Therefore, despite 
great promise, diagnoses may still be incorrect, delayed, or never made. 
Integrative Diagnostics represents a vision for the future, wherein diagnostic 
data, together with clinical data from the EHR, are aggregated and 
contextualized by informatics tools to direct clinical action. Integrative 
Diagnostics has the potential to identify correct therapies more quickly, modify 
treatment when appropriate, and terminate treatment when not efficacious; 
ultimately decreasing morbidity, improving outcomes, and avoiding unnecessary 
costs. Radiology, laboratory medicine, and pathology already play major roles in 
medical diagnostics. Our specialties can increase the value of our examinations 
by taking a holistic approach to their selection, interpretation, and 
application to the patient's care pathway. We have the means and rationale to 
incorporate Integrative Diagnostics into our specialties and guide its 
implementation in clinical practice."
879,"High expression of the transmembrane receptor IL6ST (gp130) has been identified 
as a predictive biomarker of endocrine treatment response in ERα-positive breast 
cancers. To investigate its function further in this disease, this study 
evaluated the expression, function and signalling of IL6ST in ERα-positive 
breast cancer cell lines and investigated crosstalk between ERα and IL6ST. IL6ST 
was differentially expressed in ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines (low in 
MCF-7, high in ZR751 and T47D), while multiple soluble isoforms of IL6ST were 
identified. IL6ST is the common signal transducing receptor component for the 
IL6ST family of cytokines and the effects of seven IL6ST cytokines on these cell 
lines were studied. These cytokines caused differential growth and migration 
effects in these cell lines e.g. MCF-7 cells were growth-stimulated, while ZR751 
cells were inhibited by IL6 and OSM.. Activation of the STAT and ERK pathways is 
associated with these responses. Evidence to support trans-signalling involved 
in cell growth and migration was obtained in both MCF-7 and ZR751 models. 
Interaction between cytokines and estrogen on ERα-positive cell lines growth 
were analysed. High expression of IL6ST (in ZR751) may lead to growth inhibition 
by interacting cytokines while lower expression (in MCF-7) appears associated 
with proliferation. High IL6ST expression is consistent with a more beneficial 
clinical outcome if cytokine action contributes to anti-estrogen action."
880,"Viruses are important components of the human body. Growing evidence suggests 
that they are engaged in the physiology and disease status of the host. Even 
though the vaginal microbiome is involved in human papillomavirus (HPV) 
infection and cervical cancer (CC) progression, little is known about the role 
of the vaginal virome. In this pilot exploratory study, using unbiased viral 
metagenomics, we aim to investigate the vaginal eukaryotic virome in women with 
different levels of cervical lesions, and examine their associations with 
different cervical disease status. An altered eukaryotic virome was observed in 
women with different levels of lesions and Lactobacillus profiles. Anelloviruses 
and papillomaviruses are the most commonly detected eukaryotic viruses of the 
vaginal virome. Higher abundance and richness of anelloviruses and 
papillomaviruses were associated with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion 
(LSIL) and CC. Besides, higher anellovirus abundance was also associated with 
lactobacillus-depleted microbiome profiles and bacterial community state (CST) 
type IV. Furthermore, increased correlations between Anelloviridae and 
Papillomaviridae occurred in the women with increased cervical disease severity 
level from LSIL to CC. These data suggest underlying interactions between 
different microbes as well as the host physiology. Higher abundance and 
diversity of both anelloviruses and papillomaviruses shared by LSIL and CC 
suggest that anellovirus may be used as a potential adjunct biomarker to predict 
the risk of HPV persistent infection and/or CC. Future studies need to focus on 
the clinical relevance of anellovirus abundance with cervical disease status, 
and the evaluation of their potential as a new adjunct biomarker for the 
prediction and prognoses of CC."
881,"Proton beam therapy (PBT) is utilized worldwide in the treatment of pediatric 
cancers and many cancers in adults as accumulating clinical evidence indicates 
dosimetric and toxicity advantages. However, Canada is the only G8 country 
without an operating clinical PBT facility. Access to out-of-country PBT 
referrals, adjudicated by individual provincial governments, varies across the 
country. The lack of domestic capacity for PBT, variability in public funding 
nationwide, and the anticipated future demand for PBT suggest unmet needs for 
health equity in Canadian cancer care. This article outlines the current state 
of access to PBT across Canadian provinces, domains of health inequities among 
those receiving PBT, and strategies for addressing health inequity in PBT, in 
the context of ongoing planning for a Canadian publicly funded facility. The 
lessons learned from the Canadian experience may be applicable to other 
jurisdictions seeking to improve fair, equitable access to PBT."
882,"BACKGROUND: The prespecified on-treatment analysis of ASCEND-ND (NCT02876835) 
raised concerns about a higher relative risk of cancer-related adverse events 
(AEs) with daprodustat vs darbepoetin in patients with anaemia of CKD. This 
concern was not observed in dialysis patients in ASCEND-D (NCT02879305).
METHODS: ASCEND-ND randomized 3 872 patients to daprodustat or darbepoetin. 
ASCEND-D randomized 2 964 patients to daprodustat or conventional ESAs. In both 
studies ESA comparators used different dosing intervals (3/week, 1/week, every 2 
or every 4 weeks). The prespecified on-treatment approach examined relative 
risks for cancer AEs up to the last dose date (LDD) +1 day. In these analyses, 
owing to different dosing intervals between arms, Cox models were used to 
estimate the daprodustat effect by various follow-up periods (censoring at LDD, 
LDD + dosing intervals, or end of study).
RESULTS: In ASCEND-ND, the safety of daprodustat vs. darbepoetin on 
cancer-related AEs depended on the duration of follow-up after LDD: hazard ratio 
(HR) 1.04 (95%CI 0.77, 1.40) at end of study; HR 1.12 (95%CI 0.81, 1.56) for 
LDD + dosing interval; HR 1.50 (95%CI 1.04, 2.15) for LDD + 1 day. In ASCEND-D, 
no excess risk of cancer-related AEs was observed with any model examined.
CONCLUSIONS: Prespecified on-treatment analyses for cancer-related AEs appeared 
to result in biased risk estimates in ASCEND-ND by preferentially under-counting 
events from patients assigned to darbepoetin. Analyses accounting for longer 
darbepoetin dosing intervals, or extending follow-up, resulted in attenuation of 
effect estimates towards neutrality, similar to ASCEND-D, where ESA comparator 
dosing intervals are closer to daprodustat."
883,"The tumor-suppressive activity of p53 is largely attributed to its ability to 
induce cell death, including apoptosis through transcription-dependent and 
-independent mechanisms. On the one hand, nuclear p53 transcriptionally 
activates the expression of a myriad of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family genes, such 
as NOXA, PUMA, BID, BAD, BIK, BAX, etc., whereas inactivates the expression of 
anti-apoptotic BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL1, leading to mitochondrial apoptosis. On 
the other hand, cytoplasmic p53 also promotes mitochondrial apoptosis by 
directly associating with multiple BCL-2 family proteins in the mitochondria. 
Apoptosis-related protein in TGF-β signaling pathway (ARTS), a 
mitochondria-localized pro-apoptotic protein encoded by an alternative spliced 
variant of the SEPT4 gene, triggers apoptosis by facilitating proteasomal 
degradation of BCL-2 and XIAP upon pro-apoptotic stimuli. We recently identified 
SEPT4/ARTS as a new p53 target gene in response to genotoxic stress. ARTS in 
turn binds to p53, drives its mitochondrial localization, and enhances the 
interaction between p53 and BCL-XL, thereby promoting mitochondrial apoptosis. 
This review will illustrate the mechanisms of p53-induced mitochondrial 
apoptosis, offer some recently discovered new insights into the ARTS functions 
in regulating mitochondrial cell death, and discuss the clinical significance of 
ARTS in cancer and non-cancer diseases."
884,"INTRODUCTION: Intra-arterial hepatic (IAH) treatment has shown promising results 
in the management of patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases 
(CRLM) the prognosis of which is poor. Bevacizumab adjunction to standard 
chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival of this patient population. This 
prospective study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of IAH 
bevacizumab combined to systemic chemotherapy after first-line treatment failure 
in patients with CRLM.
METHODS: Included patients had dominant or isolated unresectable CRLM 
progressing after standard first-line treatment for metastases of colorectal 
cancer. Three patients had less than 30% liver invasion, three patients between 
30 and 50%, two more than 50% and data was missing in two patients. An 
intra-hepatic catheter was implanted surgically or percutaneously. Bevacizumab 
7.5 mg/kg was administered once every 3 weeks in combination with capecitabine 
2000 mg/m² per day for 2 weeks and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² or irinotecan 200 mg/m² 
once every 3 weeks. The primary end-point was the objective response rate.
RESULTS: Between June 2013 and February 2015, 10 patients were included. The 
trial was prematurely closed because of the lack of financial support and poor 
accrual. The patients had a median of 6 [1-9] cycles of treatment. Partial 
response was achieved in 2 patients (20%) and a R0 liver metastases resection in 
one another. All patients died of disease progression. The median overall and 
progression-free survival rates were respectively 14.0 (95% IC [4.8 - 25.8] and 
5.4 months (95% IC [1.6 - 6.2]). Four patients had severe side effects but no 
toxic death occurred.
CONCLUSION: IAH bevacizumab combined to systemic chemotherapy is feasible and 
safe in patients with unresectable isolated or dominant CRLM progressing after a 
first-line systemic treatment. Based on the low number of patients included in 
our study, our results suggest that this treatment does not increase 
dramatically the response rate versus an adapted systemic treatment. However, 
considering the safety data provided in this study, arterial infusion of 
bevacizumab in adjunction to chemotherapeutic agents could be evaluated in the 
future."
885,"Currently, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are the most produced nanoparticles in 
global market and have been widely utilized in the biomedical field. Here, we 
investigated the morphological and mechanical effects of AgNPs on cancerous 
cells of A549 cells and SMMC-7721 cells with atomic force microscope (AFM). The 
influences of AgNPs on the morphological properties and mechanical properties of 
cancerous cells were characterized utilizing the force-volume (FV) mode and 
force spectroscopy (FS) mode of AFM measurement. We mainly focus on the 
comparison of the effects of AgNPs on the two types of cancerous cells based on 
the fitting results of calculating the Young's moduli based on Sneddon model. 
The results showed that the morphology changed little but the mechanical 
properties of height, roughness, adhesion force and Young's moduli of two 
cancerous cells varied significantly with the stimulation of different 
concentrations of AgNPs. This research has provide insights into the 
classification and characterization of the effects of the various concentrations 
of AgNPs on the cancerous cells in vitro by utilizing AFM methodologies for 
disease therapy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
886,"INTRODUCTION: A core element of a radiographer's role is the decision on whether 
a radiograph is sufficient for diagnosis, or a repeat examination is needed. 
Studies illustrate the disagreement on the diagnostic value of radiographs 
between radiographers and radiologists, which may influence repeat examinations. 
This study investigates if parameters contributing to image quality are possible 
determinants to explain the difference between professions.
METHODS: A total of 74 radiographers and radiologists from three different 
countries assessed three data sets (chest PA, hip HBL, c-spine lateral), each 
containing 25 radiographs. All observers scored image quality in terms of 
anatomical visualisation, positioning, collimation, detector exposure and judged 
the diagnostic value using the ACR RadLex classification. All assessments were 
performed on a clinically relevant display. Visual grading characteristics were 
used to compare image quality evaluations between groups.
RESULTS: Radiographers scored the visualisation of anatomical structures lower 
than radiologists though the difference was not statistically significant. A 
difference in classification using the RadLex categories - with radiographers 
rejecting more radiographs - was demonstrated. Only the subjective evaluation of 
the detector exposure correlated statistically with RadLex ratings. There was no 
difference between radiographers and radiologists when reviewing patient 
positioning and collimation.
CONCLUSION: Radiographers and radiologists agree on the visualisation of 
anatomical structures, but radiographers are more critical towards the 
diagnostic value. Within the criteria studied, the evaluation of anatomical 
structures does not explain the difference. Radiographs have a higher change of 
being rejected if the observer (subjectively) assessed the detector exposure as 
inappropriate. This correlation is stronger for radiographers."
887,"Aging causes loss of brain synapses and memory, and microglial phagocytosis of 
synapses may contribute to this loss. Stressed neurons can release the 
nucleotide UTP, which is rapidly converted into UDP, that in turn activates the 
P2Y6 receptor (P2Y6 R) on the surface of microglia, inducing microglial 
phagocytosis of neurons. However, whether the activation of P2Y6 R affects 
microglial phagocytosis of synapses is unknown. We show here that inactivation 
of P2Y6 R decreases microglial phagocytosis of isolated synapses (synaptosomes) 
and synaptic loss in neuronal-glial co-cultures. In vivo, wild-type mice aged 
from 4 to 17 months exhibited reduced synaptic density in cortical and 
hippocampal regions, which correlated with increased internalization of synaptic 
material within microglia. However, this aging-induced synaptic loss and 
internalization were absent in P2Y6 R knockout mice, and these mice also lacked 
any aging-induced memory loss. Thus, P2Y6 R appears to mediate aging-induced 
loss of synapses and memory by increasing microglial phagocytosis of synapses. 
Consequently, blocking P2Y6 R has the potential to prevent age-associated memory 
impairment."
888,"Radiotherapy is one of the most common modalities for the treatment of a wide 
range of tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC); however, radioresistance of 
cancer cells remains a major limitation for this treatment. Following 
radiotherapy, the activities of various cellular mechanisms and cell signaling 
pathways are altered, resulting in the development of radioresistance, which 
leads to therapeutic failure and poor prognosis in patients with cancer. 
Furthermore, even though several inhibitors have been developed to target tumor 
resistance, these molecules can induce side effects in nontumor cells due to low 
specificity and efficiency. However, the role of these mechanisms in CRC has not 
been extensively studied. This review discusses recent studies regarding the 
relationship between radioresistance and the alterations in a series of cellular 
mechanisms and cell signaling pathways that lead to therapeutic failure and 
tumor recurrence. Our review also presents recent advances in the in vitro/in 
vivo study models aimed at investigating the radioresistance mechanism in CRC. 
Furthermore, it provides a relevant biochemical basis in theory, which can be 
useful to improve radiotherapy sensitivity and prolong patient survival."
889,"Many disorders of iron homeostasis (e.g., iron overload) are associated with 
dynamic kinetic profiles of multiple non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) species, 
chronic exposure to which is associated with deleterious end-organ effects. Here 
we discuss the chemical nature of NTBI species, challenges with measuring NTBI 
in plasma and the clinical relevance of NTBI exposure based on source (iron 
overload disorder vs. intravenous iron-carbohydrate complex administration). 
NTBI is not a single entity but consists of multiple, often poorly characterized 
species, some of which are kinetically non-exchangeable while others are 
relatively exchangeable. Prolonged presence of plasma NTBI is associated with 
excessive tissue iron accumulation in susceptible tissues with consequences such 
as endocrinopathy and heart failure. By contrast, intravenous iron-carbohydrate 
nanomedicines administration leads only to transient NTBI appearance and lacks 
evidence for association with adverse clinical outcomes. Assays to measure 
plasma NTBI are typically technically complex and remain chiefly a research 
tool. There have been two general approaches to estimating NTBI: capture assays 
and redox-activity assays. Early assays could not avoid capturing some iron from 
transferrin thus overestimating NTBI. By contrast some later assays may have 
promoted the donation of NTBI species to transferrin during the assay procedure, 
potentially underestimating NTBI levels. The levels of transferrin saturation at 
which NTBI species have been detectable have varied between different 
methodologies and between patient populations studied. This article is protected

890,"Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and 
specifically in deep learning (DL) techniques, have enabled broad application of 
these methods in health care. The promise of the DL approach has spurred further 
interest in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) development and applications using 
both 'traditional' machine learning methods and newer DL-based methods. We use 
the term CAD-AI to refer to this expanded clinical decision support environment 
that uses traditional and DL-based AI methods. Numerous studies have been 
published to date on the development of machine learning tools for 
computer-aided, or AI-assisted, clinical tasks. However, most of these machine 
learning models are not ready for clinical deployment. It is of paramount 
importance to ensure that a clinical decision support tool undergoes proper 
training and rigorous validation of its generalizability and robustness before 
adoption for patient care in the clinic. To address these important issues, the 
American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Computer-Aided Image 
Analysis Subcommittee (CADSC) is charged, in part, to develop recommendations on 
practices and standards for the development and performance assessment of 
computer-aided decision support systems. The committee has previously published 
two opinion papers on the evaluation of CAD systems and issues associated with 
user training and quality assurance of these systems in the clinic. With machine 
learning techniques continuing to evolve and CAD applications expanding to new 
stages of the patient care process, the current task group report considers the 
broader issues common to the development of most, if not all, CAD-AI 
applications and their translation from the bench to the clinic. The goal is to 
bring attention to the proper training and validation of machine learning 
algorithms that may improve their generalizability and reliability and 
accelerate the adoption of CAD-AI systems for clinical decision support. This

891,"BACKGROUND: Incidental gastrointestinal tract (GIT) uptake is found in up to 
6.3% of patients undergoing positron emission tomography (PET). This may be 
physiologic or pathologic and requires endoscopic assessment.
AIM: To determine the diagnostic yield of endoscopy in this setting and 
characterise PET avidity as a predictor of clinically significant findings.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients undergoing upper 
endoscopy or colonoscopy for incidental 18 FDG PET positivity in the GIT.
RESULTS: A total of 255 patients (62% male, median age 67 years) underwent 
colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy for 276 separate areas of PET avidity in the colon. 
Malignancy was found in 44 cases (16%), while a significant polyp was found in 
an additional 103 cases (37%). Neoplastic change was found more often in case of 
intense compared with non-intense PET avidity (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.95-5.93, 
p<0.001), and in focal compared with diffuse uptake (OR 5.97, 95% CI 2.9-12.2, 
p<0.001). Upper GIT endoscopy was performed in 75 patients (46 male, median age 
63 years) for 77 isolated areas with PET avidity. Malignancy was found in 16 
cases (21%), and all were new primary lesions. Numerically, malignant findings 
were more common in intense (29.7%) than non-intense (12.5%) PET avidity (OR 
2.96, 95%, CI 0.92-9.57, p=0.069).
CONCLUSIONS: Both focal and intense colonic 18 FDG uptake correlate strongly 
with a high-risk polyp or malignant lesion. Up to 21% of all gastroscopies 
performed for evaluation of incidental PET uptake diagnosed a new primary 
malignancy. These referrals need appropriate triaging and timely endoscopic 
assessment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

adverse events. Head and neck surgeons are faced with significant challenges to 
minimize associated morbidity and manage its sequelae. Recognizing situations in 
which a surgical complication is an adverse event inherent to the procedure can 
alleviate the psychologic impact a complication might have on the treatment team 
and minimize external and internal pressures. Focusing on the complications that 
can be effectively modified, future complications can be avoided. Also, some 
surgical morbidities may not be preventable, necessitating the option to 
reconsider whether the incidents should be labeled toxic reactions rather than a 
complication. This discussion highlights some of the areas in which additional 
research is needed to achieve the goal of minimizing the impact of surgical 
morbidity."
893,"BACKGROUND: Increased Ca2+ entry causes an increase in tumor cell proliferation, 
apoptosis, cytosolic reactive free oxygen species (cyROS), and mitochondrial ROS 
(miROS) in tumor cells. The cyROS and miROS stimulate the cation channels, 
including the TRPA1, TRPM2, and TRPV1. Sambucus ebulus L (SEB) (Dwarf Elder) 
induced both antioxidant and anticancer effects in the human hepatocarcinoma and 
human colon carcinoma cancer cell lines. We investigated the etiology of 
colorectal cancer and the impact of three channels, as well as the protective 
effects of SEB on apoptosis, cyROS, and miROS in the colon of mice with 
colitis-associated colon cancer (AOM/DSS).
METHODS: A total 28 mice were equally divided into four groups as control, SEB 
(100 mg/kg/day for 14 days), AOM/DSS, and SEB + AOM/DSS. Azoxymethane/dextran 
sulfate sodium-induced colon cancer associated with colitis was induced in the 
AOM/DSS groups within 10 weeks. At the end of the experiments, the colon samples 
were removed from the mice.
RESULTS: The protein bands of caspase - 3, TRPA1, TRPM2, and TRPV1 were 
increased by the treatments of AOM/DSS. The levels of apoptosis, cyROS, cleaved 
caspase - 3, and cleaved caspase - 9, as well as the depolarization of the 
mitochondrial membrane, all increased in the AOM/DSS group. Although they were 
reduced in the SEB and AOM/DSS + SEB groups by the treatments of SEB, TRPA1 
(AP18), TRPM2 (ACA), and TRPV1 (capsazepine) antagonists, the apoptotic and 
oxidant values were further elevated in the AOM/DSS group by the treatments of 
TRPA1 (cinnamaldehyde), TRPM2 (H2O2), and TRPV1 (capsaicin) agonists.
CONCLUSION: The activations of TRPA1, TRPM2, and TRPV1 channels induced the 
increase of apoptotic and oxidant actions in the colon cancer cells, although 
their inhibition via SEB treatment decreased the actions. Hence, TRPA1, TRPM2, 
and TRPV1 activations could be used as effective agents in the treatment of 
colon tumors."
894,"In this study, we have investigated the chemotherapeutic potential of titanium 
dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles on skin and breast cancer cells. The cells have 
treated with a 75 µg/ml concentration of titanium dioxide because it is a 
recommended dose with proven effectiveness in vitro studies and then the cells 
were exposed to UV-A radiation. The combined effects of titanium dioxide and 
UV-A radiation on cell viability, cell cycle, plasma membrane, mitochondrial 
membrane potentials and apoptotic activity of the cells were investigated. The 
viability of SK-MEL 30 cells was measured by MTT assay and apoptotic activity of 
cells was determined by Annexin-V FITC/PI staining. As a result of the research, 
an increase was observed in the viability of cells treated with 75 µg/ml 
titanium dioxide concentration, while a significant decrease in cell viability 
was observed for both cell types when UV-A radiation and TiO2 were applied 
together. The results also showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells 
increased as a result of UV + TiO2 exposure. Accordingly, it can be said that 
TiO2 nanoparticles may research as potential chemotherapeutic agents for skin 
and breast cancers, especially in the presence of UV radiation."
895,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication therapy is an efficient primary 
prevention method to reduce gastric cancer development. In Japan, biennial 
endoscopic screening for individuals aged 50 years and older is currently 
conducted as a national gastric cancer prevention program.
AIMS: We aimed to evaluate which strategy was the most optimal and 
cost-effective among HP eradication strategy, annual, biennial, and triennial 
endoscopic screening, and no screening as a national gastric cancer prevention 
program.
METHODS: We developed a state-transition model for HP eradication strategy, 
annual, biennial, and triennial endoscopic screening, and no screening using a 
healthcare payer perspective and a lifetime horizon. We targeted a hypothetical 
cohort of the Japanese population in their 20 s to 80 s. The main outcomes were 
costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios, gastric cancer cases, and deaths from gastric cancer. We performed 
one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: HP eradication strategy was more cost-effective than endoscopic 
screening at any interval in all age groups. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to 
HP infection rate. Cost-effective acceptability curves by Monte Carlo 
simulations for 10,000 trials demonstrated that HP eradication strategy was 100% 
cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$50,000 per QALY gained in 
all age groups. Over a lifetime, HP eradication strategy saves US$28.07 billion, 
increases 37.16 million QALYs, prevents 4.47 million gastric cancer cases, and 
saves 319,870 lives from gastric cancer.
CONCLUSION: A population-based HP eradication strategy is optimal and 
cost-effective for a national gastric cancer prevention program in Japan, 
replacing the current secondary prevention-focused biennial endoscopic 
screening."
896,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) signal characteristics of skull base chordoma and radiosurgical outcomes.
METHODS: Twenty-four patients with skull base chordomas treated with Gamma Knife 
radiosurgery (GKRS) after previous surgical resection were retrospectively 
(2001-2021) examined. Pre-GKRS MRIs were analyzed for RT2 (tumor-to-brainstem 
signal intensity ratio on T2-weighted imaging), RCE (tumor-to-brainstem signal 
intensity ratio on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging), and mean apparent 
diffusion coefficient (ADC). Correlations of the parameters with patient 
survival and local tumor progression were made by using Cox regression and 
Kaplan-Meier analyses.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 46 months after GKRS, 9 patients died with 
significantly more local tumor progression events (median number: 2 vs 0, 
P = .012) than did 15 alive patients. On multivariable analysis, higher mean ADC 
was associated with longer patient survival (P = .016) after GKRS. The actuarial 
5-year overall survival rates were 88.9% versus 54.7% for chordomas with an ADC 
of ≥ 1270 × 10-6 mm2/s versus < 1270 × 10-6 mm2/s. RT2 < 1.5 (P = .038) and 
RCE > 1.57 (P = .022) were associated with a lower probability of local tumor 
control.
CONCLUSION: Lower mean ADC values are associated with shorter patient survival 
in skull base chordomas after GKRS. Diffusion-weighted imaging may help in GKRS 
planning and outcome prediction for these patients."
897,"Compelling pieces of epidemiological, clinical, and experimental research have 
demonstrated that Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor associated with 
increased cancer incidence and mortality in many human neoplasms. In the 
pathophysiology context of DM, many of the main classical actors are relevant 
elements that can fuel the different steps of the carcinogenesis process. 
Hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, metabolic inflammation, and dyslipidemia are 
among the classic contributors to this association. Furthermore, new emerging 
actors have received particular attention in the last few years, and compelling 
data support that the microbiome, the epigenetic changes, the reticulum 
endoplasmic stress, and the increased glycolytic influx also play important 
roles in promoting the development of many cancer types. The arsenal of 
glucose-lowering therapeutic agents used for treating diabetes is wide and 
diverse, and a growing body of data raised during the last two decades has tried 
to clarify the contribution of therapeutic agents to this association. However, 
this research area remains controversial, because some anti-diabetic drugs are 
now considered as either promotors or protecting elements. In the present 
review, we intend to highlight the compelling epidemiological shreds of evidence 
that support this association, as well as the mechanistic contributions of many 
of these potential pathological mechanisms, some controversial points as well as 
future challenges."
898,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most aggressive malignant tumors in human 
beings. Tumor capacity of evading immune-mediated lysis is a critical step in PC 
malignant progression. We aimed to evaluate the underlying regulatory mechanism 
of miR-4299 in the proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis, and immune escape in 
PC. miR-4299 and ADAM17 expressions in PC tissues and cell lines were detected 
using qRT-PCR. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to detect cell viability 
and apoptosis, respectively. A luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to 
confirm the targeted relationship between miR-4299 and ADAM17. Xenograft tumors 
in nude mice were used to detect tumorigenesis in vivo. PC cells were 
co-cultured with NK cells for determining the immune escape ability. 
NKG2D-positive rate of NK cells was detected using flow cytometry; NK 
cell-killing ability was detected using MTT assay. miR-4299 was downregulated in 
PC tissues and cell lines. miR-4299 inhibited PC cell proliferation and 
invasion, promoted cell apoptosis, and reduced PC tumor growth in vivo. ADAM17 
3'UTR directly bound to miR-4299. ADAM17 overexpression could reverse miR-4299 
effects on PC cell viability, invasion, apoptosis, and immune escape. miR-4299 
exerted suppressive effects on PC cell proliferation, invasion, and immune 
escape via targeting ADAM17 expression. This study revealed a novel 
miR-4299/ADAM17 axis-modulating PC progression and proposed to concern the 
immune regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in PC development."
899,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the performance of 
respiratory-gating imaging with reduced acquisition time using the total-body 
positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanner.
METHODS: Imaging data of 71 patients with suspect malignancies who underwent 
total-body 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET/CT for 15 min with respiration 
recorded were analyzed. For each examination, four reconstructions were 
performed: Ungated-15, using all coincidences; Ungated-5, using data of the 
first 5 min; Gated-15 using all coincidences but with respiratory gating; and 
Gated-6 using data of the first 6 min with respiratory gating. Lesions were 
quantified and image quality was evaluated; both were compared between the four 
image sets.
RESULTS: A total of 390 lesions were found in the thorax and upper abdomen. 
Lesion detectability was significantly higher in gated-15 (97.2%) than in 
ungated-15 (93.6%, p = 0.001) and ungated-5 (92.3%, p = 0.001), but comparable 
to Gated-6 (95.9%, p = 0.993). A total of 131 lesions were selected for 
quantitative analyses. Lesions in Gated-15 presented significantly larger 
standardized uptake values, tumor-to-liver ratio, and tumor-to-blood ratio, but 
smaller metabolic tumor volume, compared to those in Ungated-15 and Ungated-5 
(all p < 0.001). These differences were more obvious in small lesions and in 
lesions from sites other than mediastinum/retroperitoneum. However, these 
indices were not significantly different between Gated-15 and Gated-6. Higher, 
but acceptable, image noise was identified in gated images than in ungated 
images.
CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory-gating imaging with reduced scanning time using the 
total-body PET/CT scanner is superior to ungated imaging and can be used in the 
clinic.
KEY POINTS: • In PET imaging, respiratory gating can improve lesion presentation 
and detectability but requires longer imaging time. • This single-center study 
showed that the total-body PET scanner allows respiratory-gated imaging with 
reduced and clinically acceptable scanning time."
900,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate risk factors of prolonged urine leak 
following partial nephrectomy (PN) to identify objective imaging characteristics 
on preoperative CT.
METHODS: A total of 865 patients who underwent PN and had preoperative CT and 
postoperative imaging were included. We set a twofold size-matched control group 
without urine leak, with all tumors located ≤ 4 mm to the collecting system to 
identify imaging parameters that increase the risk of urine leak other than 
tumor size and location. Four CT parameters that show the relationship of the 
tumor and collecting system, namely, curvilinear border length, protruding 
distance, margin at the interface, and pelvicalyceal contact, were analyzed. 
Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant 
predictors of urine leak. The diagnostic performance of the significant 
parameters was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: Fifty-three of 865 patients (6.1%) demonstrated urine leak. Compared 
with the control group, urine leak group showed longer curvilinear border 
length, longer protruding distance, frequent non-smooth contact interface, and 
frequent direct pelvicalyceal contact (p < 0.05 for all). In the multivariate 
analysis, pelvicalyceal contact was the independent predictor of urine leak (OR 
= 2.62; 95% C.I 1.02-6.63). Combining four CT parameters, an AUC of 0.70 with a 
sensitivity of 58.5% and a specificity of 79.2% for identifying urine leak after 
PN could be obtained.
CONCLUSIONS: The four CT features that describe the relationship between the 
tumor and collecting system might be useful for evaluating the risk of urine 
leak before PN.
KEY POINTS: • Four CT parameters (curvilinear border length, protruding 
distance, margin at the interface, and pelvicalyceal contact) were significantly 
associated with postoperative urine leak after partial nephrectomy. • A 
comprehensive preoperative imaging evaluation of the relationship between the 
tumor and renal sinus may help in selecting the optimal surgical options and 
afford better patient counseling of complication risk."
901,"BACKGROUND: Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) was previously reported to be an 
independent factor associated with survival in locally advanced esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (LAESCC) patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
(NAC); however, the detailed clinicopathological significance of LVI remains 
unclear. This study evaluated the prognostic impact of LVI in patients with 
LAESCC after NAC with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (CF) or docetaxel, cisplatin 
and 5-fluorouracil (DCF) followed by surgery and in LAESCC patients with 
recurrence after NAC and surgery.
METHODS: 438 patients with thoracic LAESCC who had undergone NAC followed by an 
esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy were assessed using a propensity 
score matched analysis, and their long-term outcomes were retrospectively 
reviewed.
RESULTS: In matched cohort, a multivariate analysis of relapse-free survival 
(RFS) in the NAC-CF group suggested that ypN (≥ 1, HR = 3.715, p = 0.004) and 
LVI (positive, HR = 3.366, p = 0.012) were independent factors associated with 
RFS; in the NAC-DCF group, ypN (≥ 1, HR = 4.829, p < 0.001) was the only 
independent factor associated with RFS. Comparisons of overall survival (OS) 
between the ypN + /LVI + group and other groups among patients with recurrence 
in each NAC regimen showed significant differences in both of NAC groups 
(p < 0.001, respectively). The ypN + /LVI + group had a significantly poor OS in 
both an oligometastatic recurrence (OMR) group (p < 0.001) and a non-OMR group 
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that the independent factor associated 
with prognosis of patients with LAESCC after NAC and surgery may differ 
according to the NAC regimen, and the presence of both ypN and LVI was a 
prognostic factor for patients with recurrence, including those with OMR. These 
results might be helpful when deciding on an additional treatment strategy for 
LAESCC patients."
902,"PURPOSE: A significant portion of patients with locally advanced head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) relapse despite multimodality treatment denoting 
the need for biomarkers. The pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) is a recently 
developed blood count-based prognostic biomarker. We evaluated the relationship 
between PIV and survival in locally advanced HNSCC patients treated with 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT).
METHODS: A total of 199 patients who underwent CRT at Hacettepe University 
Oncology Hospital were included. The relationship between clinical and 
laboratory parameters with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) 
was analyzed by multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: The median age was 59 years and 90.5% of the patients were male. 66.8% 
of the patients had laryngeal primaries, and 78.9% had T3-T4 disease. 84.9% of 
the patients received CRT with cisplatin. The optimal PIV threshold value was 
calculated as 404 in ROC analyses. This PIV value had 75.8% sensitivity and 
70.4% specificity for OS prediction (AUC 0.781; 95% CI 0.715-0.846; p < 0.001). 
In multivariate analyses, high PIV levels (≤ 404 vs. > 404, HR 2.862; 95% CI 
1.553-5.276; p = 0.001), higher NLR (≤ 2.5 vs. > 2.5, HR 1.827; 95% CI 
1.017-3.281; p = 0.044) levels and ECOG performance score of 2 (HR 2.267; 95% CI 
1.385-3.711; p = 0.001) were associated with shorter OS. These factors were 
associated with shorter DFS also (HR for PIV 2.485, 95% CI 1.383-4.467, 
p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: We observed shorter OS and DFS in locally advanced HNSCC patients 
with high PIV levels. If prospective studies support our findings, the PIV score 
could be a prognostic biomarker in HNSCC."
903,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to investigate whether the combined PET/CT 
radiomic features of the primary tumor and lymph node could predict lymph node 
metastasis (LNM) of resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in stage T2-4.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 192 NSCLC patients who underwent 
tumor and node dissection between August 2016 and December 2017 and underwent 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT scanning 1-3 weeks before surgery. In 
total, 192 primary tumors (> 3 cm) and 462 lymph nodes (LN > 0.5 cm) were 
analyzed. The pretreatment clinical features of these patients were recorded, 
and the radiomic features of their primary tumor and lymph node were extracted 
from PET/CT imaging. The Spearman's relevance combined with the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator was used for radiomic feature selection. Five 
independent machine learning models (multi-layer perceptron, extreme Gradient 
Boosting, light gradient boosting machine, gradient boosting decision tree, and 
support vector machine) were tested as classifiers for model development. We 
developed the following three models to predict LNM: tumor PET/CT-clinical 
(TPC), lymph PET/CT-clinical (LPC), and tumor and lymph PET/CT-clinical (TLPC). 
The performance of the models and the clinical node (cN) staging was evaluated 
using the ROC curve and confusion matrix analysis.
RESULTS: The ROC analysis showed that among the three models, the TLPC model had 
better predictive clinical utility and efficiency in predicting LNM of NSCLC 
(AUC = 0.93, accuracy = 85%; sensitivity = 0.93; specificity = 0.75) than both 
the TPC model (AUC = 0.54, accuracy = 50%; specificity = 0.38; 
sensitivity = 0.59) and the LPC model (AUC = 0.82, accuracy = 70%; 
specificity = 0.41; sensitivity = 0.92). The TLPC model also exhibited great 
potential in predicting the N2 stage in NSCLC (AUC = 0.94, accuracy = 79%; 
specificity = 0.64; sensitivity = 0.91).
CONCLUSION: The combination of CT and PET radiomic features of the primary tumor 
and lymph node showed great potential for predicting LNM of resectable T2-4 
NSCLC. The TLPC model can non-invasively predict lymph node metastasis in NSCLC, 
which may be helpful for clinicians to develop more rational therapeutic 
strategies."
904,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of tumour-to-muscle (T/M) 
ratios and Patlak Ki images extracted from whole-body dynamic 
18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET/CT Patlak multi-parameter imaging for 
evaluating the early radiosensitizing effect of oleanolic acid (OA). Twenty-four 
rats with C6 gliomas were divided into 4 groups and treated with OA (group B), 
radiotherapy (group C), both (group D) or neither (group A). Whole-body dynamic 
18F-FMISO PET/CT scans were performed for 120 min before treatment and 24 h 
following the treatment course. The tumour samples were dissected for 
hematoxylin and eosin staining, and HIF-1α, Ki-67 and GLUT-1 immunohistochemical 
staining. PET images were analysed using kinetic modelling (Patlak Ki) and 
static analysis (T/M ratios), and correlated with immunohistochemical results. 
The changes in T/M ratios, Ki values and tumour volume before treatment and 24 h 
following the treatment course were compared, and the survival time of 
tumour-bearing rats was recorded. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that OA combined 
with radiotherapy can inhibit tumour growth and prolong the survival time of 
tumour-bearing rats. Whole-body dynamic 18F-FMISO PET/CT showed that the Ki 
values in group D were significantly lower than those in group C, whilst there 
was no significant difference in T/M ratios between groups C and D. The Pearson 
correlation coefficient analysis showed that Ki values were significantly 
related to immunohistochemical results. Our study suggests that Patlak Ki images 
may add value to PET/CT static images for evaluating the early radio-sensitizing 
effect of OA."
905,"OBJECTIVE: The haematopoietic cytopenia (HC) of the cyclin-dependent kinase 
(CDK)4/6 inhibitors was evaluated using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse 
Event Reporting System (FAERS).
METHOD: Data from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2021 has been retrieved from the 
FAERS database. Disproportionality analysis and Bayesian analysis were utilized 
in the data mining. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for HC was calculated for each CDK 4/6 inhibitor agent. Clinical features 
of the patients were collected and compared between death outcome and non-death 
outcome groups. Time to onset (TTO), proportion of deaths, life-threatening and 
hospitalizations of CDK 4/6 inhibitors-associated HC were also studied.
RESULTS: A total of 17,235 cases of HC associated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors were 
identified with a median age of 65 years (interquartile range [IQR] 57-73). 
Palbociclib appeared the strongest signal, with the highest (ROR 9.64, 95% CI 
9.46-9.83), followed by ribociclib (ROR 6.38, 95% CI 6.04-6.73) and then 
abemaciclib (ROR 2.72, 95% CI 2.49-2.97). Patients aged 18-64 had a higher 
proportion of deaths than those aged 65-84 (12.21% vs. 9.91%, p = 0.001). In 
Africa and Asia, the proportions of deaths were higher (31.65% and 26.13%, 
respectively). The median TTO was 26 days (IQR 14-65) for abemaciclib, 33 days 
(IQR 15-134) for palbociclib and 23 days (IQR 14-69) for ribociclib, 
respectively. The highest proportion of deaths, life-threatening and 
hospitalizations all occurred in abemaciclib (13.00%, 5.42% and 44.04%, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Greater proportions of deaths occurred in Africa and Asia. HC may 
occur early in any CDK 4/6 inhibitor regimen. Abemaciclib had the highest 
proportion of deaths, life-threatening and hospitalizations. Health care workers 
should be more concerned about CDK 4/6 inhibitors. The higher proportions of 
serious events, including deaths, from Africa and Asia, as well as for 
abemaciclib, deserve further investigations through additional 
pharmacoepidemiological approaches."
906,"H2AX is a histone H2A variant that becomes phosphorylated upon genotoxic stress. 
The phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX) plays an antioncogenic role in the DNA damage 
response and its foci patterns are highly variable, in terms of intensities and 
sizes. However, whether characteristic γ-H2AX foci patterns are associated with 
oncogenesis (oncogenic-specific γ-H2AX foci patterns) remains unknown. We 
previously reported that a defect in the acetyltransferase activity of TIP60 
promotes cancer cell growth in human cell lines. In this study, we compared 
γ-H2AX foci patterns between TIP60 wild-type cells and TIP60 HAT mutant cells by 
using machine learning. When focused solely on the intensity and size of γ-H2AX 
foci, we extracted the TIP60 HAT mutant-like oncogenic-specific γ-H2AX foci 
pattern among all datasets of γ-H2AX foci patterns. Furthermore, by using the 
dimensionality reduction method UMAP, we also observed TIP60 HAT mutant-like 
oncogenic-specific γ-H2AX foci patterns in TIP60 wild-type cells. In summary, we 
propose the existence of an oncogenic-specific γ-H2AX foci pattern and the 
importance of a machine learning approach to extract oncogenic signaling among 
the γ-H2AX foci variations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

907,"Exosome-based liquid biopsy technologies play an increasingly prominent role in 
tumor diagnosis. However, the simple and sensitive method for counting exosomes 
still faces considerable challenges. In this work, the CD63 aptamer-modified DNA 
tetrahedrons on the gold electrode were used as recognition elements for the 
specific capture of exosomes. Partially complementary DNA probes act as bridges 
linking trapped exosomes and three AuNP-DNA signal probes. This clover-like 
structure can tackle the recognition and sensitivity issues arising from the 
undesired AuNP aggregation event. When cancerous exosomes are present in the 
system, the high accumulation of methylene blue molecules from DNA-AuNP 
nanocomposites on the surface of the electrode leads to an intense current 
signal. According to the results, the aptasensor responds to MCF-7 cell-derived 
exosomes in the concentration range from 1.0 × 103 to 1.0 × 108 particles·μL-1, 
with the detection limit of 158 particles·μL-1. Furthermore, the aptasensor has 
been extended to serum samples from breast cancer patients and exhibited 
excellent specificity. To sum it up, the aptasensor is sensitive, 
straightforward, less expensive, and fully capable of receiving widespread 
application in clinics for tumor monitoring."
908,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Lenalidomide is considered a standard of care in 
multiple myeloma (MM) Some MM patients will develop delayed hypersensitivity to 
lenalidomide, which can lead to treatment discontinuation. Desensitization to 
lenalidomide can help these patients to complete treatment courses. Here, we 
aimed to review lenalidomide-treated MM patients who developed delayed 
hypersensitivity-induced rash and were treated with desensitization.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of medical files of MM patients, who were 
desensitized to lenalidomide due to delayed hypersensitivity rash. Patients were 
treated between 2018 and 2022 at Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.
RESULTS: Search of patients yielded 16 patients that underwent desensitization 
to lenalidomide within the study period. Desensitization protocol consisted of a 
slow, 3-week long protocol with lenalidomide's target doses of 10, 15 and 25 
mg/day. Of the 16 patients , 10 (62.5%) succeeded to complete the protocol , 
thus were able to complete lenalidomide treatment cycles. . One patient with 
unsuccessful desensitization was subsequently treated with the first generation 
IMiD thalidomide, with no rash appearing. None of the patients that were treated 
with desensitization had severe immune-mediated or non-dermatological adverse 
reactions.
CONCLUSIONS: Desensitization to lenalidomide is safe and effective. 
Discontinuation of lenalidomide in MM patients with delayed hypersensitivity and 
no contraindication to desensitization should be discouraged. Collaboration 
between hematologists and allergists is needed. This article is protected by

909,"A standardized imaging protocol for pediatric oncology patients is essential for 
accurate and efficient imaging, while simultaneously promoting collaborative 
understanding of pathologies and radiologic assessment of treatment response. 
The objective of this article is to provide standardized pediatric imaging 
guidelines and parameters for evaluation of tumors of the pediatric orbit, 
calvarium, skull base, and temporal bone. This article was drafted based on

910,"BACKGROUND: National advisory panels (NAPs) have been established for the care 
of children and young people (CYP) with cancer in the United Kingdom since 2011, 
with an increase in panel number in recent years. Their practice has not 
previously been reviewed; therefore, we sought to evaluate the role, practice 
and impact of six selected NAPs offering expertise in ependymoma, histiocytosis, 
leukaemia, neuroblastoma, renal tumours and sarcoma.
PROCEDURE: This service evaluation used mixed methodology, including review of 
NAP documentation, semi-structured interviews with the NAP chairs and an 
analysis of the cases referred for discussion.
RESULTS: Total 1110 referrals were analysed. Results demonstrated the 
significant scope and amount of work undertaken by the NAPs, largely testament 
to the commitment of the panel members. Specific roles fulfilled have been 
highlighted, and NAP recommendations have been shown to influence clinical 
decision-making and be implemented in the majority of cases. Despite widespread 
good practice, areas to address have been identified; these include clarity 
regarding NAP membership, consistency in recommendations, the consideration of 
holistic information to promote personalised management and the exploration of 
wider multidisciplinary team roles.
CONCLUSIONS: In the context of increasing demand and the escalating number of 
NAPs, it is timely to consider how service improvement can be facilitated. Best 
practice guidelines have been formulated as a product of this study, to promote 
a sustainable and effective model for NAPs. Review and benchmarking national 
panel performance against these guidelines will drive high standards of care 
going forward and they should be embedded as standard practice."
911,"Hematological toxicity (hematotoxicity) leading to peripheral cytopenias is a 
common long-term adverse effect following the use of CD19-chimeric antigen 
receptor (CD19-CAR) T-cell therapies. However, management remains unclear for 
patients whose cytopenias persist beyond 1 month after CAR T-cell infusion. We 
present the case of a 21-year old who received CD19-CAR T-cell therapy for 
relapse following a haploidentical transplant. He developed hematotoxicity and 
consequently multiple life-threatening infections. We administered a CD34+ 
hematopoietic stem cell boost (HSCB) from his transplant donor, which led to 
hematopoietic recovery and resolution of his infections without any effect on 
the activity of CD19-CAR T cells. CD34+ HSCB can be a safe and effective option 
to treat hematotoxicity following CD19-CAR T-cell therapy."
912,"BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is a potential 
prognostic factor for tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), and is associated 
with oral epithelial dysplasia grade in oral leukoplakia (OL).
METHODS: thirty cases of TSCC and thirty cases of OL were analyzed. FGFR1 and 
p-AKT protein expression were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and quantified 
using a digital algorithm. FGFR1 gene amplification was analyzed by FISH in the 
TSCC cases.
RESULTS: Clinical appearance and dysplasia grade were correlated with OL 
malignant transformation. OL cases presenting high FGFR1 expression showed a 
higher risk of malignant transformation (p=0.016, HR: 7.3, 95%CI: 1.4-37.4). 
p-AKT showed faint to no expression in OL, which did not correlate with 
dysplasia grade or malignant transformation. High expression of FGFR1 and p-AKT 
were associated with poor OS and DFS in TSCC, although only FGFR1 expression was 
significantly associated to poor OS (p=0.024; HR: 4.9, 95%CI: 1.2-19.9). Cases 
presenting double FGFR1/p-AKT overexpression (n=8) showed markedly impaired OS 
(p=0.020; HR: 6.4, 95%CI: 1.3-31.1) and DFS (p=0.001, HR: 13.0, 95%CI: 
3.0-55.7). FGFR1 amplification was observed in 16.6% of TSCC cases, being 
correlated with vascular and neural invasion (p=0.001 and 0.017, respectively), 
but not with FGFR1 protein expression, OS, or DFS.
CONCLUSION: FGFR1 protein expression is an important prognostic factor in OL and 
TSCC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
913,"Context: Methylnaltrexone is a peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist 
studied in both cancer and non-cancer patients with opioid-induced constipation 
(OIC), but mostly in the outpatient setting. For adult hospitalized cancer 
patients with OIC, its effectiveness is unknown. Objectives: Describe the 
efficacy of methylnaltrexone for OIC in the inpatient setting, defined as bowel 
movement (BM) within 24 hours of methylnaltrexone administration. Methods: We 
performed a single-center, retrospective chart review of all hospitalized, adult 
patients with a cancer diagnosis who received methylnaltrexone from the 
palliative care team between January 1st, 2012 and July 1st, 2019. Results: We 
identified 194 patients. The mean age was 59, 50.5% were male and 88% were 
white. 192 patients (98%) received the 8 mg dose subcutaneously. The median oral 
morphine equivalent (OME) was 135 mg (IQR 70-354 mg). 45% (95% confidence 
interval, 38-53%) had a BM within 24 hours. Higher OME was correlated with 
successful BM, with a response in 93% (86/92) of patients receiving ≥150 OME and 
2% (2/102) of patients receiving <150 OME (P < .0001). Prior laxative use did 
not predict response at 24 hours whether these were osmotic laxatives (40.7% vs 
47.1%, P = .52), stimulant laxatives (45.7% vs 45.2%, P > .99), or stool 
softeners (44.7% vs 46.1%, P = .89). Conclusion: Methylnaltrexone has a high 
response rate when used as treatment for OIC in hospitalized adult cancer 
patients, especially for patients taking ≥150 OME."
914,"BACKGROUND: Trismus is a common symptom for patients with head and neck cancer. 
This study aimed to evaluate outcomes using the novel Trismus Intra-operative 
Release and Expansion (TIRE).
METHODS: All patients from 2012 to 2022 with histories of head and neck cancers 
and trismus treated with TIRE were included. Data examined included measured 
interincisal distance (IID) before and after treatment, and improvement or 
worsening of trismus.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients with trismus were identified, and fourteen 
underwent TIRE. All had undergone surgery, and 13 had completed radiation 
therapy prior to TIRE. Mean improvement of IID immediately after TIRE was 
18.44 ± 6.02 mm (p < 0.0001). At first follow-up (2.51 ± 3.23 months, n = 8), 
mean improvement from pre-operational measurements was 11.14 ± 9.17 mm 
(p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION: TIRE was initially successful in increasing IID in some patients, 
but sustained improvements were not consistently seen past 1 year follow-up. 
TIRE could help resolve trismus enough to proceed with options for trismus 
therapy using devices and/or mouth opening exercises."
915,"BACKGROUND: The major goal of routine follow-up in oropharyngeal squamous cell 
carcinoma (OPSCC) patients is the asymptomatic detection of new disease in order 
to improve survival. This study evaluated the effect of routine follow-up on 
overall survival (OS).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 307 consecutive OPSCC patients treated with 
curative intent between 2006 and 2012 was analyzed. The effectiveness of routine 
follow-up was studied by comparing treatment-intent and OS in patients with 
asymptomatically versus symptomatically detected new disease.
RESULTS: Three- and five-year risks of new disease were 29% (95% CI: 24-34) and 
33% (95% CI: 27-39). Of the 81 patients with locoregional recurrence or second 
primary head and neck cancer, 8 (10%) were detected asymptomatically with no 
difference in OS with those detected with symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic detection of new disease during routine visits was not 
associated with improved OS. The focus of follow-up should be on providing 
psychosocial care and rehabilitation."
916,"AIMS: To explore family carer experiences of managing the process of receiving 
and breaking bad news about cancer.
BACKGROUND: Family carers' experiences of bad news are underrepresented in the 
literature. This study involved oncology staff with personal experience of 
caregiving and carers to develop broader insights into the range of needs and 
difficulties experienced by family members in the process of managing a cancer 
diagnosis. This can help facilitate subsequent interactions with healthcare 
professionals and improve continuity of care.
DESIGN: This is a descriptive qualitative study informed by the theory of social 
constructionism. Data were analysed using template analysis.
METHODS: Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and focus groups 
with 4 healthcare professionals and 17 family carers between January and July 
2018. A purposive sampling strategy was used. Interviews were transcribed 
verbatim to explore participant experiences and perspectives on family carers 
managing a cancer diagnosis.
FINDINGS: Three key themes were identified: (1) receiving the bad news; (2) 
management of bad news and (3) interaction with healthcare and support services. 
These and associated subthemes are discussed, with recommendations for future 
research and practice.
CONCLUSIONS: There was variability in the experiences and needs of carers 
involved in receiving and breaking the bad news.
IMPACT: Although family members experienced a multitude of difficult emotions 
when the bad news was shared, they were not often able to discern help from 
healthcare professionals with sharing the diagnosis with the patient and others. 
This impacted on access to and use of healthcare and support services. 
Individualized approaches to communication are needed to enable carers to seek 
support and provide perspectives on the patient home environment and family 
structure. This can help tailor breaking the bad news and care plans.
PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Anonymised results were shared with family carers to 
validate the congruency of the codes with their experiences."
917,"BACKGROUND: Microinvasive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCCmi) is an incipient 
stage of oral cancer. Through this systematic review, we aim to assess patterns 
of histopathological outcomes reported in OSCCmi cases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online search in major databases was performed without 
period restriction, and 2,024 publications in English, Spanish and Portuguese 
were obtained. After screening and eligibility, 4 studies were selected. The 
risk of bias was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal 
Checklist. A descriptive synthesis was conducted.
RESULTS: All 4 publications included were retrospective, reporting a total of 
116 OSCCmi patients, with a male predominance (1.6:1) and a mean age of 55.9 
years. The main parameters considered for microinvasion were tumor thickness 
(TT) (range 4-10mm) and depth of invasion (DOI) (range 0,02-5mm). Definition, 
cut-off values, and assessment of microscopic features were not standardized. 
Other relevant measures such as perineural or lymphovascular invasion and 
pattern of invasive front were barely described, and cytological/architectural 
characteristics were not discussed.
CONCLUSIONS: TT and DOI are currently the primary histopathological criteria 
used to define OSCCmi. Nonetheless, the outcomes of this systematic review 
showed the absence of standardized quantitative parameters to render the 
diagnosis of microinvasive OSCC. Therefore, additional studies aiming to 
standardize histopathological features to diagnose OSCCmi are paramount."
918,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to characterize the barriers faced by Brazilian 
dentists to deliver bad news (DBN) about oral and oropharyngeal cancer diagnoses 
to patients by using a questionnaire based on the guidelines of the SPIKES 
protocol.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional study. The 
questionnaire contained 27 questions based on the SPIKES protocol, which were 
answered in the SurveyMonkey platform.
RESULTS: A total of 186/249 dentists answered the questionnaire. The main 
specialties reported were 36.02% oral medicine, 21.5% oral pathology, and 9.13% 
oral and maxillofacial surgery. A total of 44.6% expressed concern about the 
patient's emotional reactions, and 46.24% of respondents had never participated 
in any specific training to communicate bad news.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of training and low confidence in dealing with patients' 
emotional reactions dentists were considered the greatest barriers to DBNs. 
Moreover, most dentists who participated in the survey believe that a protocol 
to guide the communication of bad news would be useful for clinical practice. 
For those protocols to be used by dentists, training is critical for these 
protocols to be incorporated by professionals."
919,"BACKGROUND: Oral cancer (OC) is a growing public health problem worldwide. In 
Brazil, the National Oral Health Policy, implemented in 2004, expanded access to 
oral health services and prioritized OC care. However, it is not known whether 
this expansion resulted in a reduction in hospital admissions with death. This 
study aimed to analyze the proportion of hospital admissions who progressed to 
death due to OC in Brazil from 2007 to 2019 and its correlation with the 
coverage of health services.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study is an ecological, longitudinal, and analytical 
study of hospital admissions with death due to OC recorded in the Brazilian 
Hospital Information System. The following analyses were performed: descriptive, 
spatial (choropleth maps and Moran index), and negative binomial regression, 
with a hierarchical approach, estimating crude and adjusted regression 
coefficients (β) and respective 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) (alpha=5%).
RESULTS: In 2019, Moran's index (I) of spatial autocorrelation showed a negative 
association between hospital admissions with death and dentist 
surgeon/inhabitant rate (I=-0.176), physician/inhabitant rate (I=-0.157), family 
health strategy (FHS) coverage (I=-0.080), oral health team (OHT) coverage (I= 
-0.129), dental specialty centers (DSC)/inhabitant rate (I= -0.200), and 
oncology bed/inhabitant rate (I= -0.101). In the adjusted regression analysis, 
the proportion of hospitalizations with deaths caused by OC was higher in 
Brazilian states with a lower medical ̸inhabitant ratio (β= -0.014; p=0.040), a 
lower dentists/inhabitant ratio (β= -0.720; p=0.045), a lower number of DSC (β= 
-0.004; p<0.000), a lower amount paid per hospitalization (β= -10.350; p<0.001), 
and a lower number of biopsies (β= -0.00008; p=0.010). The proportion of 
hospitalizations that progressed to death showed a positive association with the 
number of days of hospitalization (β= 0.00002; p=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased health care coverage has decreased serious hospital 
admissions with deaths caused by OC in Brazil."
920,"BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most prevalent malignant 
head and neck tumor, excluding the nonmelanoma skin cancer. Despite recent 
advances in the diagnosis and treatment, the disease's mortality rate is 
nonetheless high. The presence of isolated neoplastic cells or small clusters of 
up to four cells at the tumor's invasive front, named tumor budding, is 
associated with a worse prognosis in OSCC. Angiogenesis has also been recognized 
as a determining factor in the progression of malignancies and in the 
development of metastases. Several studies have investigated the assessment of 
microvascular density (MVD) as a potential prognostic factor in OSCC. This study 
aimed to evaluate, in OSCC, differences in MVD between tumors with 
high-intensity tumor budding and tumors with low-intensity or no tumor budding. 
In samples with high-intensity tumor budding, differences in MVD between the 
budding area and the area outside the budding were also evaluated. Moreover, the 
study assessed differences in MVD concerning clinicopathological characteristics 
such as sex, age, tobacco smoking, tumor location and tumor size.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty [150] samples of OSCC were subjected 
to immunohistochemistry to assess the intensity of tumor budding (by 
immunostaining for multi-cytokeratin) and MVD (by immunostaining for CD34 and 
CD105, independently). The data were treated using descriptive and analytical 
statistics.
RESULTS: There were no differences in MVD, assessed by immunostaining for CD34 
or CD105, concerning clinicopathological characteristics such as sex, age, 
tobacco smoking, tumor location and tumor size (p > 0.05). Tumors with 
high-intensity tumor budding did not show differences in MVD, assessed by 
immunostaining for CD34 or CD105, when compared to tumors with low-intensity or 
no tumor budding (p > 0.05). However, in samples with high-intensity tumor 
budding, the MVD assessed by immunostaining for CD34 was higher in the budding 
area than in the area outside the budding (p < 0.05). This difference was not 
observed when MVD was assessed by immunostaining for CD105 (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The higher MVD in the budding area may be an additional indication 
that this is a peculiar region of the tumor, associated with biological 
phenomena related to tumor progression."
921,"Background Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) might not be representative of the 
real-world population because of unreasonable exclusion criteria. We sought to 
determine which groups of patients are excluded from RCTs that included 
lipid-lowering therapy. Methods and Results We retrieved all trials from the 
Cholesterol Treatment Trialists Collaboration and systematically searched for 
large (≥1000 participants) lipid-lowering therapy RCTs, defined as statins, 
ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors. We predefined groups: older adults (>70 or 
>75 years), women, non-Whites, chronic kidney failure, heart failure, 
immunosuppression, cancer, dementia, treated thyroid disease, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, mental illness, atrial fibrillation, 
multimorbidity (≥2 chronic diseases), and polypharmacy. We counted the number of 
RCTs excluding patients of the predefined groups and meta-analyzed the 
prevalence of included patients to obtain pooled estimates with a random-effects 
model. We included 42 RCTs (298 605 patients). Eighty-one percent of trials 
excluded patients with severe and 76% those with moderate kidney failure. 
Seventy-one percent of trials excluded groups of women, 64% excluded patients 
with moderate to severe heart failure, 64% those with immunosuppressant 
conditions, 48% those with cancer, 29% those with dementia, and 29% of trials 
excluded older adults. The pooled prevalence for patients >70 years of age was 
25% (95% CI, 0%-49%), 11% (3%-18%) for >75 years of age, and 51% (38%-63%) for 
multimorbidity. Conclusions The majority of lipid-lowering therapy trials 
excluded patients with common diseases, such as moderate-to-severe kidney 
disease or heart failure or with immunosuppression. Underrepresenting certain 
populations, including women and older adults, might lead to limited 
transportability of study results and uncertainty on possible side-effects and 
efficacy in these groups. Future trials should promote diversity in the 
recruitment strategies and improve equity in cardiovascular research.

922,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For accurate pre-operative gastric radiotherapy, 
intrafractional changes must be taken into account. The aim of this study is to 
quantify local gastric deformations and compare these deformations with 
respiratory-induced displacement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Coronal 2D MRI scans (15-16 min; 120 repetitions of 25-27 
interleaved slices) were obtained for 18 healthy volunteers. A deep-learning 
network was used to auto-segment the stomach. To separate out 
respiratory-induced displacements, auto-segmentations were rigidly shifted in 
superior-inferior (SI) direction to align the centre of mass (CoM) within every 
slice. From these shifted auto-segmentations, 3D iso-probability surfaces 
(isosurfaces) were established: a reference surface for POcc  = 0.50 and 50 
other isosurfaces (from POcc  = 0.01 to 0.99), with POcc indicating the 
probability of occupation by the stomach. For each point on the reference 
surface, distances to all isosurfaces were determined and a cumulative Gaussian 
was fitted to this probability-distance dataset to obtain a standard deviation 
(SDdeform ) expressing local deformation. For each volunteer, we determined 
median and 98th percentile of SDdeform over the reference surface and compared 
these with the respiratory-induced displacement SDresp , that is, the SD of all 
CoM shifts (paired Wilcoxon signed-rank, α = 0.05).
RESULTS: Larger deformations were mostly seen in the antrum and pyloric region. 
Median SDdeform (range, 2.0-2.9 mm) was smaller than SDresp (2.7-8.8 mm) for 
each volunteer (p < 0.00001); 98th percentile of SDdeform (3.2-7.3 mm) did not 
significantly differ from SDresp (p = 0.13).
CONCLUSION: Locally, gastric deformations can be large. Overall, however, these 
deformations are limited compared to respiratory-induced displacement. 
Therefore, unless respiratory motion is considerably reduced, the need to 
separately include these deformation uncertainties in the treatment margins may 
be limited."
923,"In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) leads to 
disease progression. Strategies to overcome the resistance are required in 
treatment for advanced lung cancer. In this study, we investigated the 
therapeutic effect of afatinib and HangAmDan-B1 (HAD-B1) co-administration in 
gefitinib-resistant NSCLC using HCC827-GR, NSCLC cell line with gefitinib 
resistance, and the HCC827-GR cell implanted mouse model. HAD-B1 consists of 4 
herbs, Panax notoginseng Radix, Cordyceps militaris, Panax ginseng C. A. Mey, 
and Boswellia carteri Birdwood, and has been reported to be effective in 
patients with advanced lung cancer in clinical practice. Our findings 
demonstrated that HAD-B1 combined with afatinib markedly inhibited cell 
proliferation and induced apoptosis compared to afatinib monotherapy and HAD-B1 
monotherapy. Inhibition of HCC827-GR cell proliferation by HAD-B1 occurred 
through MET amplification and reduced phosphorylation, and the synergistic 
effect of afatinib and HAD-B1 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in 
HCC827-GR cells via the downregulation of ERK and mTOR signaling pathways. In 
hematology and biochemistry tests, HAD-B1 alleviated the toxicity of tumor. In 
conclusion, HAD-B1 combined with afatinib would be a promising therapeutic 
strategy for NSCLC with EGFR-TKI resistance."
924,"OBJECTIVE: To report the feasibility and effectiveness of a newly developed 
clinical exercise program for improving maximal cardiorespiratory fitness in 
Spanish cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. We also 
examined the effectiveness of the exercise program for improving maximal 
muscular strength, body composition, fatigue, and quality of life, and explored 
if the effectiveness varied based on selected patient characteristics.
DESIGN: The study was a single group implementation feasibility study using a 
pre-posttest design.
METHODS: Participants performed a 12-week, twice-weekly, supervised, 
multi-component exercise program during adjuvant therapy. Paired t-tests were 
used to assess pre-post changes, and analyses of covariance were used to compare 
effectiveness based on selected patient characteristics.
RESULTS: We had 100 cancer patients referred to the clinical exercise program of 
which 85 (85%) initiated the exercise program and 76 (89%) completed the 
post-intervention fitness assessment. Exercise significantly improved VO2max by 
4.8 mL/kg/minutes (P < .001, d = 0.74). Exercise also significantly improved 
chest strength (P < .001, d = 0.82), leg strength (P < .001, d = 1.27), lean 
body mass (P < .001, d = 0.11), skeletal muscle mass (P < .001; d = 0.09), fat 
mass (P < .001; d = 0.10), % body fat (P < .001; d = 0.17), quality of life 
(P = .0017; d = 0.41), and fatigue (P = .007; d = 0.46). Treatment modality, 
cancer type, and age affected some exercise responses, especially related to 
body composition changes.
CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week, supervised, multi-component exercise program was 
effective for improving health-related fitness and quality of life in Spanish 
cancer patients receiving adjuvant therapy. Our results show the benefits of 
incorporating clinical exercise programming into the supportive care of cancer 
patients receiving treatments.

925,"BACKGROUND: The association between cataracts and cognitive functions has been 
reported in several studies. However, the dynamic trajectories of cognitive 
changes in patients with cataracts remain unelucidated.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the dynamic trajectories of 
cognitive changes in patients with cataracts.
METHODS: This observational cohort study recruited 1,146 patients with 
age-related cataracts (ARC) from the Department of Ophthalmology, Daping 
Hospital, from September 2020 to November 2021. The cognitive functions of the 
patients were assessed using a Chinese version of the Telephone Interview of 
Cognitive Status-40 (TICS-40) test at baseline and 6 months of follow-up. The 
trajectories and the associated risk factors for the longitudinal cognitive 
decline during the 6-month follow-up were investigated.
RESULTS: Patients with severe ARC [median (IQR): 0 month, 24 (22, 25); 6 months, 
23 (21,25)] had lower TICS-40 scores than those with non-severe ARC [0 month, 31 
(24, 33), p <  0.001; 6 months, 31 (23,33), p <  0.001] and controls [0 month, 
32 (28, 35), p <  0.001; 6 months, 32 (28, 35), p <  0.001] at both baseline and 
6 months of follow-up. Age (OR: 1.311, 95% CI: 1.229 to 1.398) and cataract 
grade (OR: 5.569, 95% CI: 2.337 to 13.273) were found to be the risk factors of 
cognitive decline as indicated by a decrease in the TICS-40 scores.
CONCLUSION: ARC is associated with an increased risk of longitudinal cognitive 
decline; however, the reversibility of such declines needs to be investigated 
further."
926,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the major human 
health challenges with minimal therapeutic benefits due to its late detection, 
and de novo - and acquired chemotherapy resistance.
OBJECTIVE: In this work we unravel the potential pro-survival role of RAB25 in 
pancreatic cancer chemotherapy resistance and aim to identify if RAB25is a 
prognostic marker of patients' survival in PDA.
METHODS: We used RNA sequencing, shRNA mediated gene knockdown, BioGRID open 
repository of CRISPR screens (ORCS), GEPIA, kmplot.com, and cBioPortal.org 
databases to identify the role of RAB25 in PDA cell proliferation, chemotherapy 
response, expression in tumour versus normal tissues, and overall patients' 
survival.
RESULTS: RNA sequencing show Rab25 to be one of the top upregulated genes in 
gemcitabine resistant mouse PDA cells. Knockdown of Rab25 in these cells 
enhanced gemcitabine toxicity. In addition, re-analysis of previously published 
CRISPR/Cas9 data confirm RAB25 to be responsible for chemotherapy resistance in 
KRASG12D mutant human pancreatic cancer cell line. Finally, we used publicly 
available TCGA datasets and identify the upregulation of RAB25 in tumour tissues 
compared to the adjacent normal tissue, co-occurrence of KRASG12 mutations with 
RAB25 amplifications, and poor patients' survival in cohorts with higher mRNA 
expression of RAB25.
CONCLUSION: RAB25 expression is a prognostic marker for patient's survival and 
gemcitabine resistance in PDA."
927,"BACKGROUND: Fibroadenomas are common among young females. The size of the lesion 
used to be an indication for further assessment or excision. With arising of the 
watch and see proponents, criteria for selecting patients are important to 
establish.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study of a prospectively maintained database 
where all patients having the clinical/radiological provisional diagnosis of 
fibroadenoma and attending our center - from January 2008 to March 2020 - were 
enrolled. The primary outcome was the incidence of malignancy and the secondary 
outcomes were the correlation of malignancy-risk with epidemiologic and 
radiologic criteria.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 1392 patients. The mean age of the patients was 35.7 
+ ∕- 13.1 years. The median of the longest diameter of the detected breast 
lesions was 25 mm. The incidence of malignancy was 188 (13.5%). The size of the 
lesion measured by largest diameter was insignificant (p = 0.99), while the 
patients' age, marital status, and imaging criteria as measured by BIRADS score 
were significant (<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Approaching patients with the age above 35 or with BIRADS 4 
provisionally diagnosed with fibroadenomas should be cautious with biopsy and 
short-term follow-ups The size of the tumor alone should not be used as an 
indication for surgical intervention."
928,"BACKGROUND: Molecular breast imaging uses Tc-99 m sestamibi to obtain functional 
images of the breast. Determining the Tc-99 m sestamibi uptake in volumes of 
interest in the breast may be useful in assessing the response to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy or for the purposes of breast cancer risk assessment.
PURPOSE: To determine, using Monte Carlo simulation, if emission tomography can 
be used to quantify the uptake of Tc-99 m sestamibi in molecular breast imaging 
and if so, to determine the accuracy as a function of the number of projections 
used in the reconstruction process.
METHODS: In this study, two voxelized breast models are implemented with 
different ratios of fibroglandular to fatty tissue and tumoral masses of varying 
dimensions. Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate sets of projections, 
which assumes that each tumoral mass contains a given Tc-99 m activity. 
Projections are also calculated for a calibration phantom in order to correlate 
the known activity with the image pixel value. For each case, the total number 
of calculated projections is 36 and the reconstruction is carried out for 36, 
18, 9, 7 and 5 projections, respectively, using an open source image 
reconstruction toolbox.
RESULTS: Study data show that determination of Tc-99 m sestamibi uptake with and 
average error of 7% can be carried out with as little as 7 projections.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular breast emission tomography enables to accurately 
determine the Tc-99 m sestamibi tumoral mass uptake with the number of 
projections very close to the number of images currently acquired in clinical 
practice."
929,"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients suffer from different losses. Studies have focused 
on examining grief resulting from cancer diagnosis and grief among caregivers of 
cancer patients and parents who lost their child to cancer. However, there are 
no studies on the grief resulting from losing a loved one in cancer patients.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined female breast cancer patients' grief and aimed to 
reveal how palliative care can help breast cancer who experience the grief of 
losing a loved one.
METHODS: The study applied the qualitative case study design conducted with 10 
women with breast cancer; their ages ranged from 47 to 54 years. Data were 
collected during 18 in-depth interviews by asking semi-open-closed questions.
RESULTS: Thematic analysis found that losing a partner negatively affected 
breast cancer patients' mental health. The grief experience among breast cancer 
patients has many symptoms: sadness, severe anxiety, sleep disturbance, 
loneliness, and isolation. Results also indicated many risk factors that 
increase grief symptoms among breast cancer patients, such as quarantine 
procedures during the COVID-19 outbreak, extreme emotional attachment to a 
partner, guilt, self-blame, and social relations. Patients with breast cancer 
can face grief experienced by coping strategies such as: resorting to God, 
prayer, patience, and reading the Holy Qur'an. The results also emphasize the 
importance of integrating palliative care with treatment for breast cancer 
patients who experience the grief of loss.
CONCLUSION: The grief of loss among breast cancer patients is a complex 
experience. These findings have many applied aspects that benefit planning 
counseling and psychological programs to increase positive coping strategies for 
those patients with breast cancer suffering from grief of loss disorder and 
provide psychological services that protect them from risk factors and reduce 
grief symptoms which reduce the effectiveness of cancer treatments due to the 
symptoms of traumatic loss of a partner. These findings also emphasize the 
importance of palliative care for cancer patients with complex distress."
930,"Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) generally shows low or undetectable 
expression in most normal tissues but is highly expressed in fibroblasts in 
almost all carcinomas. FAP is one of the potential molecules to detect activated 
fibroblasts and has multiple roles in tumour progression. We generated 
transgenic mice that specifically expressed tdTomato along with FAP promoter 
activity. Coculturing a mouse gastric cancer cell line and FAP-tdTomato 
transgenic mouse-derived fibroblasts showed that tdTomato expression was 
elevated in the cocultured fibroblasts. Moreover, stomach wall transplanted 
tumours in mice also showed FAP-tdTomato expression in fibroblasts of the 
stomach and each metastatic legion. These results indicated that FAP-tdTomato 
expression in fibroblasts was elevated by stimulation through the interaction 
with cancer cells. Functionally, collagen production was increased in 
FAP/tdTomato-positive fibroblasts cocultured with mouse cancer cells. These 
FAP-tdTomato transgenic mice have the potential to be used to investigate 
real-time FAP dynamics and the importance of FAP expression in tumour 
development."
931,"AIM: Post-embolization syndrome is a common adverse event following 
trans-arterial chemoembolization, which negatively impacts the daily life of the 
patients involved. This study examined whether perceptions around 
post-embolization syndrome and symptom interference among nurses affect their 
comfort care performance toward patients who have undergone this procedure.
DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study.
METHODS: One hundred and fifty registered nurses were surveyed from September to 
November 2020. Perceived post-embolization syndrome, symptom interference, and 
comfort care (including physical, psychospiritual, sociocultural, and 
environmental dimensions) were measured. Data were analyzed using t-tests, 
analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation, and a multivariate analysis of 
variance.
RESULTS: There were no individual effects found of perceived post-embolization 
syndrome or symptom interference on nurses' comfort care performance. However, 
statistically significant interaction effects were found in terms of their 
sociocultural and environmental care.
CONCLUSION: Nurses who recognized both high post-embolization syndrome and 
symptom interference among their patients were found to provide greater 
sociocultural and environmental care. As such, nurses should improve their early 
symptom and symptom interference detection protocols based on current care 
guidelines and provide physical, psychospiritual, sociocultural, and 
environmental comfort care."
932,"OBJECTIVE: To compare stage and survival of cervical cancer between Jewish and 
Arab women in a tertiary medical center in Israel.
METHODS: Retrospective study of consecutive women diagnosed with cervical cancer 
in a single institution between 2010-2021 were identified. We compared Jewish 
and Arab patients by univariate, multivariable and survival curves analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 207 Jewish and 45 Arab women were included with a median 
follow-up of 20 months (interquartile range 7-46 months). The groups did not 
differ in median BMI, mean age at diagnosis and menopausal status. Arab women 
had higher parity. Arabs were at a higher risk to be diagnosed with an advanced 
stage (≥2b) (84.4% vs. 57% Arabs and Jews, respectively, p<0.001). In a 
multivariable regression analysis, Arab descent (was found to be the only 
independent factor associated with advanced stage disease OR 3.95, 95% CI 
1.54-10.10. Overall and stage-specific survival was not different among the 
ethnic groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Advanced stage at diagnosis was more prevalent in Arab compared to 
Jewish women with cervical cancer, whereas stage-specific survival was similar. 
Further studies addressing possible contributing factors to inequality should be 
undertaken in order to find corrective measures."
933,"INTRODUCTION: Microscopically positive (R1) margins to lymph node metastases 
(R1LNM) are associated with poorer oncological outcomes in patients with Stage 
III colon cancer. R1LNM margins are more common in right-sided cancer, although 
the cause of this phenomenon is unknown. We sought to investigate whether 
differences in surgical quality account for the higher rate of R1LNM in 
right-sided cancers.
METHODS: Patients treated for Stage III colon cancer from 01/01/2016 - 
31/12/2018 were identified using the Danish national cancer registry. Indicators 
of surgical quality (mesocolic resection grade, median lymph node yield, and 
length to the distal colonic margin) were compared according to tumour site and 
margin status.
RESULTS: 1,765 patients were included, 981 (55.6%) with right-sided cancers. 
R1LNM margins were more common in right-sided cancers (14.4% vs 6.1%, p 
< 0.001). All three surgical quality indicators were higher in patients with 
right-sided cancers (mesocolic resection planes 81.7% vs 69.5%, p < 0.001; 
median lymph node yield 28 vs 25, p < 0.001; ≥ 5 cm to the distal colon margin 
81.2% vs 53.6%, p < 0.001). When stratified according to margin status, no 
differences in mesocolic resection planes or resectate length were noted, whilst 
median lymph node yield was higher in patients with R1LNM margins (29 vs 27, 
p=0.009).
CONCLUSION: Surgical quality does not appear to be poorer in patients undergoing 
surgery for right-sided versus left-sided colon cancers in Denmark. Suboptimal 
surgery does not appear to be responsible for R1LNM margins, implying that these 
margins may be a surrogate for more aggressive biology."
934,"Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder first 
described in 2018, mostly associated with de novo variants in the CHD3 gene that 
affects chromatin remodeling. This syndrome is characterized by developmental 
delay, speech delay, and intellectual disability, but only about 60 affected 
individuals have been reported to date. We report a de novo likely pathogenic 
CHD3 variant (c.5609G > A; p. (Arg1870Gln)) in a young female presenting with 
features of Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome including speech delay, autism 
spectrum disorder, learning difficulties, characteristic facial dysmorphisms, 
and a feature not previously described in this syndrome, idiopathic central 
precocious puberty. Her puberty was controlled with monthly injections of a GnRH 
analogue. Targeted exome sequencing was negative for genes known to be 
responsible for central precocious puberty. Our case raises the possibility that 
variants in CHD3 gene may also result in central precocious puberty. 
Strengthening this association could expand the phenotypic spectrum of the 
Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome and should be included in multigene panels for 
precocious puberty."
935,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the main 
death-leading malignant tumors which deserve in-depth explorations to uncover 
the underlying molecular mechanisms. Plenty of proofs have revealed that long 
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in malignancy and progression of HCC. 
Nevertheless, the definite role of lncRNA-SNHG4 in HCC remains vague.
METHODS: To figure out the role of SNHG4 in HCC, the bioinformatics analysis and 
functional assays and in vivo assay were performed.
RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) displayed that the higher expression of lncRNA SNHG4 was detected in HCC 
tissues, which predicted the poor prognosis. The upregulation of SNHG4 was 
positively associated with worse clinicopathological characteristics. The 
functional experiments were performed to identify the role of SNHG4 in HCC. We 
found that SNHG4 enhanced the proliferative, migratory and invasive capacities 
of HCC cell line, and facilitated the tumor growth in vivo. A series of 
follow-up studies have shown that SNHG4 promoted the progression and malignancy 
of HCC through upregulating CREB5 via sponging miR-211-5p.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, the above findings suggest that SNHG4 promotes HCC 
malignancy through the SNHG4/miR-211-5p/CREB5 axis, providing potential 
therapeutic targets and prognostic factors for HCC."
936,"CONTEXT: Thai Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC. var. pruriens (Fabaceae) or T-MP seed 
extract has been shown to improve sexual performance and sperm quality.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the preventive effects of T-MP against 
seminal vesicle damage, apoptotic and Nrf2 protein expression in mice under 
chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight male ICR mice were divided into four groups: 
control, CUMS, T-MP300 + CUMS and T-MP600 + CUMS. Mice in control and CUMS 
groups received distilled water, while those in treated groups were pretreated 
with T-MP extract (300 or 600 mg/kg BW) for 14 consecutive days. The CMUS and 
co-treated groups were exposed to one random stressor (of 12 total) each day for 
43 days. Components and histopathology of the seminal vesicle were examined, 
along with localization of androgen receptor (AR) and caspase 3. Expression of 
seminal AR, tyrosine phosphorylated (TyrPho), heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), 
caspases (3 and 9) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) 
proteins was investigated.
RESULTS: T-MP extract at a dose of 600 mg/kg BW improved seminal epithelial 
damage and secretion of fluid containing essential substances and proteins in 
CUMS mice. It also increased the expression of AR and TyrPho proteins. 
Additionally, T-MP increased expression of Nrf2 and inhibited seminal vesicular 
apoptosis through the suppression of Hsp70 and caspase expression.
CONCLUSION: T-MP seeds have an antiapoptotic property in chronic stress seminal 
vesicle. It is possible to apply this extract for the enhancement of seminal 
plasma quality."
937,"The phenotypic repercussion of ZDHHC15 haploinsufficiency is not well-known. 
This gene was initially suggested as a candidate for X-linked mental 
retardation, but such an association was later questioned. We studied a 
multiplex family with three members with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by array 
CGH, karyotype, exome sequencing and X-chromosome inactivation patterns. Medical 
history interviews, cognitive and physical examinations, and sensory profiling 
were also assessed. The three family members with ASD (with normal cognitive 
abilities and an abnormal sensory profile) were the only carriers of a 1.7 Mb 
deletion in the long arm of chromosome X, involving: ZDHHC15, MAGEE2, PBDC1, 
MAGEE1, MIR384 and MIR325. The normal chromosome X was preferentially 
inactivated in female carriers, and the whole exome sequencing of an affected 
family member did not reveal any additional genetic variant that could explain 
the phenotype. Thus, in the present family, ASD segregates with a deletion on 
chromosome X that includes ZDHHC15. Considering our results together with gene 
data (regarding function, expression, conservation and animal/cellular models), 
ZDHHC15 is a candidate gene for ASD. Emerging evidence also suggests that this 
gene could be associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders, with 
incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity."
938,"This current case report describes a 56-year-old male patient with a skin mass 
on his lip that had been growing for 1 year. The pathological findings 
demonstrated that the epidermis was characterized by hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia 
and hypertrophy and was formed in the shape of a crater. The skin on both ends 
had developed into a ball-like growth that resembled a volcanic cone. There was 
invasive growth of heterotype squamous epithelium and a small number of 
inflammatory cells infiltrating the dermis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated an 
increase in P16 (the focus, +) and the hot spot Ki-67 index. The diagnosis was 
of tumour-like hyperplasia, malignancy and moderate-to-severe dysplasia 
confirming that it was keratoacanthoma. The patient underwent surgical resection 
and was discharged from hospital, but the tumour returned. Paclitaxel and 
cisplatin were administered intraoperatively and bilateral lingual artery 
perfusion chemoembolization was undertaken six times. This procedure led to an 
excellent postoperative recovery and discharge from hospital. Tumour therapy was 
regarded as successful. The patient's medical history included acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia L1 and long-term immunosuppressant use. After a 6-month 
period of follow-up, he died from systemic organ failure as a consequence of 
having too many ailments."
939,"AIMS: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with clear cells and psammoma-like 
calcifications would often raise suspicion for MITF family translocation RCC. 
However, we have rarely encountered tumors consistent with clear cell RCC that 
contain focal psammomatous calcifications.
METHODS & RESULTS: We identified clear cell RCCs with psammomatous 
calcifications from multiple institutions and performed immunohistochemistry and 
fluorescence and RNA in situ hybridization (FISH and RNA ISH). Twenty-one tumors 
were identified: 12 men, 9 women, ages 45 to 83 years. Tumor size was 2.3 to 
14.0 cm (median 6.75 cm). Nucleolar grade was 3 (n=14), 2 (n=4), or 4 (n=3). In 
addition to clear cell pattern, morphology included eosinophilic (n=12), 
syncytial giant cell (n=4), rhabdoid (n=2), branched glandular (n=1), early 
spindle cell (n=1), and poorly differentiated components (n=1). Labeling for CA9 
was usually 80-100% of the tumor cells (n=17/21) but was sometimes decreased in 
areas of eosinophilic cells (n=4). All (19/19) were positive for CD10. Most 
(19/20) were positive for AMACR (variable staining, 20-100%). Staining was 
negative for keratin 7, although 4 showed rare positive cells (4/20). Results 
were negative for cathepsin K (0/19), melan A (0/17), HMB45 (0/17), TFE3 (0/5), 
TRIM63 RNA-ISH (0/13), and TFE3 (0/19) and TFEB rearrangements (0/12). Seven of 
19 (37%) showed chromosome 3p deletion. One (1/19) showed trisomy 7 and 17 
without papillary features.
CONCLUSIONS: Psammomatous calcifications in RCC with a clear cell pattern 
suggests a diagnosis of MITF family translocation RCC; however, psammomatous 
calcifications can rarely be found in true clear cell RCC."
940,"This review aimed to identify preclinical and clinical studies examining the 
effects of rosmarinic acid (RA), carnosic acid (CaA), rosmanol (RO), carnosol 
(CA), and ursolic acid (UA) against allergic and immunologic disorders. Various 
online databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, 
Cochrane trials, and Scopus, were searched from inception until October 2022. 
Due to the suppression of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, the main factor 
in allergic asthma, RA may be a promising candidate for the treatment of asthma. 
The other ingredients comprising CA and UA reduce the expression of interleukin 
(IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and improve airway inflammation. Rosemary's anti-cancer 
effect is mediated by several mechanisms, including DNA fragmentation, apoptosis 
induction, inhibition of astrocyte-upregulated gene-1 expression, and 
obstruction of cell cycle progression in the G1 phase. The compounds, 
essentially found in Rosemary essential oil, prevent smooth muscle contraction 
through its calcium antagonistic effects, inhibiting acetylcholine (ACH), 
histamine, and norepinephrine stimulation. Additionally, CA exhibits a 
substantially greater interaction with the nicotinic ACH receptor than a family 
of medications that relax the smooth muscles, making it a potent antispasmodic 
treatment. The components have demonstrated therapeutic effects on the immune, 
allergy, and respiratory disorders."
941,"PURPOSE: Establish a workflow to evaluate radiotherapy (RT) dose variation 
induced by respiratory and cardiac motion on the left ventricle (LV) and left 
ventricular myocardium (LVM).
METHODS: Eight lung cancer patients underwent 4D-CT, expiratory 
T1-volumetric-interpolated-breath-hold-examination (VIBE), and cine MRI scans in 
expiration. Treatment plans were designed on the average intensity projection 
(AIP) datasets from 4D-CTs. RT dose from AIP was transferred onto 4D-CT 
respiratory phases. About 50% 4D-CT dose was mapped onto T1-VIBE (following 
registration) and from there onto average cine MRI datasets. Dose from average 
cine MRI was transferred onto all cardiac phases. Cumulative cardiac dose was 
estimated by transferring dose from each cardiac phase onto a reference cine 
phase following deformable image registration. The LV was contoured on each 
4D-CT breathing phase and was called clinical LV (cLV); this structure is 
blurred by cardiac motion. Additionally, LV, LVM, and an American Heart 
Association (AHA) model were contoured on all cardiac phases. Relative 
maximum/mean doses for contoured regions were calculated with respect to each 
patient's maximum/mean AIP dose.
RESULTS: During respiration, relative maximum and mean doses on the cLV ranged 
from -4.5% to 5.6% and -14.2% to 16.5%, respectively, with significant 
differences in relative mean doses between inspiration and expiration 
(P < 0.0145). During cardiac motion at expiration, relative maximum and mean 
doses on the LV ranged from 1.6% to 59.3%, 0.5% to 27.4%, respectively. Relative 
mean doses were significantly different between diastole and systole 
(P = 0.0157). No significant differences were noted between systolic, diastolic, 
or cumulative cardiac doses compared to the expiratory 4D-CT (P > 0.14). 
Significant differences were observed in AHA segmental doses depending on tumour 
proximity compared to global LV doses on expiratory 4D-CT (P < 0.0117).
CONCLUSION: In this study, the LV dose was highest during expiration and 
diastole. Segmental evaluation suggested that future cardiotoxicity evaluations 
may benefit from regional assessments of dose that account for cardiopulmonary 
motion."
942,"INTRODUCTION: Significant controversy surrounds the ""Take the Volume Pledge"" 
campaign and the use of volume as a surrogate for quality. However, data on 
patient-reported attitudes toward this initiative are limited. We sought to 
examine patient preferences and perceptions regarding the location of their 
health care and the factors that may influence that decision.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After IRB approval, we conducted a prospective study at a 
109-bed tertiary referral military hospital, which performs 8 of the 10 defined 
high-risk low-volume surgeries. From 2018 to 2019, patients from all specialties 
completed anonymous questionnaires during preoperative registration. Univariate 
and multivariable analyses were performed to identify factors associated with 
patients desiring referral. Additional investigations into patient risk 
tolerance and thresholds regarding hospital/surgeon volume, postoperative 
complication risk, and cancer survival were analyzed.
RESULTS: Six hundred and three surveys were completed and available for 
analysis. Only 1.5% expressed a desire to seek care from a high-volume 
subspecialist. On multivariable analysis, the only independent predictors for 
patients desiring referral were perceived displeasure with their care (P = .02) 
and not being asked their opinion on where to have surgery (P = .04). Most 
patients (57.6%) expressed willingness to stay at their home institution even if 
only half of the recommended volume of surgeries are performed. Of patients, 
49.8% would accept a 10% increased risk of postoperative complications, and 
55.3% would accept decreased long-term cancer survival to stay at their home 
institution.
CONCLUSIONS: Only 1.5% of our population desired referral to a high-volume 
center. Our study showed that an open discussion and shared decision-making are 
the most important factors for patients when deciding where to have surgery. 
Moreover, most were willing to accept greater risk and lower volume to stay at 
their local hospital. Although performed at a single military facility, this 
study showed that patient preferences are extremely important and should not be 
understudied."
943,"BACKGROUND: Accurate staging and identification of optimal candidates for local 
salvage therapy, such as salvage radical prostatectomy (SRP), is necessary to 
ensure optimal care in patients with radiorecurrent prostate cancer (PCa). We 
aimed to analyze performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positron emission tomography 
(PET)/computed tomography (CT) for predicting pathologic nonorgan confined 
disease (pT3) and lymph node involvement (pN+) in patients treated with SRP for 
radiorecurrent PCa.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the institutional database to identify 
patients who underwent MRI or 68 Ga-PSMA-PET/CT before SRP for radiorecurrent 
PCa. The diagnostic estimates of MRI and PSMA-PET/CT for pT3 and pN+, were 
calculated.
RESULTS: We identified 113 patients with radiorecurrent PCa who underwent 
preoperative MRI followed by SRP; 53 had preoperative 68 Ga-PSMA-PET/CT. For the 
detection of pT3 disease, the overall accuracy of MRI was 70% (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 61-78), sensitivity 40% (95% CI 26-55) and specificity 94% (95% CI 
85-98); PSMA-PET/CT had slightly higher accuracy of 77% (95% CI 64-88), and 
higher sensitivity of 90% (95% CI 68-99), but lower specificity of 70% (95% CI 
51-84). For pN+ disease, MRI had poor sensitivity of 14% (95% CI 3-36), 
specificity of 50 (95% CI 39-61) and total accuracy of 43% (95% CI 34-53); 
PSMA-PET/CT had an accuracy of 85% (95% CI 72-93), sensitivity of 27% (95% CI 
6-61), and specificity of 100% (95% CI 92-100).
CONCLUSION: In patients with radiorecurrent PCa, both, MRI, and 68 Ga-PSMA 
PET/CT are valuable tools for the pre-SRP staging and should be integrated into 
the standard workup. For lymph node metastases, 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT is a strong 
rule-in test with nearly perfect specificity; in contrast MRI had a low accuracy 
for lymph node metastases."
944,"BACKGROUND: There is a considerable need to incorporate biomarkers of resistance 
to new antiandrogen agents in the management of castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (CRPC).
METHODS: We conducted a phase II trial of enzalutamide in first-line chemo-naïve 
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC and analyzed the prognostic value of 
TMPRSS2-ERG and other biomarkers, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), 
androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) in CTCs and plasma Androgen Receptor 
copy number gain (AR-gain). These biomarkers were correlated with treatment 
response and survival outcomes and developed a clinical-molecular prognostic 
model using penalized cox-proportional hazard model. This model was validated in 
an independent cohort.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were included. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene was 
detected in 32 patients with no differences observed in efficacy outcomes. CTC 
detection was associated with worse outcome and AR-V7 in CTCs was associated 
with increased rate of progression as best response. Plasma AR gain was strongly 
associated with an adverse outcome, with worse median prostate specific antigen 
(PSA)-PFS (4.2 vs. 14.7 m; p < 0.0001), rad-PFS (4.5 vs. 27.6 m; p < 0.0001), 
and OS (12.7 vs. 38.1 m; p < 0.0001). The clinical prognostic model developed in 
PREVAIL was validated (C-Index 0.70) and the addition of plasma AR (C-Index 
0.79; p < 0.001) increased its prognostic ability. We generated a parsimonious 
model including alkaline phosphatase (ALP); PSA and AR gain (C-index 0.78) that 
was validated in an independent cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: TMPRSS2-ERG detection did not correlate with differential activity 
of enzalutamide in first-line mCRPC. However, we observed that CTCs and plasma 
AR gain were the most relevant biomarkers."
945,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is associated with a high incidence of lung metastasis, which 
leads to a high risk of cancer death. Circular RNA (circRNA), a novel class of 
noncoding RNA, is emerging as a key player in human cancer. Herein, we explored 
the role of circMGEA5 in OS metastasis by conducting circRNA expression 
microarray. CircMGEA5 was significantly upregulated in metastatic OS tissues 
compared to primary tissues. High circMGEA5 was positively related with shorter 
overall and disease-free survival time. Knockdown of circMGEA5 suppressed OS 
cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). 
Mechanistically, circMGEA5 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to 
directly sponge miR-153-3p and miR-8084, resulting in increasing ZEB1 and Snail 
expression, respectively, thereby inducing EMT and metastasis. In turn, ZEB1 and 
Snail were capable to bind to circMGEA5 promoter, activating circMGEA5 
transcription, thus forming a positive feedback loop. Furthermore, we 
established the tail vein injection model and found that circMGEA5 depletion 
remarkably reduced lung metastasis nodules generated by OS cells. In sum, our 
findings, for the first time, reveal the metastasis-promoting role of circMGEA5 
in OS. Targeting of this newly identified ceRNA axis may be crucial in the 
development of novel therapies for metastatic OS patients."
946,"BACKGROUND: While radiation therapy (RT) is a critical component of breast 
cancer therapy and is known to decrease overall local recurrence rates, recent 
studies have shown that normal tissue radiation damage may increase recurrence 
risk. Fibrosis is a well-known consequence of RT, but the specific sequence of 
molecular and mechanical changes induced by RT remains poorly understood.
PURPOSE: To improve cancer therapy outcomes, there is a need to understand the 
role of the irradiated tissue microenvironment in tumor recurrence. This study 
seeks to evaluate the use of spectral quantitative ultrasound (spectral QUS) for 
real time determination of the normal tissue characteristic radiation response 
and to correlate these results to molecular features in irradiated tissues.
METHODS: Murine mammary fat pads (MFPs) were irradiated to 20 Gy, and spectral 
QUS was used to analyze tissue physical properties pre-irradiation as well as at 
1, 5, and 10 days post-irradiation. Tissues were processed for scanning electron 
microscopy imaging as well as histological and immunohistochemical staining to 
evaluate morphology and structure.
RESULTS: Tissue morphological and structural changes were observed 
non-invasively following radiation using mid-band fit (MBF), spectral slope 
(SS), and spectral intercept (SI) measurements obtained from spectral QUS. 
Statistically significant shifts in MBF and SI indicate structural tissue 
changes in real time, which matched histological observations. Radiation damage 
was indicated by increased adipose tissue density and extracellular matrix (ECM) 
deposition.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the potential of using spectral QUS to 
non-invasively evaluate normal tissue changes resulting from radiation damage. 
This supports further pre-clinical studies to determine how the tissue 
microenvironment and physical properties change in response to therapy, which 
may be important for improving treatment strategies. This article is protected

947,"Talimogene Laherparepvec (T-VEC) is a first in class oncolytic virotherapy 
approved for the treatment of unresectable melanoma recurrent after initial 
surgery. Biodistribution data from phase 2 study was used to develop a viral 
kinetics mechanistic model describing the interaction between cytokines like 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), immune system and 
T-VEC treatment. Our analysis found 1) viral infection rate has great influence 
on T-VEC treatment efficacy, 2) an increase of T-VEC dose of 102 pfu/mL 21 days 
and beyond after the initial dose of T-VEC resulted in a ~12% increase in 
response; and 3) at the systemic level the ratio of resting innate immune cells 
to the death rate of innate immune impact T-VEC treatment efficacy. This 
analysis clarifies under which condition the immune system either assists in 
eliminating tumor cells or inhibits T-VEC treatment efficacy which is critical 
to both efficiently design future oncolytic agents and understanding cancer 
development."
948,"This study aimed to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose and evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical 
activity of JNJ-63709178, a CD123/CD3 dual-targeting antibody, in patients with 
relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous 
(SC) administration of JNJ-63709178 were evaluated. IV infusions were 
administered once every two weeks (Cohorts 1-5 [n = 17]) or twice weekly 
(Cohorts 6-11 [n = 36]). A twice-weekly subcutaneous (SC) dosing regimen with 
step-up dosing was also studied (SC Cohorts 1-2 [n = 9]). Treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAE) ≥ Grade 3 were observed in 11 (65%) patients in Cohorts 
1-5 and 33 (92%) patients in Cohorts 6-11. At the highest IV dose (4.8 μg/kg), 5 
(71%) patients discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. For SC administration (n=9), 
8 (89%) patients experienced TEAEs ≥ Grade 3 and injection site reactions (≤ 
Grade 3) emerged in all patients. At 4.8 μg/kg (IV and SC), the mean maximum 
serum concentrations were 30.3 ng/mL and 3.59 ng/mL, respectively. Increases in 
multiple cytokines were observed following IV and SC administrations, and 
step-up dosing strategies did not mitigate cytokine production or improve the 
safety profile and led to limited duration of treatment. Minimal clinical 
activity was observed across all cohorts. IV and SC dosing of JNJ-63709178 was 
associated with suboptimal drug exposure, unfavorable safety profiles, limited 
clinical activity, and inability to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose."
949,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES) display a 
higher prevalence of smoking and have more difficulty quitting than higher SES

key risk (e.g., stress) and protective (self-efficacy) factors with smoking 
lapse varies by facets of SES.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational study using ecological momentary assessment to 
collect data for a 28-day period following a smoking quit attempt. Multilevel 
mixed models (i.e., generalized linear mixed models) examined cross-level 
interactions between lapse risk and protective factors and indicators of SES on 
smoking lapse.
PARTICIPANTS: A diverse sample of 330 adult U.S. smokers who completed a larger 
study examining the effects of race/ethnicity and social/environmental 
influences on smoking cessation.
MEASUREMENTS: Risk factors: momentary urge, negative affect, stress; Protective 
factors: positive affect, motivation, abstinence self-efficacy; SES measures: 
baseline measures of income and financial strain; Primary outcome: self-reported 
lapse.
FINDINGS: Participants provided 43,297 post-quit observations. Mixed models 
suggested that income and financial strain moderated the effect of some risk 
factors on smoking lapse. The within-person association of negative (odds ratio 
[OR] = 0.967, 95% [0.945, 0.990], p<.01) and positive affect (OR = 1.023, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] [1.003, 1.044], p<.05), and abstinence self-efficacy 
(OR = 1.020, 95% CI [1.003, 1.038], p<.05) on lapse varied with financial 
strain. The within-person association of negative affect (OR = 1.005, 95% CI 
[1.002, 1.008], p<.01), motivation (OR = 0.995, 95% CI [0.991, 0.999], p<.05), 
and abstinence self-efficacy (OR = 0.996, 95% CI [0.993, 0.999], p<.01) on lapse 
varied by income. The positive association of negative affect with lapse was 
stronger among individuals with higher income and lower financial strain. The 
negative association between positive affect and abstinence self-efficacy with 
lapse was stronger among individuals with lower financial strain, and the 
negative association between motivation and abstinence self-efficacy with lapse 
was stronger among those with higher income. The data were insensitive to detect 
statistically significant moderating effects of income and financial strain on 
the association of urge or stress with lapse.
CONCLUSION: Some risk factors (e.g. momentary negative affect) exert a weaker 
influence on smoking lapse among lower compared to higher socioeconomic status 
groups."
950,"Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and preventing susceptible 
patients from lethal infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly 
desirable but have proven to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a hybrid 
immunoactive nanosurface is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral 
immunity. A combination of checkpoint blocking antibody and virus-specific 
antigen is covalently conjugated to polydopamine nanoparticles, which can be 
anchored onto bacterial surface, by a one-step in-situ polymerization of 
dopamine under a cell-friendly condition. By virtue of the ability to colonize 
and penetrate deep tumor tissue, dressed bacteria enable sustained release and 
expanded exposure of carried immunoactivators to stimulate immune cells. In 
addition to a carrier role, bacteria are able to further provoke innate immunity 
due to native immunogenicity of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns. 
Immunization with dressed bacteria promote the maturation and activation of 
antigen-presenting cells, which induces robust humoral and cellular immune 
responses in tumor-bearing mice. As evidenced by efficient production of viral 
antigen-specific immunoglobulin G antibody in serum and significantly suppressed 
tumor growth in different models, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive 
nanosurface paves an avenue to prepare next-generation therapeutics for 
synergistic treatment and prevention. This article is protected by copyright.

951,"Oral mucositis is a serious issue in patients receiving oncological therapies. 
Mucosal protectants considered to be one of the preferred choices used in the 
management of mucositis. However, the protective efficacy of currently available 
mucosal protectants has been significantly compromised due to poor retention, 
lack of lubrication, poor biodegradability, and inability to manage secondary 
complications. Chitosan is a promising material for mucosal applications due to 
its beneficial biomedical properties. Chitosan is also anti-inflammatory, 
anti-microbial, and capable of scavenging free radicals, makes it a good 
candidate for the treatment of oral mucositis. Additionally, chitosan's amino 
polysaccharide skeleton permits a number of chemical alterations with better 
bioactive performance. This article provides a summary of key biological 
properties of chitosan and its derivatives that are useful for treating oral 
mucositis. Current literature evidence shows that Chitosan has superior mucosal 
protective properties when utilised alone or as delivery systems for 
co-encapsulated drugs."
952,"Background: An estimated 9.6 million people died from cancer globally in 2018, 
which is a reflection of the quality of patients' end-of-life care and its 
costs. Aim: To estimate direct medical costs of the last 30 days of oncology 
patients admitted to an inpatient clinic and to evaluate factors associated with 
medical costs at the end of life. Design: Cost-of-illness study with data from a 
retrospective cohort. Setting/Participants: We included patients aged 18 and 
older who were diagnosed with incurable cancer and who were admitted to a 
tertiary hospital in Brazil between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. 
Results: Our sample included 109 patients with an average age of 69 (61‒76). The 
median overall survival was 4.3 (.9‒12.9) months. The median cost per patient 
per day related to hospitalization was BRL 119 (73‒181)/United States dollars 
[USD] 21 (13‒33). The cost of medication was BRL 66 (40‒105)/USD 12 (7‒19), 
representing 55.46% of costs while that of materials and supplies was BRL 30 
(18‒49)/USD 5 (3‒9). In the multivariate analysis, when the limitation of 
interventions was recorded in the medical record, the median cost is reduced by 
BRL 50 (USD 9) per patient per day. Conclusions: The median cost per patient per 
day was BRL 119 (73‒181). The recording of limitations of therapeutic 
interventions in the medical record was a predictor variable that influenced the 
final medical cost of patients, suggesting that medical practice and 
decision-making in end-of-life care impact costs."
953,"BACKGROUND: The performance of uniportal VATS lobectomy (uVATS) for non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) larger than 5 cm is uncertain due to a lack of 
evidence. Here, we present a retrospective, propensity-score matched cohort 
study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of uVATS for patients with 
locally advanced NSCLC.
METHODS: The data of patients with NSCLC larger than 5 cm diameter who underwent 
curative resection via uVATS or thoracotomy lobectomy between January 2015 and 
December 2020 was collected. Propensity-score matching was utilized to control 
the observable biases.
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients underwent uVATS lobectomy, while 38 received 
thoracotomy lobectomy. No conversion to open surgery or perioperative death 
occurred. uVATS lobectomy achieved similar total lymph node dissection counts 
compared to thoracotomy and even yielded a higher amount of lymph node 
dissection in pTNM stage II patients. The long-term overall and recurrence-free 
survival rates were also similar between the two groups. Results from the 
propensity-score matching generated cohort agreed with those from the full 
cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: uVATS lobectomy is feasible and effective for curative lobectomy 
for NSCLC larger than 5 cm in diameter in selected patients. Further validations 
from well-designed prospective studies are required for uVATS lobectomy for 
patients with locally advanced NSCLC."
954,"Designing novel proteins to perform desired functions, such as binding or 
catalysis, is a major goal in synthetic biology. A variety of computational 
approaches can aid in this task. An energy-based framework rooted in the 
sequence-structure statistics of tertiary motifs (TERMs) can be used for 
sequence design on pre-defined backbones. Neural network models that use 
backbone coordinate-derived features provide another way to design new proteins. 
In this work, we combine the two methods to make neural structure-based models 
more suitable for protein design. Specifically, we supplement 
backbone-coordinate features with TERM-derived data, as inputs, and we generate 
energy functions as outputs. We present two architectures that generate Potts 
models over the sequence space: TERMinator, which uses both TERM-based and 
coordinate-based information, and COORDinator, which uses only coordinate-based 
information. Using these two models, we demonstrate that TERMs can be utilized 
to improve native sequence recovery performance of neural models. Furthermore, 
we demonstrate that sequences designed by TERMinator are predicted to fold to 
their target structures by AlphaFold. Finally, we show that both TERMinator and 
COORDinator learn notions of energetics, and these methods can be fine-tuned on 
experimental data to improve predictions. Our results suggest that using 
TERM-based and coordinate-based features together may be beneficial for protein 
design and that structure-based neural models that produce Potts energy tables 
have utility for flexible applications in protein science. This article is

955,"Post-prostatectomy Urinary incontinence (PPUI) due to open or robotic surgery 
has a negative impact on patients' psycho-social well-being and leads to altered 
quality of life (Kielb and Dunn in J Urol 166:958-61, 2001). Sphincteric 
incompetence overall remains the primary cause of PPUI, and it is believed that 
direct damage and manipulation intraoperatively could be the probable causes [1] 
(Bayoud et al. in Int J Urol 22:283-7-10, 2015). Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) 
rehabilitation appears to be beneficial in hastening the return of continence 
(Kampen and Poppel in Lancet 355:98-102, 2000). Hence, there is a need to 
re-educate or strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. To study the return of 
continence, and time duration required for the pelvic floor muscles to regain 
strength and endurance, thereby, leading to urinary continence and its effect on 
the quality of life of patients who have undergone robotic prostatectomy. Pelvic 
floor muscle grading, a 24 h pad test, and an International Prostate symptom 
scoring (IPSS) were the outcome measures used to assess the effect on 
incontinence status post-operatively. 69 patients were screened between a 
duration of 3 years, i.e., 2017-2020. Four patients remained incontinent 
3 months post-surgery. On the contrary, 65 patients regained continence. There 
is a definitive effect of early Kegel's exercise, the patient gains good pelvic 
floor muscle strength, portraying a reduction in dribbling or leakage of urine. 
Also, there is an improvement in the quality of life after Robotic Prostatectomy 
in Prostate cancer patients after 6 weeks of surgery. 94.20% of the patients 
have shown a have gained continence by 3 months post-robotic prostatectomy 
following a regular exercise regime of Kegel's exercise."
956,"Tumor therapeutic resistances are frequently linked to the recurrence and poor 
prognosis of cancers and have been a key bottleneck in clinical tumor treatment. 
Mucin1 (MUC1), a heterodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein, exhibits abnormally 
overexpression in a variety of human tumors and has been confirmed to be related 
to the formation of therapeutic resistance. In this review, the multifaceted 
roles of MUC1 in tumor therapy resistance are summarized from aspects of 
pan-cancer principles shared among therapies and individual mechanisms dependent 
on different therapies. Concretely, the common mechanisms of therapy resistance 
across cancers include interfering with gene expression, promoting genome 
instability, modifying tumor microenvironment, enhancing cancer heterogeneity 
and stemness, and activating evasion and metastasis. Moreover, the individual 
mechanisms of therapy resistance in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and biotherapy 
are introduced. Last but not least, MUC1-involved therapy resistance in 
different types of cancers and MUC1-related clinical trials are summarized."
957,"Bacterial L-asparaginase (LA) is a chemotherapeutic drug that has remained 
mainstay of cancer treatment for several decades. LA has been extensively used 
worldwide for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A 
halotolerant bacterial strain Bacillus licheniformis sp. isolated from marine 
environment was used for LA production. The enzyme produced was subjected to 
purification and physico-chemical characterisation. Purified LA was 
thermotolerant and demonstrated more than 90% enzyme activity after 1 h of 
incubation at 80 °C. LA has also proved to be resistant against pH gradient and 
retained activity at pH ranging from 3.0 to 10. The enzyme also had high 
salinity tolerance with 90% LA activity at 10% NaCl concentration. Detergents 
like Triton X-100 and Tween-80 were observed to inhibit LA activity while more 
than 70% catalytic activity was maintained in the presence of metals. 
Electrophoretic analysis revealed that LA is a heterodimer (~ 63 and ~ 65 kDa) 
and has molecular mass of around 130 kDa in native form. The kinetic parameters 
of LA were tested with LA having low Km value of 1.518 µM and Vmax value of 
6.94 µM/min/mL. Purified LA has also exhibited noteworthy antiproliferative 
activity against cancer cell lines-HeLa, SiHa, A549, and SH-SY-5Y. In addition, 
bench-scale LA production was conducted in a 5-L bioreactor using moringa leaves 
as cost-effective substrate."
958,"INTRODUCTION: Lymphopenia has been correlated with poorer survival in patients 
with metastatic cancers treated with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Treatments such as 
chemotherapy, surgery or radiotherapy can induce lymphopenia. Radiation-induced 
lymphopenia is common and prolonged in head and neck cancer (HNSCC) patients. We 
evaluated the impact of lymphopenia, on efficacy of anti PD-1 nivolumab 
immunotherapy in HNSCC patients.
METHODS: a multicenter retrospective study included consecutive patients treated 
with nivolumab for recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC between January 2017 and 
June 2019. Lymphopenia was defined as lymphocyte counts below 1000 cells/mm3 
upon initiation of nivolumab. Logistical regression was performed on factors 
associated with lymphopenia and ROC analyses assessed association between 
lymphopenia and survival.
RESULTS: median age was 65. Of the 100 included patients, 60% had been treated 
by surgery, 67% had had first-line chemotherapy, and 89% loco-regional 
radiotherapy, 65% had concurrent chemotherapy with radiotherapy. Lymphopenia 
occurred in 56 (56%) patients upon initiation of nivolumab, with 29 (29%) 
patients having radiation-related lymphopenia. Prior locoregional radiotherapy 
was the only factor associated with lymphopenia upon initiation of nivolumab by 
logistical regression (OR 0.144 [0.029-0.706], p - 0.017). Lymphopenia upon 
initiation of nivolumab did not affect progression-free survival (PFS) (p 
- 0.815), overall survival (OS) (p - 0.783) or disease control rate (DCR) (p 
- 0.125). Locoregional symptomatology (HR - 2.37 [1.24-4.54], p - 0.009), 
metastatic symptomatology (HR - 4.74 [2.21-10.15], and persistent lymphopenia 
under nivolumab (HR 3.96 [1.19-13.17] p - 0.034) were associated with poorer OS 
in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Lymphopenia upon initiation of nivolumab was not associated with 
poorer survival in R/M HNSCC patients, but persistence of lymphopenia during 
immunotherapy might be a prognostic marker of patient survival."
959,"Glomerular diseases afflict millions of people and impose an enormous burden on 
public healthcare costs worldwide. Identification of potential therapeutic 
targets for preventing glomerular diseases is of considerable clinical 
importance. CHILKBP is a focal adhesion protein and modulates a wide array of 
biological functions. However, little is known about the role of CHILKBP in 
glomerular diseases. To investigate the function of CHILKBP in maintaining the 
structure and function of podocytes in a physiologic setting, a mouse model 
(CHILKBP cKO) was generated in which CHILKBP gene was conditionally deleted in 
podocytes using the Cre-LoxP system. Ablation of CHILKBP in podocytes resulted 
in massive proteinuria and kidney failure in mice. Histologically, typical 
podocyte injury including podocyte loss, foot process effacement, and 
glomerulosclerosis was observed in CHILKBP cKO mice. Mechanistically, we 
identified ZO-1 as a key junctional protein that interacted with CHILKBP. Loss 
of CHILKBP in podocytes exhibited a significant reduction of ZO-1 expression, 
leading to abnormal actin organization, aberrant slit diaphragm protein 
expression and compromised podocyte filtration capacity. Restoration of CHILKBP 
or ZO-1 in CHILKBP-deficient podocytes effectively alleviated podocyte injury 
induced by the loss of CHILKBP in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we showed the 
glomerular expression of CHILKBP and ZO-1 was decreased in patients with 
proteinuric kidney diseases. Our findings reveal a novel signaling pathway 
consisting of CHILKBP and ZO-1 that plays an essential role in maintaining 
podocyte homeostasis and suggest novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate 
glomerular diseases."
960,"In recent years, there has been growing interest in SARM1 as a potential 
breakthrough drug target for treating various pathologies of axon degeneration. 
SARM1-mediated axon degeneration relies on its TIR domain NADase activity, but 
recent structural data suggest that the non-catalytic ARM domain could also 
serve as a pharmacological site as it has an allosteric inhibitory function. 
Here, we screened for synthetic small molecules that inhibit SARM1, and tested a 
selected set of these compounds in a DRG axon degeneration assay. Using cryo-EM, 
we found that one of the newly discovered inhibitors, a calmidazolium designated 
TK106, not only stabilizes the previously reported inhibited conformation of the 
octamer, but also a meta-stable structure: a duplex of octamers (16 protomers), 
which we have now determined to 4.0 Å resolution. In the duplex, each ARM domain 
protomer is engaged in lateral interactions with neighboring protomers, and is 
further stabilized by contralateral contacts with the opposing octamer ring. 
Mutagenesis of the duplex contact sites leads to a moderate increase in SARM1 
activation in cultured cells. Based on our data we propose that the duplex 
assembly constitutes an additional auto-inhibition mechanism that tightly 
prevents pre-mature activation and axon degeneration."
961,"Identification and classification of surrounding neck tissues are very important 
in thyroid surgery. The advantages of optical coherence tomography (OCT), high 
resolution, non-invasion, and non-destruction make it have great potential in 
identifying different neck tissues during thyroidectomy. We studied the 
automatic classification for neck tissues in OCT images based on convolutional 
neural network in this paper. OCT images of five kinds of neck tissues were 
collected firstly by our home-made swept source (SS-OCT) system, and a dataset 
was built for neural network training. Three image classification neural 
networks: LeNet, VGGNet, and ResNet, were used to train and test the dataset. 
The impact of transfer learning on the classification of neck tissue OCT images 
was also studied. Through the comparison of accuracy, it was found that ResNet 
has the best classification accuracy among the three networks. In addition, 
transfer learning did not significantly improve the accuracy, but it can 
somewhat accelerate the convergence of the network and shorten the network 
training time."
962,"PURPOSE: The main aim of this study was to investigate the long-term risk of 
disease recurrence in women treated for high-grade vaginal intraepithelial 
neoplasia (HG-VaIN).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis on a cohort of 82 women diagnosed 
with HG-VaIN between 2010 and 2021 at the ""Regional Referral Center for 
Prevention, Diagnosis and Treatment of HPV-related Genital Disorders"", 
Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. All 
women underwent either ablative treatment (CO2 laser ablation or 
electrocoagulation) or cold-knife excision.
RESULTS: In our series, the recurrence rate following treatment was 17%. The 
5-year cumulative probability of recurrence was 30.4% and the median time to 
recurrence was 15.5 months. None of the patients progressed to invasive vaginal 
cancer during follow-up. A concomitant cervical or vulvar intraepithelial lesion 
was significatively associated with an increased risk of recurrence (p = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that women with HG-VaIN are at 
high risk of developing disease recurrence after treatment, especially patients 
with a concomitant cervical or vulvar intraepithelial lesion. In these women 
strict monitoring is mandatory to obtain an early identification of recurrence."
963,"Histological artefacts in cryosectioned tissue can hinder rapid diagnostic 
assessments during surgery. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue 
provides higher quality slides, but the process for obtaining them is laborious 
(typically lasting 12-48 h) and hence unsuitable for intra-operative use. Here 
we report the development and performance of a deep-learning model that improves 
the quality of cryosectioned whole-slide images by transforming them into the 
style of whole-slide FFPE tissue within minutes. The model consists of a 
generative adversarial network incorporating an attention mechanism that 
rectifies cryosection artefacts and a self-regularization constraint between the 
cryosectioned and FFPE images for the preservation of clinically relevant 
features. Transformed FFPE-style images of gliomas and of non-small-cell lung 
cancers from a dataset independent from that used to train the model improved 
the rates of accurate tumour subtyping by pathologists."
964,"The effectivity of cancer immunotherapies is hindered by immunosuppressive 
tumour microenvironments that are poorly infiltrated by effector T cells and 
natural killer cells. In infection and autoimmune disease, the recruitment and 
activation of effector immune cells is coordinated by pro-inflammatory T helper 
17 (TH17) cells. Here we show that pathogen-mimicking hollow nanoparticles 
displaying mannan (a polysaccharide that activates TH17 cells in microbial cell 
walls) limit the fraction of regulatory T cells and induce TH17-cell-mediated 
anti-tumour responses. The nanoparticles activate the pattern-recognition 
receptor Dectin-2 and Toll-like receptor 4 in dendritic cells, and promote the 
differentiation of CD4+ T cells into the TH17 phenotype. In mice, intra-tumoural 
administration of the nanoparticles decreased the fraction of regulatory T cells 
in the tumour while markedly increasing the fractions of TH17 cells (and the 
levels of TH17-cell-associated cytokines), CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells 
and M1-like macrophages. The anti-tumoural activity of the effector cells was 
amplified by an agonistic antibody against the co-stimulatory receptor OX40 in 
multiple mouse models. Nanomaterials that induce TH17-cell-mediated immune 
responses may have therapeutic potential."
965,"In this study, we explored the pyroptosis-related biomarkers and signatures of 
colorectal cancer (CRC). Gene expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-COADREAD and were 
analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs in 
CRC‒pyroptosis-related genes (CRC‒PRGs) were obtained by intersecting DEGs 
associated with CRC and PRGs. The CRC‒PRGs were verified; functional enrichment 
analysis was performed with Gene Ontology (GO) followed by cluster analysis. Cox 
analyses and LASSO regression were used in TCGA dataset to construct a 
prognostic model for patients with CRC. A prognostic risk assessment model was 
constructed and efficacy was evaluated. Decision curve analysis was utilized to 
assess the role of the Lasso-Cox regression prognostic model for clinical 
utility at 1, 3, and 5 years. Twelve CRC‒PRGs were identified as prognostic 
pyroptosis-related DEGs. CXCL8, IL13RA2, MELK, and POP1 were selected as 
prognostic genes to construct features with a good prognostic performance in GEO 
and TCGA. Functional enrichment indicated that the 4-gene signature might be 
involved in CRC tumorigenesis and development through various pathways by 
playing a prognostic role in CRC. Furthermore, the results of the immune 
landscape analysis showed that the expression of CXCL8 and IL13RA2 in 
TCGA-COADREAD dataset was positively correlated with significant differential 
enrichment of most immune cells. A novel prognostic model consisting of four key 
genes, CXCL8, IL13RA2, MELK, and POP1, can accurately predict the survival of 
patients with CRC. This finding may provide a new perspective for the treatment 
of pyroptosis-related CRC."
966,"Cell-substrate adhesion nano-interfaces can, in principle, exhibit a spatial 
distribution of local pH values under the influence of the weakly acidic 
microenvironment of glycocalyx grafted on lipid bilayer cell membrane which is 
compressed and closely attached to culture substrate in the vicinity of 
integrin-adhesion complexes. However, a simple local pH distribution imaging 
methodology has not been developed. In this study, to visualize the local pH 
distribution at the cell adhesion interface, we prepared glass substrates 
chemically modified with a pH-responsive fluorescent dye fluorescein 
isothiocyanate (FITC), observed the distribution of FITC fluorescence intensity 
at the adhesion interface of fibroblast (NIH/3T3) and cancer cells (HeLa), and 
compared the FITC images with the observed distribution of focal adhesions. FITC 
images were converted to pH mapping based on the pH-fluorescence calibration 
data of surface-immobilized FITC pre-measured in different pH media, which 
showed significantly larger regions with lowered pH level (6.8-7.0) from outside 
the cell (pH 7.4) were observed at the thick inner periphery of HeLa cells while 
3T3 cells exhibited smaller lowered pH regions at the thin periphery. The 
lowered pH regions overlapped with many focal adhesions, and image analysis 
showed that larger focal adhesions tend to possess more lowered pH sites inside, 
reflecting enhanced glycocalyx compression due to accumulated integrin-adhesion 
ligand binding. This tendency was stronger for HeLa than for 3T3 cells. The role 
of glycocalyx compression and the pH reduction at the cell adhesive interface is 
discussed."
967,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: A potential solution to the deceased organ shortage is to 
include live organ donations and to identify patients with lower rates of HCC 
recurrence to fairly allocate liver grafts. Our aims were to detect the 
long-term outcomes of LDLT versus DDLT for HCC and predictors of recurrence 
after transplantation.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane library were searched for 
eligible studies from inception to July 2021 and a systematic review and 
meta-analysis were done.
RESULTS: 35 studies with a total of 7822 patients were included. The 1-, 3-, 
4 year-OS showed trivial improvement for LDLT recipients. However, the two 
modalities had similar 5-, 6- and 10-year OS. A significant improvement in the 
ITT-OS was observed for LDLT recipients. Regarding the DFS and recurrence after 
transplantation, no significant difference was observed between LDLT and DDLT. 
In addition to that, the pooled hazard ratio of the included studies showed that 
Milan criteria, level of AFP, presence of vascular invasion, tumor 
differentiation were significant predictors of recurrence.
CONCLUSION: The cancer biology (not the graft type) is the most important 
determinant of recurrence and survival after LT. However, LDLT provided much 
better survival benefits to HCC patients especially in regions that suffer from 
low deceased organ availability."
968,"BACKGROUND: The phase III ATTRACTION-3 study showed that second-line nivolumab 
monotherapy for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma prolonged overall 
survival (OS) but did not improve progression-free survival (PFS). Subsequent 
systemic therapy after discontinuing nivolumab may affect these outcomes. To 
test this possibility, we evaluated the outcomes of treatment with taxanes after 
nivolumab in ATTRACTION-3.
METHODS: We reviewed the charts of Japanese patients who had discontinued 
second-line nivolumab in ATTRACTION-3 and started subsequent third-line taxanes 
between January 7, 2016, and November 12, 2018. The primary endpoint was 
objective response rate (ORR) to third-line taxanes.
RESULTS: Of the 75 patients included in this study, 54 (72%), 18 (24%), and 3 
(4%) patients received either paclitaxel, docetaxel, or combination therapy 
comprising docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil, respectively. The ORR in 
the overall, paclitaxel, and docetaxel groups was 29.6%, 36.5%, and 12.5%, 
respectively; these numbers were comparable to those (20-44%) in patients 
receiving taxanes as first- and second-line therapy. The median OS in the 
overall, paclitaxel, and docetaxel groups was 9.9, 9.9, and 9.3 months, 
respectively, whereas the corresponding median PFS was 4.9, 4.7 and 6.5 months, 
respectively. Treatment-related adverse events were observed in 65 (87%) 
patients, of which grade 3-4 occurred in 37 (49%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Favorable effectiveness and safety profile of taxanes following 
second-line nivolumab was observed in Japanese patients with advanced esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma. When a patient with advanced esophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma receiving nivolumab becomes refractory or intolerant, subsequent 
taxane treatment may be a promising option."
969,"Our understanding of the function of the transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ 
(YAP/TAZ) in cancer is advancing. In this Review, we provide an update on recent 
progress in YAP/TAZ biology, their regulation by Hippo signaling and 
mechanotransduction and highlight open questions. YAP/TAZ signaling is an 
addiction shared by multiple tumor types and their microenvironments, providing 
many malignant attributes. As such, it represents an important vulnerability 
that may offer a broad window of therapeutic efficacy, and here we give an 
overview of the current treatment strategies and pioneering clinical trials."
970,"BACKGROUND: The Trichosporonaceae family comprises a large number of 
basidiomycetes widely distributed in nature. Some of its members, especially 
Trichosporon asahii, have the ability to cause human infections. This ability is 
related to a series of virulence factors, which include lytic enzymes 
production, biofilm formation, resistance to oxidizing agents, melanin and 
glucuronoxylomannan in the cell wall, metabolic plasticity and phenotypic 
switching. The last two are poorly addressed within human pathogenic 
Trichosporonaceae.
OBJECTIVE: These factors were herein studied to contribute with the knowledge of 
these emerging pathogens and to uncover mechanisms that would explain the higher 
frequency of T. asahii in human infections.
METHODS: We included 79 clinical isolates phenotypically identified as 
Trichosporon spp. and performed their molecular identification. Lactate and 
N-acetyl glucosamine were the carbon sources of metabolic plasticity studies. 
Morphologically altered colonies after subcultures and incubation at 37 °C 
indicated phenotypic switching.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The predominant species was T. asahii (n = 65), followed 
by Trichosporon inkin (n = 4), Apiotrichum montevideense (n = 3), Trichosporon 
japonicum (n = 2), Trichosporon faecale (n = 2), Cutaneotrichosporon 
debeurmannianum (n = 1), Trichosporon ovoides (n = 1), and Cutaneotrichosporon 
arboriforme (n = 1). T. asahii isolates had statistically higher growth on 
lactate and N-acetylglucosamine and on glucose during the first 72 hours of 
culture. T. asahii, T. inkin, and T. japonicum isolates were able to perform 
phenotypic switching. These results expand the virulence knowledge of 
Trichosporonaceae members and point for a role for metabolic plasticity and 
phenotypic switching on the trichosporonosis pathogenesis."
971,"Nuclear actin-based movements have been shown to orchestrate clustering of DNA 
double-strand breaks (DSBs) into homology-directed repair domains. Here we 
describe multiscale three-dimensional genome reorganization following DNA damage 
and analyze the contribution of the nuclear WASP-ARP2/3-actin pathway toward 
chromatin topology alterations and pathologic repair. Hi-C analysis reveals 
genome-wide, DNA damage-induced chromatin compartment flips facilitated by 
ARP2/3 that enrich for open, A compartments. Damage promotes interactions 
between DSBs, which in turn facilitate aberrant, actin-dependent intra- and 
inter-chromosomal rearrangements. Our work establishes that clustering of 
resected DSBs into repair domains by nuclear actin assembly is coordinated with 
multiscale alterations in genome architecture that enable homology-directed 
repair while also increasing nonhomologous end-joining-dependent translocation 
frequency."
972,"The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increased in non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), and defining at-risk patients is important. Thus, we aimed to 
assess the association between programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression 
and VTE [pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT)] in NSCLC. In 
this retrospective, observational multicentre study, 369 patients with NSCLC who 
had PD-L1 immunohistochemistry based on biopsies taken between January 2017 and 
December 2019, were divided as PD-L1-positive (n = 181) and -negative (n = 188) 
groups, and low-positive (n = 99) and high-positive (n = 82) PD-L1 groups. Among 
all population, 12.5% of them developed a VTE during a median follow-up of 
474 days. The rates of DVT, PE, and PE + DVT were 5.7%, 6% and 0.8%, 
respectively. VTE (15.5% vs. 9.5%) and DVT (3.8% vs. 7.4%) were similar between 
two groups, while PE was significantly higher in PD‑L1-positive group than those 
in PD-L1-negative group (11.1% vs 1%, p < 0.001). There were no significant 
differences between low- and high-positive groups in terms of VTE (14.1% vs. 
17%), PE (12.1% vs. 9.8%), and DVT (2% vs. 6.1%). In the multivariate analysis, 
multiple metastases (Hazard ratio [HR] 4.02; 95% confidence interval [Cl] 
1.18-13.63; p = 0.07) and PD-L1 positivity was associated with an increased PE 
risk (HR 8.39; 95% Cl 2.07-34.07; p = 0.003). In conclusion, PD-L1 positivity 
may be of important role in predicting the increased risk of PE in patients with 
NSCLC and thereby may be used to define patients likely to benefit from 
thromboprophylaxis."
973,"The incidence of well-differentiated non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumors (NF-PanNET) increased during the last decades. The risk of relapse after 
curative surgery, albeit low, is not negligible; moreover, adjuvant treatment is 
currently not an option and a reliable predictive model based on prognostic 
characteristics is urgently needed for tailoring a follow-up strategy. The 
histological classification of PanNET now relies only on the proliferative 
activity (mitosis and Ki67) and staging. In contrast to other endocrine 
neoplasms, the role of infiltrative growth pattern in NF-PanNET is not taken 
into consideration at present. In the current study, 247 consecutive patients 
who underwent surgical resection for a NF-PanNET were examined for the 
histological growth pattern of the tumor. Two distinct patterns 
(non-infiltrative vs. infiltrative) were described with the latter being further 
subclassified according to the type of structures invaded by the tumor 
(non-infiltrative: pattern 1; infiltration of adjacent pancreatic parenchyma 
and/or peripancreatic soft tissue: pattern 2; invasion of nearby organs and/or 
major vessels: pattern 3). The infiltrative growth resulted to be strongly 
associated with a poorer survival compared to a non-infiltrative growth 
(p < 0.001). In particular, the distinction between pancreatic parenchyma and/or 
peripancreatic soft tissue invasion versus adjacent organs and/or major vessels 
invasion was the most powerful predictor of recurrence after surgery at 
multivariate analysis (pattern 2 vs. pattern 1: HR 10.136, p = 0.028; pattern 3 
vs. pattern 1: HR 15.775, p = 0.015). The infiltrative growth pattern could 
therefore provide additional prognostic information implementing the current 
grading and staging system."
974,"BACKGROUND: While angioectasia is an important cause of acute hematochezia, 
relevant clinical features remain unclear. This study aims to reveal risk 
factors, clinical outcomes, and the effectiveness of therapeutic endoscopy for 
patients with acute hematochezia due to angioectasia.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at 49 Japanese hospitals 
between January 2010 and December 2019, enrolling patients hospitalized for 
acute hematochezia (CODE BLUE-J study). Baseline factors and clinical outcomes 
for angioectasia were analyzed.
RESULTS: Among 10,342 patients with acute hematochezia, 129 patients (1.2%) were 
diagnosed with angioectasia by colonoscopy. The following factors were 
significantly associated with angioectasia: chronic kidney disease, liver 
disease, female, body mass index < 25, and anticoagulant use. Patients with 
angioectasia were at a significant increased risk of blood transfusions compared 
to those without angioectasia (odds ratio [OR] 2.61; 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 1.69-4.02). Among patients with angioectasia, 36 patients (28%) experienced 
rebleeding during 1-year follow-up. The 1-year cumulative rebleeding rates were 
37.0% in the endoscopic clipping group, 14.3% in the coagulation group, and 
32.8% in the conservative management group. Compared to conservative management, 
coagulation therapy significantly reduced rebleeding risk (P = 0.038), while 
clipping did not (P = 0.81). Multivariate analysis showed coagulation therapy 
was an independent factor for reducing rebleeding risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.40; 
95% CI 0.16-0.96).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed patients with angioectasia had a greater 
comorbidity burden and needed more blood transfusions in comparison with those 
without angioectasia. To reduce rebleeding risk, coagulation therapy can be 
superior for controlling hematochezia secondary to angioectasia."
975,"PURPOSE: In oncology settings, music, especially music therapy (MT), is 
frequently used to improve patients' quality of life, pain situation, anxiety, 
depression, fatigue, and comfort. However, to date, there are no prospectively 
collected data correlating regular standardized MT sessions during radiotherapy 
(RT) to physical parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory 
rate, and oxygen saturation and corresponding quality of life measures using 
quantitative descriptive scales in oncological patients. Thus, the aim of this 
study was to investigate the effect of MT on the condition of radiooncology 
patients using these parameters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: During this study, patients participated weekly MT 
sessions guided by a board-certified music therapist. Data such as pain, 
physical comfort, and respiratory comfort based on the visual analogue scale 
(VAS) were collected before and after MT sessions. Furthermore, vital signs 
including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation as 
well as RT side effects were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 57 patients (age 61 ± 11 years) were enrolled in the study. 
Median VAS score was significantly different before and after MT for pain: VAS 1 
(interquartile range [IQR]: 0-3) vs. VAS 0 (IQR: 0-2; p < 0.001); physical 
comfort: VAS 7 (IQR: 6-7) vs. VAS 8 (IQR: 7-9; p < 0.001); and respiratory 
comfort only in the patients with pre-existing symptoms (VAS < 10 before 
therapy): VAS 8 (IQR: 6-8) vs. VAS 9 (IQR: 8-10; p = 0.002). Furthermore, vital 
signs were significantly reduced from pre-session to post-session (p > 0.001): 
heart rate 81 ± 14 min-1 to 76 ± 13 min-1 and respiratory rate from 12 ± 5 min-1 
to 10 ± 4 min-1. RT-related side effects did not interfere with participation in 
MT sessions.
CONCLUSION: In our study cohort of radiooncology patients, weekly MT sessions 
improved defined physical parameters as well as pain, physical comfort, and 
respiratory comfort. Establishing MT in the routine clinical setting should be 
more readily considered to further improve patient outcomes."
976,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PrCa) is one of the most hereditable human cancers, 
however, only a small fraction of patients has been shown to carry deleterious 
variants in known cancer predisposition genes.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed in multiple affected members of 45 
PrCa families to select the best candidate genes behind part of the PrCa missing 
hereditability. Recurrently mutated genes were prioritised, and further 
investigated by targeted next-generation sequencing in the whole early-onset 
and/or familial PrCa series of 462 patients.
RESULTS: PRUNE2 stood out from our analysis when also considering the available 
data on its association with PrCa development. Ten germline pathogenic/likely 
pathogenic variants in the PRUNE2 gene were identified in 13 patients. The most 
frequent variant was found in three unrelated patients and identical-by-descent 
analysis revealed that the haplotype associated with the variant is shared by 
all the variant carriers, supporting the existence of a common ancestor.
DISCUSSION: This is the first report of pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline 
variants in PRUNE2 in PrCa patients, namely in those with early-onset/familial 
disease. Importantly, PRUNE2 was the most frequently mutated gene in the whole 
series, with a deleterious germline variant identified in 2.8% of the patients, 
representing a novel prostate cancer predisposition gene."
977,"BACKGROUND: The OlympiA trial demonstrated the benefits of adjuvant usage of 
olaparib for high-risk patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-negative breast cancer (BC) and germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutation. This 
provoked thoughts on the clinical criteria of gBRCA testing. This study aims to 
estimate the costs and benefits of gBRCA testing and adjuvant olaparib therapy 
for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone-receptor 
(HR)-positive and HER2-negative BC in China and the United States of America 
(USA).
METHODS: We used a Markov chain decision tree analytic model to compare three 
gBRCA screening policies in China and the USA: (1) no gBRCA testing; (2) 
selected gBRCA testing and (3) universal gBRCA testing for nonmetastatic TNBC 
and HR-positive HER2-negative BC patients. We modelled the benefit of systemic 
therapy and risk-reducing surgeries among patients identified with pathogenic or 
likely pathogenic variants (PVs) in BRCA1 and BRCA2.
RESULTS: Changing from the selected gBRCA testing to the universal gBRCA testing 
in TNBC patients is cost-effective, with the incremental cost-effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) being 10991.1 and 56518.2 USD/QALY in China and the USA, 
respectively. Expanding universal gBRCA testing to HR-positive HER2-negative BC 
and TNBC patients has ICERs of 2023.3 and 16611.1 USD/QALY in China and the USA, 
respectively.
DISCUSSION: By performing gBRCA testing on all HER2-negative BC patients, 
adjuvant olaparib can be offered to high-risk patients with a PV in BRCA1 or 
BRCA2. These patients are also candidates for risk-reducing surgeries, an 
important aspect of their survivorship care, and these interventions can improve 
survival outcomes. With the willingness-to-pay thresholds being 31,500.0 and 
100,000.0 USD per QALY gained in China and the USA, respectively, universal 
gBRCA testing is likely cost-effective for all HER2-negative BC patients. This 
simplified criterion of gBRCA testing for BC is recommended for adoption by 
current guidelines in China and the USA."
978,"Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are considered crucial in anti-tumour 
immunity. Accordingly, the presence of TILs contains prognostic and predictive 
value. In 2011, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the 
prognostic value of TILs across cancer types. Since then, the advent of immune 
checkpoint blockade (ICB) has renewed interest in the analysis of TILs. In this 
review, we first describe how our understanding of the prognostic value of TIL 
has changed over the last decade. New insights on novel TIL subsets are 
discussed and give a broader view on the prognostic effect of TILs in cancer. 
Apart from prognostic value, evidence on the predictive significance of TILs in 
the immune therapy era are discussed, as well as new techniques, such as machine 
learning that strive to incorporate these predictive capacities within clinical 
trials."
979,"In this perspective, the authors summarise some properties of the solid tumour 
micro-environment that have been explored during the last 55 years. It is well 
established that the concentrations of nutrients, including oxygen, decrease 
with increasing distance from tumour blood vessels, and that low extracellular 
pH is found in nutrient-poor regions. Cell proliferation is dependent on 
nutrient metabolites and decreases in regions distal from patent blood vessels. 
Proliferating cells cause migration of neighbouring cells further from blood 
vessels where they may die, and their breakdown products pass into regions of 
necrosis. Anticancer drugs reach solid tumours via the vascular system and 
establish concentration gradients such that drug concentration within tumours 
may be quite variable. Treatment with chemotherapy such as doxorubicin or 
docetaxel can kill well-nourished proliferating cells close to blood vessels, 
thereby interrupting migration toward necrotic regions and lead to 
re-oxygenation and renewed proliferation of distal cells, as can occur with 
radiotherapy. This effect leads to the paradox that cancer treatment can rescue 
cells that were destined to die in the untreated tumour. Renewed and sometimes 
accelerated repopulation of surviving tumour cells can counter the effects of 
cell killing from repeated treatments, leading to tumour shrinkage and regrowth 
without changes in the intrinsic sensitivity of cells to the administered 
treatment. Strategies to prevent these effects include the combined use of 
chemotherapy with agents that selectively kill hypoxic tumour cells, including 
inhibitors of autophagy, since this is a process that may allow recycling of 
cellular macromolecules from dying cells and improve their survival."
980,"Patients (pts) with polycythemia vera (PV) suffer from pruritus, night sweats, 
and other symptoms, as well as from thromboembolic complications and progression 
to post-PV myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib (RUX) is approved for second-line therapy 
in high-risk PV pts with hydroxyurea intolerance or resistance. The RuxoBEAT 
trial (NCT02577926, registered on October 1, 2015, at clinicaltrials.gov) is a 
multicenter, open-label, two-arm phase-IIb trial with a target population of 380 
pts with PV or ET, randomized to receive RUX or best available therapy. This 
pre-specified futility analysis assesses the early clinical benefit and 
tolerability of RUX in previously untreated PV pts (6-week cytoreduction was 
allowed). Twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to receive RUX. Compared 
to baseline, after 6 months of treatment, there was a significant reduction of 
median hematocrit (46 to 41%), the median number of phlebotomies per year (4.0 
to 0), and median patient-reported pruritus scores (2 to 1), and a trend for 
reduced night sweat scores (1.5 to 0). JAK2V617F allele burden, as part of the 
scientific research program, also significantly decreased. One hundred nine 
adverse events (AEs) occurred in 24/28 patients (all grade 1 to 3), and no pt 
permanently discontinued treatment because of AEs. Thus, treatment with 
ruxolitinib in untreated PV pts is feasible, well-tolerated, and efficient 
regarding the above-mentioned endpoints."
981,"Royal jelly is a gelatinous nutrient secretion produced by the mandibular glands 
of young worker honey bees and has a critical role in honey bee life. In the 
honey bee colonies, queen and worker honey bees have very different morphologies 
and behaviors due to their diet in the larval period, despite having the same 
genome. In comparison, queen bees formed from larvae that feed royal jelly 
exclusively, and worker bees formed from larvae that feed on much less royal 
jelly. DNA methylation has been shown to play a critical role in the development 
of queen and worker honeybees. Alterations in DNA methylation, one of the 
epigenetic mechanisms defined as hereditable nucleotide modifications that occur 
in gene expression without changes in the DNA sequence, are closely related to 
many diseases, especially cancer. Hypermethylation of CpG islands located in the 
promoter regions of genes causes gene silencing and tumor suppressor genes 
epigenetically have silenced in cancer. The inactivation of tumor suppressor 
genes disrupts nearly all cellular pathways in cancer. In contrast to genetic 
alterations, gene silencing by epigenetic modifications may potentially be 
reversed and used in cancer treatment. Royal jelly, which causes epigenetic 
changes in bee colonies, has the potential to cause a change in cancer cells. In 
our study, royal jelly's effects on DNA methyltransferase enzyme and gene 
methylation of RASSF1A tumor suppressor were investigated in human cancer cell 
lines (HeLa, HT29, and A549), and modifications in the gene expression profile 
of royal jelly were determined by next generation sequencing."
982,"PURPOSE: Non-communicable diseases generate the largest number of avoidable 
deaths often caused by risk factors such as alcohol, smoking, and unhealthy 
diets. Our study investigates the association between amount and context of 
alcohol consumption and mortality from major non-communicable diseases in 
Switzerland.
METHODS: Generalized linear regression models were fitted on data of the 
cross-sectional population-based National Nutrition Survey menuCH (2014-2015, 
n = 2057). Mortality rates based on the Swiss mortality data (2015-2018) were 
modeled by the alcohol consumption group considering the amount and context 
(i.e., during or outside mealtime) of alcohol consumption and potential 
confounders. The models were checked for spatial autocorrelation using Moran's I 
statistic. Integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) models were fitted 
when evidence for missing spatial information was found.
RESULTS: Higher mortality rates were detected among drinkers compared to 
non-drinkers for all-cancer (rate ratio (RR) ranging from 1.01 to 1.07) and 
upper aero-digestive tract cancer (RR ranging from 1.15 to 1.20) mortality. 
Global Moran's I statistic revealed spatial autocorrelation at the Swiss 
district level for all-cancer mortality. An INLA model led to the identification 
of three districts with a significant decrease and four districts with a 
significant increase in all-cancer mortality.
CONCLUSION: Significant associations of alcohol consumption with all-cancer and 
upper aero-digestive tract cancer mortality were detected. Our study results 
indicate the need for further studies to improve the next alcohol-prevention 
scheme and to lower the number of avoidable deaths in Switzerland."
983,"PURPOSE: Mastocheck®, a proteomic-based blood assay, has been developed for 
early diagnosis of breast cancer. The purpose of this study is whether 
Mastocheck® is useful as a postoperative follow-up.
METHODS: A total of 255 patients were analyzed. The patients were classified 
into longitudinal monitoring and recurrence/nonrecurrence cohorts. The 
longitudinal monitoring cohort consisted of 111 patients. In this cohort, blood 
analyses were performed three times (before surgery, 8 weeks after surgery, and 
between 6 months and one year after surgery), and a comparative analysis of the 
values of Mastocheck® and individual proteins at each time point was performed. 
The recurrence/nonrecurrence cohort consisted of 144 patients who had been 
followed up for more than 1 year, and the blood marker values at the time of 
local recurrence were compared to those of nonrecurrence patients.
RESULTS: In the longitudinal monitoring cohort analysis, in 81 of 111 patients 
were diagnosed with breast cancer with Mastocheck® and the sensitivity was 
73.0%. Of 111 patients in the longitudinal monitoring cohort, 108 had two blood 
analyses (before and 8 weeks after surgery), and three serial blood analyses 
were performed on 53 patients. The Mastocheck® value that were in the cancer 
range of 73.0% (in 81 of 111 patients) of patients before surgery, was within 
the normal range of 68.5% (in 74 of 108 patients) at 8 weeks after surgery and 
88.7% (in 47 of 53 patients) from 6 months to 1 year after surgery. The value of 
Mastocheck® was significantly decreased after surgery compared to before surgery 
(p < 0.001). In the recurrence/nonrecurrence cohort analysis, the Mastocheck® 
values were in the cancer range in 38 out of 63 recurrence patients and within 
the normal range in 66 of 81 nonrecurrence patients (sensitivity of 60.3% and 
specificity of 80.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Mastocheck® is expected to be used as a blood marker tool to aid in 
the early detection of recurrence during follow-up after breast cancer surgery."
984,"INTRODUCTION: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a form of 
adoptive cell therapy that has demonstrated tremendous results in the treatment 
of hematopoietic malignancies, leading to the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) approval of four CD19-targeted CAR-T cell products. With the unprecedented 
success of CAR-T cell therapy in hematological malignancies, hundreds of 
preclinical studies and clinical trials are currently undergoing to explore the 
translation of this treatment to solid tumors. However, the clinical experience 
in non-hematologic malignancies has been less encouraging, with only a few 
patients achieving complete responses. Tumor-associated antigen heterogeneity, 
inefficient CAR-T cell trafficking and the immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironment are considered as the most pivotal roadblocks in solid tumor 
CAR-T cell therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the relevant literature/clinical trials for 
CAR-T cell immunotherapy for solid tumors from Pubmed and ClinicalTrials.gov.
CONCLUSION: Herein, we provide an update on solid tumor CAR-T cell clinical 
trials, focusing on the studies with published results. We further discuss some 
of the key hurdles that CAR-T cell therapy is encountering for solid tumor 
treatment as well as the strategies that are exploited to overcome these 
obstacles."
985,"Veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS) is a 
potentially life-threatening complication of haematopoietic cell transplantation 
(HCT) conditioning. The DEFIFrance post-marketing registry study evaluated 
effectiveness and safety in patients who received defibrotide. It collected 
retrospective/prospective patient data from 53 French HCT centres from July 2014 
to March 2020. Primary endpoints were survival and complete response (CR; total 
serum bilirubin <2 mg/dL, multiorgan failure resolution) at Day 100 post-HCT 
among patients with severe/very severe VOD/SOS. A secondary endpoint was 
evaluation of treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) of interest. Of 
798 patients analysed, 251 and 81 received defibrotide treatment for severe/very 
severe VOD/SOS and mild/moderate VOD/SOS post-HCT, respectively; 381 received 
defibrotide for VOD/SOS prophylaxis. In patients with severe/very severe VOD/SOS 
post-HCT, Kaplan-Meier-estimated CR at Day 100 was 74% (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 66%, 81%). At Day 100, 137/251 (55%) were alive and in CR. 
Kaplan-Meier-estimated Day 100 post-HCT survival was 61% (95% CI: 55%, 67%) in 
patients with severe/very severe VOD/SOS. TESAEs of interest occurred in 29% of 
these patients; VOD/SOS-related mortality at 12 months was 15%. DEFIFrance 
represents the largest collection of real-world data on post-registration 
defibrotide use, supporting the real-world utility of defibrotide for patients 
with severe/very severe VOD/SOS post-HCT."
986,"The essential roles of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as a scaffold 
protein in DNA replication and repair are well established, while its cytosolic 
roles are less explored. Two metabolic enzymes, alpha-enolase (ENO1) and 
6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), both contain PCNA interacting motifs. 
Mutation of the PCNA interacting motif APIM in ENO1 (F423A) impaired its binding 
to PCNA and resulted in reduced cellular levels of ENO1 protein, reduced growth 
rate, reduced glucose consumption, and reduced activation of AKT. Metabolome and 
signalome analysis reveal large consequences of impairing the direct interaction 
between PCNA and ENO1. Metabolites above ENO1 in glycolysis accumulated while 
lower glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolite pools decreased in the APIM-mutated 
cells; however, their overall energetic status were similar to parental cells. 
Treating haematological cancer cells or activated primary monocytes with a PCNA 
targeting peptide drug containing APIM (ATX-101) also lead to a metabolic shift 
characterized by reduced glycolytic rate. In addition, we show that ATX-101 
treatments reduced the ENO1 - PCNA interaction, the ENO1, GAPDH and 6PGD protein 
levels, as well as the 6PGD activity. Here we report for the first time that 
PCNA acts as a scaffold for metabolic enzymes, and thereby act as a direct 
regulator of primary metabolism."
987,"Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) is a highly conserved protein 
essential for DNA replication, repair and scaffold functions in the cytosol. 
Specific inhibition of PCNA in cancer cells is an attractive anti-cancer 
strategy. ATX-101 is a first-in-class drug targeting PCNA, primarily in cellular 
stress regulation. Multiple in vivo and in vitro investigations demonstrated 
anti-cancer activity of ATX-101 in many tumor types and a potentiating effect on 
the activity of anti-cancer therapies. Healthy cells were less affected. Based 
on preclinical data, a clinical phase 1 study was initiated. Twenty-five 
patients with progressive, late-stage solid tumors were treated with weekly 
ATX-101 infusions at four dose levels (20, 30, 45, 60 mg/m2). ATX-101 showed a 
favorable safety profile supporting that vital cellular functions are not 
compromised in healthy cells. Mild and moderate infusion-related reactions were 
observed in 64% of patients. ATX-101 was quickly cleared from blood with 
elimination half-lives of less than 30 min at all dose levels, probably due to 
both, a quick cell penetration and peptide digestion in serum, as demonstrated 
in vivo. No tumor responses were observed but stable disease was seen in 70% of 
the efficacy population (n = 20). Further studies have been initiated to provide 
evidence of efficacy. Trial registration numbers: ANZCTR 375262 and ANZCTR 
375319."
988,"The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rising worldwide. Here, we 
identified SCNN1B as an outlier down-regulated in CRC and it functions as a 
tumor suppressor. SCNN1B mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated in 
primary CRC and CRC cells. In a tissue microarray cohort (N = 153), SCNN1B 
protein was an independent prognostic factor for favorable outcomes in CRC. 
Ectopic expression of SCNN1B in CRC cell lines suppressed cell proliferation, 
induced apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, and suppressed cell migration in 
vitro. Xenograft models validated tumor suppressive function of SCNN1B in vivo. 
Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that SCNN1B 
correlates with KRAS signaling. Consistently, MAPK qPCR and kinase arrays 
revealed that SCNN1B suppressed MAPK signaling. In particular, SCNN1B 
overexpression suppressed p-MEK/p-ERK expression and SRE-mediated transcription 
activities, confirming blockade of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. Mechanistically, 
SCNN1B did not affect KRAS activation, instead impairing activation of c-Raf by 
inducing its inhibitory phosphorylation and targeting active c-Raf for 
degradation. The ectopic expression of c-Raf fully rescued cell proliferation 
and colony formation in SCNN1B-overexpressing CRC cells, confirming c-Raf as the 
principal molecular target of SCNN1B. In summary, we identified SCNN1B as a 
tumor suppressor by functioning as a c-Raf antagonist, which in turn suppressed 
oncogenic MEK-ERK signaling."
989,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) results in rapid fluctuation of 
testosterone (T) between near-castrate and supraphysiological levels and has 
shown promise in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Its 
clinical effects may be mediated through induction of DNA damage, and 
preclinical studies suggest synergy with PARP inhibitors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, Phase II trial testing olaparib 
plus BAT (T cypionate/enanthate 400 mg every 28 days) with ongoing androgen 
deprivation. Planned recruitment was 30 subjects (equal proportions with/without 
homologous recombination repair [HRR] gene mutations) with mCRPC post 
abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. The primary objective was to determine PSA50 
response (PSA decline ≥50% from baseline) rate at 12-weeks. The primary analysis 
utilized the entire (intent-to-treat [ITT]) cohort, with those dropping out 
early counted as non-responders. Secondary/exploratory analyses were in those 
treated beyond 12-weeks (response-evaluable cohort).
RESULTS: Thirty-six patients enrolled and 6 discontinued prior to response 
assessment. In the ITT cohort, PSA50 response rate at 12-weeks was 11/36 (31%; 
95% CI 17-48%), and 16/36 (44%, 95% CI 28-62%) had a PSA50 response at any time 
on-study. After a median follow-up of 19 months, the median 
clinical/radiographic progression-free survival in the ITT cohort was 13.0 
months (95% CI 7-17). Clinical outcomes were similar regardless of HRR gene 
mutational status.
CONCLUSIONS: BAT plus olaparib is associated with high response rates and long 
PFS. Clinical benefit was observed regardless of HRR gene mutational status."
990,"The current report describes the chemical investigation and biological activity 
of extracts produced by three fungal strains Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium 
simplicissimum, and Fusarium proliferatum isolated from the roots of Piper 
nigrum L. growing in Vietnam. These fungi were namely determined by 
morphological and DNA analyses. GC-MS identification revealed that the EtOAc 
extracts of these fungi were associated with the presence of saturated and 
unsaturated fatty acids. These EtOAc extracts showed cytotoxicity towards cancer 
cell line HepG2, inhibited various microbacterial organisms, especially fungus 
Aspergillus niger and yeast Candida albicans (the MIC values of 50-100 µg/mL). 
In α-glucosidase inhibitory assay, they induced the IC50 values of 1.00-2.53 
µg/mL were better than positive control acarbose (169.80 µg/mL). The EtOAc 
extract of F. oxysporum also showed strong anti-inflammatory activity against NO 
production and PGE-2 level. Four major compounds linoleic acid (37.346%), oleic 
acid (27.520%), palmitic acid (25.547%), and stearic acid (7.030%) from the 
EtOAc extract of F. oxysporum were selective in molecular docking study, by 
which linoleic and oleic acids showed higher binding affinity towards 
α-glucosidase than palmitic and stearic acids. In subsequent docking assay with 
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), palmitic acid, oleic acid and linoleic 
acid could be moderate inhibitors."
991,"BACKGROUND: The use of thyroglobulin concentration in washout fluid of 
fine-needle aspiration (FNA-Tg) is a procedure advocated by international 
guidelines to diagnose metastatic LN in papillary thyroid cancer. With the 
increasing use of active follow-up or lobectomy alone for low-risk thyroid 
cancers, the determination of the diagnostic performance of FNA-Tg in the 
detection of metastatic PTC when the thyroid is in situ is paramount.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective study with measurement of Tg in washout fluid 
obtained from intraoperative fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology in order to 
avoid contamination from thyroid tissue and rigorously isolated punctured nodes. 
Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC), 
optimal threshold to discriminate benign and malignant LN, sensitivity and 
specificity were provided.
RESULTS: a total of 58 lymph nodes from 32 patients were analyzed. ROC analysis 
defined the optimal cutoff values of FNA-Tg at 60 ng/ml for the diagnosis of 
malignant LNs in patients with a thyroid in situ. Sensitivity and specificity 
were 75% (95% confidence interval 57.89-86.75) and 87.5% (95%CI: 69-95.66), 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our results support the hypothesis that the Tg-FNA threshold for a 
safe diagnosis of LN metastasis in PTC is higher in presence of a thyroid gland 
in situ. The use of lower thresholds could result in false positive results and 
lead to unnecessary surgery."
992,"BACKGROUND: Salvage transplant has been historically considered effective 
therapy for myeloma patients relapsing after first transplant, if they achieved 
adequate remission duration. However, the efficacy of novel agent combinations 
has called this paradigm into question.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis in a homogeneously 
treated cohort of 106 patients undergoing ASCT2 at our institution, all of whom 
received novel agent-based chemotherapy (immunomodulatory agent [IMiD] and/or 
proteasome inhibitor [PI]) for both induction and relapse. As an exploratory 
objective we assessed whether predictive thresholds of progression free survival 
post first transplant (ASCT1) for benefit post ASCT2 vary with use of IMiD 
maintenance post ASCT1.
RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR) was 98% post-ASCT2 and 
treatment-related mortality (TRM) was low at 1.8%. With a median follow-up of 26 
months (range 0.5-85) from ASCT2, median overall survival (OS) is estimated at 
80 months (95% CI: ≥ 49-months) and median progression-free survival after ASCT2 
(PFS2) at 24 months (95% CI 19-39). PFS post first transplant (PFS1) at >/= 50 
months was associated with improved OS. Predictors of PFS2 included PFS1 ≤42 
months and progression on IMiD-based maintenance post- ASCT1.
CONCLUSION: ASCT2 continues to offer acceptable outcomes for most patients 
treated within modern day treatment paradigms, with longer PFS after ASCT1 and 
IMiD non-refractory disease being associated with improved outcomes."
993,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are standard of care in advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, not all patients benefit, even 
among PD-L1 tumor proportional score (TPS) ≥50%, indicating an unmet need for 
additional biomarkers such as those assessing the tumor immune microenvironment 
(TIME). DetermaIO is a 27-gene assay that classifies TIME and has previously 
demonstrated association with ICI response.
METHODS: FFPE samples were selected from BC Cancer and West Clinic Cancer Center 
patients with performance status (PS) ≤2 who received at least 2 cycles of ICI 
monotherapy in the first (1L) or second line (2L). IO scores were generated and 
analyzed for association with PFS and OS.
RESULTS: In the entire cohort (N=147), IO score was significantly associated 
with OS (HR=0.68, 95%CI 0.47-0.99, P = .042) and PFS (HR=0.62, 95%CI 0.43-0.88, 
P = .0069). In 1L treated patients (PD-L1≥50%, N=78), IO score was significantly 
associated with PFS (HR=0.55, 95%CI 0.32-0.94, P = .028). In exploratory 
analyses, IO score was associated with benefit in 1L PS2 patients for OS 
(HR = 0.26, 95%CI 0.091-0.74, P = .012) and PFS (HR = 0.27, 95%CI 0.098-0.72, 
P = .0095) which was confirmed in PFS subgroup analysis in the independent West 
Cancer Center study (N=13 HR=0.14, 95%CI 0.027-0.76, P = .023).
CONCLUSION: These data confirm the association of DetermaIO with ICI clinical 
benefit in NSCLC, and expand on previous studies by demonstrating that first 
line treated PD-L1≥50% patients can further be stratified by IO score to 
identify efficacy. Exploratory analysis suggested that the IO score identifies 
benefit in patients with poor PS."
994,"BACKGROUND: We sought to provide a meta-analysis and credibility assessment of 
available randomized controlled trials and propensity score matched studies when 
assessing early and oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy 
compared with open distal pancreatectomy.
METHODS: The MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were 
searched for pertinent literature up to June 2022. Random-effect meta-analyses 
were applied. Trial sequential analysis was applied to verify whether results 
were true- or false-positive or -negative findings.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies were identified (2 randomized controlled trials and 11 
propensity score matched studies). The early outcomes were assessed on 12 
studies, including 4,346 patients. In this population, laparoscopic distal 
pancreatectomy decreased postoperative stay (mean difference = 1.8 days; P = 
.001) and estimated blood loss (mean difference = 148 mL; P = .001), and trial 
sequential analysis confirmed these as true-positive findings. Laparoscopic 
distal pancreatectomy and open distal pancreatectomy had similar operating times 
(P = .165), and trial sequential analysis confirmed this as a true-negative 
finding. Major morbidity, mortality, and readmission were similar, but results 
were inconclusive by trial sequential analysis. Oncologic outcomes were assessed 
on 5 studies, including 2,430 patients. In this population, laparoscopic distal 
pancreatectomy showed higher R0 resection rate (OR = 1.46; P = .001) and shorter 
time to adjuvant therapy (mean difference 4.0 days P = .003). A survival benefit 
was observed at 1 year after laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (OR = 1.45; P = 
.001), which was not confirmed at 3 years (P = .650).
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is superior to open distal 
pancreatectomy for most of the early outcomes analyzed. The operating time was 
equalized as a result of the learning curve. Results from patients with 
pancreatic cancer suggest at least an oncologic noninferiority of laparoscopic 
distal pancreatectomy compared with open distal pancreatectomy."
995,"BACKGROUND: Here we present updated survival of the CAIRO2 trial and assessed 
whether the addition of anti-EGFR to anti-VEGF therapy could still be an 
effective treatment option for patients with extended RAS/BRAF wildtype and 
left-sided metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective updated survival and extended RAS and BRAF 
V600E mutational analysis were performed in the CAIRO2 trial, a multicenter, 
randomized phase III trial on the effect of adding cetuximab to a combination of 
capecitabine, oxaliplatin (CAPOX), and bevacizumab in mCRC.
RESULTS: Updated survival analysis confirmed that the addition of cetuximab did 
not provide a benefit on either progression free (PFS) or overall survival (OS) 
in the intention-to-treat population. With the extended mutational analyses 31 
KRAS, 31 NRAS and 12 BRAF V600E additional mutations were found. No benefit of 
the addition of cetuximab was observed within the extended wildtype group, even 
when selecting only left-sided tumors (PFS HR 0.96, p = 0.7775). However, 
compared to the original trial an increase of 6.5 months was seen for patients 
with both extended wildtype and left-sided tumors (median OS 28.6 months).
CONCLUSION: Adding cetuximab to CAPOX and bevacizumab does not provide clinical 
benefit in patients with mCRC, even in the extended wildtype group with 
left-sided tumors. However, in the extended wildtype group we did observe 
clinically relevant higher survival compared to the initial trial report, 
indicating that it is important to analyze a broader panel of RAS and BRAF 
variants using more recent sequencing techniques when assessing survival benefit 
after anti-EGFR therapy."
996,"BACKGROUND: Increasing studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) have great 
diagnostic value in cancer. Axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) is closely 
related to the prognosis of breast cancer. However, it remains unknown whether 
miRNAs in whole blood could be promising biomarkers in breast cancer ALNM.
METHODS: An miRNA microarray was used to screen potential differentially 
expressed miRNA candidates in whole blood of three breast cancer patients with 
ALNM and three without ALNM. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) was used to detect candidate differentially expressed miRNAs in the 
whole blood of 109 breast cancer patients. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis 
was carried to predict the potential targets and enriched pathway of miRNAs.
RESULTS: QRT-PCR validated the fact that miR-367-3p, miR-548aq-5p and miR-4710 
are downregulated in breast cancer with ALNM compared to it without ALNM. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that miR-367-3p, 
miR-548aq-5p and miR-4710 have good diagnostic values. Notably, the three-miRNA 
signature showed better predictive value, with an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 
0.7414. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the miRNAs could participate in a 
complex network and thus be involved in cancer-related pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the potential of miR-367-3p, miR-548aq-5p and 
miR-4710 and the three-miRNA signature as biomarkers for breast cancer with 
ALNM."
997,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to assess the clinical outcome of 
isolated lymph node recurrence in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer 
treated by surgery and to analyze the impact of various clinico-pathological 
factors on prognosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all the 
epithelial ovarian cancer patients who underwent secondary lymphadenectomy 
surgery for isolated lymph node recurrence at our institute from 2013 to 2020. 
Univariate analysis of various factors influencing the post-recurrence disease 
free survival and post-recurrence survival was done using Kaplan-Meier for 
categorical variables and cox-proportional hazard progression for continuous 
variables.
RESULTS: A total of 21 patients of isolated lymph node recurrence were treated 
surgically during the study period. The median disease free interval to develop 
lymph nodal recurrence was 13 months. All the patients achieved complete 
resection to no gross residual disease without any significant morbidity 
associated with the procedure. The median post-recurrence disease free survival 
after treatment of lymph node recurrence was 25 months with 3-year 
post-recurrence survival of 72% and 3-year overall survival of 85%. Amongst the 
factors influencing post-recurrence disease free survival, young age (< 50 
years), para-aortic lymph node dissection at initial surgery and single site of 
lymph node recurrence were significantly associated with better prognosis. A 
single site of lymph node recurrence was associated with significantly better 
post-recurrence survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Complete resection is feasible for epithelial ovarian cancer 
patients presenting with isolated lymph node recurrence, without any significant 
perioperative morbidity. When combined with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, 
complete resection is associated with favourable survival outcomes. Young age, 
para-aortic lymph node dissection during primary surgery and single site of 
lymph node recurrence are associated with better prognosis."
998,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to test whether the current practice of using mpMRI stage 
might lead to a Will Rogers phenomenon with a stage migration compared to DRE in 
men undergoing radical prostatectomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 572 consecutive patients who underwent radical 
prostatectomy at a single institution (2007-2017) were included. Clinical stage 
using digital rectal examination was determined on table by the operating 
surgeon; mpMRI and pathological stage were recorded after tumor board review. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as no rising PSA, no 
adjuvant/salvage treatment, and no metastases or mortality. PFS was compared 
between groups and a model incorporating mpMRI into the EAU risk groups was 
created.
RESULTS: Median age was 63 years (IQR 58.5-67) and median PSA was 8.9 ng/ml (IQR 
6.5-13.2). Using DRE stage, 20% were NCCN low risk, 43% were intermediate, and 
37% high. Median follow-up was 48 months (IQR 22-73). Estimated PFS at 1, 3, and 
5 years was 75%, 59%, and 54%, respectively. When comparing PFS between DRE and 
mpMRI stages, patients deemed T1 (P < 0.01) or T3 (P = 0.03) by mpMRI showed 
better outcomes than patients staged T1 or T3 by DRE. On univariable analysis 
lower risk for failure was seen for MRI T1 disease (HR 0.10 95%, CI 0.01-0.73, 
P = 0.02) or MRI T3 (HR 0.70, CI 0.51-0.97, P = 0.03). On multivariable 
analysis, only MRI T1 remained a significant predictor (HR 0.08, 95% CI 
0.01-0.59, P = 0.01). The subsequent, modified EAU risk model using both DRE and 
mpMRI performed significantly better than the DRE model.
CONCLUSION: PFS based on mpMRI is not the same as DRE staging. Current risk 
groups which use DRE should be used with caution in whom local stage is based on 
mpMRI. Our modified EAU-risk categories can provide greater accuracy."
999,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is defined as skeletal muscle loss and can 
be assessed by cross-sectional imaging. Our aim was to establish the effect of 
sarcopenia on relevant outcomes in patients with pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in curative and palliative settings based on a large 
patient sample.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: MEDLINE library, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases were 
screened for the associations between sarcopenia and mortality in patients with 
PDAC up to March 2022. The primary endpoint of the systematic review was the 
hazard ratio of Sarcopenia on survival. 22 studies were included into the 
present analysis.
RESULTS: The included 22 studies comprised 3958 patients. The prevalence of 
sarcopenia was 38.7%. Sarcopenia was associated with a higher prevalence in the 
palliative setting (OR 53.23, CI 39.00-67.45, p<0.001) compared to the curative 
setting (OR 36.73, CI 27.81-45.65, p<0.001). Sarcopenia was associated with 
worse OS in the univariable (HR 1.79, CI 1.41-2.28, p<0.001) and multivariable 
analysis (HR 1.62, CI 1.27-2.07, p<0.001) in the curative setting. For the 
palliative setting the pooled hazards ratio showed that sarcopenia was 
associated with overall survival (HR 1.56, CI 1.21-2.02, p<0.001) as well as in 
multivariable analysis (HR 1.77, CI 1.39-2.26, p<0.001). Sarcopenia was not 
associated with a higher rate of post-operative complications in univariable 
analysis (OR 1.10, CI 0.70-1.72, p = 0.69).
CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia occurs in 38.7% of patients with pancreatic cancer, 
significantly more in the palliative setting. Sarcopenia is associated with 
overall survival in both settings. The assessment of sarcopenia is therefore 
relevant for personalized oncology. Sarcopenia is not associated with 
postoperative complications."
1000,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of dynamic contrast-enhanced 
magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)-based radiomics at baseline and after two 
cycles of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and associated longitudinal changes for 
early prediction of the NAT response in patients with breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred seventeen patients with breast cancer who 
underwent DCE-MRI before NAT and after two cycles of NAT from April 2019 to 
November 2021 were enrolled retrospectively. Patients were randomly divided into 
a training set (n = 81) and a test set (n = 36) at a ratio of 7:3. 
Clinical-pathological data and the relative tumor maximum diameter regression 
value (diameter%) were also collected. A total of 851 radiomic features were 
extracted from the phase with the most pronounced tumor enhancement on DCE-MRI 
T1 imaging acquired both pre- and post-treatment. Delta and delta% radiomics 
features were also calculated. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection 
Operator (LASSO) method was applied to select features, and a logistic 
regression model was used to calculate pre-NAT, early-NAT, delta, and delta% 
radscores and then select among four radscores to build a Fusion radiomics 
model. The final clinical-radiomics model was constructed by combining fusion 
radscores and clinical-pathological variables. The discrimination and clinical 
utility of the models were further evaluated and compared.
RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) values of the fusion radiomics model 
based on pre-NAT, Delta, and Delta% radscores were 0.868 of 0.825. The 
clinical-radiomics model integrating Fusion radscores and clinical-pathological 
variables achieved AUC values of 0.920 of 0.884, which were higher than those of 
the clinical model constructed by AUC values (0.858/0.831), although no 
significant improvement was observed in the test set (Delong test, p = 0.196). 
Decision curve analysis (DCA) showed that the clinical-radiomics model 
demonstrated more clinical utility than the clinical model.
CONCLUSION: DCE-MRI-based radiomics features may have potential for pathological 
complete response (pCR) prediction in the early phase of NAT. By combining 
radiomics features and clinical-pathological characteristics, higher diagnostic 
performance can be achieved."
1001,"BACKGROUND: Research describing male breast cancer with HER2 overexpression is 
limited. This study evaluated the characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of 
HER2 positive breast cancer in men.
METHODS: Information for January 2010 through December 2017 was obtained from 
the SEER Research Plus database.
RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-two men were HER2 positive (13%) of 3594 cases of 
breast cancer. Compared to HER2 negative patients, these patients were younger 
at diagnosis (63 vs. 67 years, p < 0.001), had more poorly differentiated cancer 
(Grade III 53% vs. 33%, p < 0.001), and larger tumor size (28.8 vs. 24.6 mm, 
p < 0.001). HER2 positive males also had distant site and/or contralateral lymph 
node involvement more often (13% vs. 7%, p < 0.001), had higher rate of 
cancer-related mortality (15% vs. 10%, p = 0.002), and shorter overall survival 
(34 vs. 38 months, p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Men diagnosed with HER2 positive breast cancer had more advanced 
disease at diagnosis and worse outcomes than HER2 negative men despite increased 
utilization of systemic therapy."
1002,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We aim to adapt the International Consortium for 
Health Outcomes Measurements standard set for chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
patients to the Spanish setting and supplement it with those variables agreed 
upon through initiatives proposed by the Spanish Society of Nephrologists 
(S.E.N.).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The working group defined a first standard set of 
variables based on a literature review. The S.E.N. members then assessed the 
suitability of each variable for inclusion (Consensus≥75%). A second draft of 
the standard set was generated and evaluated by the Patient advocacy group 
Federación Nacional de Asociaciones para la Lucha Contra las Enfermedades del 
Riñón (ALCER). Lastly, the working group established the final standard set of 
variables (Consensus≥75%).
RESULTS: The standard set targets patients with very high-risk CKD (G3a/A3 and 
G3b/A2-G5) in pre-end-stage kidney disease (pre-ESKD), hemodialysis (HD), 
peritoneal dialysis (PD), kidney transplantation (KT) or conservative care (CC). 
The essential follow-up variables agreed for all patients (All) were patient 
survival, hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, smoking status, 
health-related quality of life, pain, fatigue, physical function, daily 
activities, depression, renal function and hemoglobin. Additionally, it was 
agreed to collect PD survival (in PD patients), peritonitis (PD), 
infection/bacteremia (PD, HD, KT), vascular access type (HD), vascular access 
survival (HD), acute rejection (KT), post-transplant cancer (KT), albuminuria 
(KT) and kidney allograft survival (KT). The optional variables agreed were 
phosphorus (All), potassium (All), diabetes control (All with diabetes), and 
albuminuria (pre-ESKD).
CONCLUSIONS: This standard set may constitute a highly efficient tool allowing 
the evaluation of patient outcomes and helping to define strategies to enhance 
CKD patients' quality of care in the Spanish healthcare system."
1003,"lncRNAs play a crucial role in the carcinogenesis process. Thus, they have been 
recognized as the potential therapeutic and diagnostic biomarkers of cancers. 
This study assessed the alteration in the expression of APOC1P1-3 lncRNA in 
cancerous tissues compared to their adjacent non-tumorous tissues sampled from 
cervical cancer patients. one hundred fifteen pairs of cancerous and adjacent 
non-cancerous biopsy of cervical cancer specimens were collected. RNA isolation 
and cDNA synthesis were carried out. The qRT-PCR was used to assess the changes 
in the expression of APOC1P1-3 lncRNA. Moreover, the biomarker function of the 
lncRNA and the correlations between APOC1P1-3 and clinicopathological parameters 
were measured. The APOC1P1-3 expression was significantly increased in cervical 
cancer specimens as compared to adjacent non-tumorous specimens (p < 0.0001). A 
significant association was also observed between APOC1P1-3 expression and lymph 
node involvement (p = 0.031). Additionally, APOC1P1-3 expression demonstrated a 
significant association with the depth of tumor invasion (p = 0.035), and 
squamous type of cervical cancer (p = 0.019). The overexpression of APOC1P1-3 
was significantly observed in patients younger than 50 years old as compared to 
another age group (p = 0.033). The results of ROC curve exhibited that APOC1P1-3 
with area under the curve (AUC), specificity, and sensitivity of 0.96, 93.91%, 
and 78.26%, respectively can be considered as a potential biomarker. Regarding 
overexpression of APOC1P1-3 in human cervical cancer samples, this lncRNA may be 
considered as an oncogenic factor in cervical cancer patients. Besides, 
APOC1P1-3 may be a possible biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of 
cervical cancer patients."
1004,"OBJECTIVE: To assess accuracy of whole slide imaging (WSI) in the interpretation 
of permanent and frozen sections in surgical pathology and the identification of 
tumors in cutaneous en face frozen sections.
METHODS: Twenty glass slides containing cutaneous en face frozen sections were 
selected from twenty cases of keratinocyte carcinomas treated with Mohs 
micrographic surgery. Ten slides contained tumor and ten did not. A blinded 
dermatologic surgeon used traditional light microscopy (LM) to assess physical 
slides for tumor presence and type, while noting the confidence (scale 1-10) and 
time (min) in making the determination. After a seven-day washout period, the 
surgeon repeated this process using WSI of the same slides, each de-identified 
and scanned at 20x using the Aperio AT2 (Leica Biosystems).
RESULTS: Percent agreement between LM and WSI was 100%, with Cohen's kappa of 
1.0. The average time taken to determine tumor presence was significantly 
greater using WSI than LM. Similarly, the surgeon was significantly more 
confident using LM than WSI.
CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study suggests that diagnostic concordance is 
excellent between LM and WSI in the evaluation of Mohs frozen sections. However, 
WSI was cumbersome to use, not ergonomic, and required significantly more time."
1005,"Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is quite 
uncommon and generally presents with GI bleeding, abdominal pain, and 
obstruction. However, presentation of CLL as discrete masses without GI symptoms 
is very rare. A notable complication for patients with CLL is infection due to 
immunological dysregulation and is typically caused by encapsulated bacteria 
involving the respiratory tract while viral infections often happen post 
treatment. Here we present a 78-years-old female with history of treatment-naïve 
CLL who was incidentally found to have discrete colonic masses secondary to CLL, 
as well as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections 
during endoscopic studies for colostomy reversal. On follow-up computed 
tomography, she was found to have pulmonary amyloidosis as well. We recommend 
that gastrointestinal tract evaluation should be a part of the complete 
assessment of the treatment response and remission status in CLL patients to 
permit early and appropriate therapeutic intervention."
1006,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify new biomarkers for ovarian cancer 
screening based on bioinformatics analysis and q-PCR validation.
METHODS: In total, five independent ovarian cancer patient cohorts were included 
to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Thereafter, Gene Ontology 
(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were 
employed to clarify the functions of DEGs. The selected DEGs were screened by 
STRING database and Cytoscape software to obtain hub genes. Additionally, 
univariate Cox hazard analysis revealed the relevance between hub genes and 
patient survival. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to 
determine the accuracy of hub genes in discriminating ovarian cancer. Finally, 
q-PCR analysis was conducted to validate hub gene expression in ovarian cancer 
tissues.
RESULTS: From gene expression profiles of five GEO datasets, 85 common 
up-regulated and 64 common down-regulated DEGs were identified. Moreover, the 
up-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in mitosis related biological processes 
while the down-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in amino acid metabolisms. In 
hub genes analysis, 10 and 9 hub genes, respectively, were obtained from 
up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs. High expression of hub gene FGF13 was 
confirmed to be significantly related to a better ovarian cancer survival. The 
selected hub genes, except for FGF13, showed high accuracy in the discrimination 
of ovarian cancer. According to q-PCR validation in ovarian cancer tissues, 
CDC20, CCNB1, BUB1B, KIF20A, BRIC5, CAV1, MEIS2, and CFH were finally considered 
as the potential diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: FGF13 is a potential prognostic biomarker for predicting patient 
survival outcome. In addition, CDC20, CCNB1, BUB1B, KIF20A, BIRC5, CAV1, MEIS2, 
and CFH are the potential biomarkers for ovarian cancer discrimination."
1007,"OBJECTIVE: Shc SH2 domain-binding protein (SHCBP1) is involved in regulating 
tumour progression in a variety of tumour types. The aim of this study was to 
analyze the prognostic landscape of SHCBP1 in pan-cancer and investigate the 
relationship between SHCBP1 expression and tumour immune microenvironment.
METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and genotype tissue expression (GTEx) 
database were used for obtaining the required data for the evaluation of SHCBP1 
expression. The clinical characteristics and prognostic role of SHCBP1 were 
analyzed by using TCGA cohort. This was followed by gene set enrichment analysis 
by R software. Based on TCGA pan-cancer data, the correlation between SHCBP1 
expression and immune infiltration, immune-related genes, microsatellite 
instability (MSI), and tumour mutational burden (TMB) was discussed. Finally, 
the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 192 anti-cancer drugs 
were obtained from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database 
and their correlation with SHCBP1 was analyzed.
RESULTS: SHCBP1 was upregulated in most tumours showing a significant 
association with poor prognosis. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed SHCBP1 
relation to the immunity, cell cycle, and cancer pathway in various types of 
tumour. SHCBP1 expression also showed a positive correlation with 
tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and immunosuppressive genes including 
TGFBR1, PD-L1 and TGFB1 and so on. In addition, high expression of SHCBP1 in 
patients was associated with resistance to a variety of anti-tumour drugs.
CONCLUSION: The present study confirms SHCBP1 as a poor prognostic marker of 
cancers. Its high expression is suggested to be involved in immunological 
resistance to a variety of anti-tumour drugs."
1008,"OBJECTIVE: The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) colorectal neoplasia differentially 
expressed (CRNDE) is considered a carcinogenic promoter in various human 
malignancies. However, the role and underlying mechanism of action of CRNDE 
during carcinogenesis in neuroblastoma remain unknown.
METHODS: CRNDE transcript levels were detected in neuroblastoma tissues and 
adjacent normal tissues. The effects of CRNDE overexpression and knockdown on 
the viability of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS cells were determined using the Cell 
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Flow cytometry was performed to measure the role 
of CRNDE in apoptosis and the cell cycle in neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, the 
transwell assay was used to evaluate the role of CRNDE in the migration and 
invasion of tumor cells. The levels of ERK/MAPK pathway-related proteins were 
evaluated using western blotting. The in vivo role of CRNDE in tumor growth and 
apoptosis was evaluated in a xenograft mouse model of human neuroblastoma.
RESULTS: The relative expression of CRNDE was significantly higher in 
neuroblastoma tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, knockdown 
of CRNDE inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell cycle 
arrest, whereas elevation of CRNDE promoted cell growth and inhibited apoptosis 
in neuroblastoma cells. In addition, depletion of CRNDE suppressed migration and 
invasion, whereas overexpression of CRNDE enhanced the migratory and invasive 
potential of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS cells. At the mechanistic level, western 
blotting showed that CRNDE exerted its oncogenic role by affecting the ERK/MAPK 
signaling pathway. Furthermore, animal experiments confirmed that CRNDE promotes 
tumor growth and inhibits apoptosis in neuroblastoma in vivo.
CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that CRNDE plays a critical role in the 
proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of neuroblastoma by altering 
the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, representing a novel molecular target for the 
treatment of neuroblastoma."
1009,"OBJECTIVE: Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers are the most often 
diagnosed subtype of breast tumors, in which the development of tamoxifen 
resistance remains a major impediment. The effect of long non-coding RNA 
(lncRNA) on therapy resistance is beginning to emerge. The lncRNA 91H, a 
recently identified lncRNA involved in tumorigenesis, is also overexpressed in 
breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of 91H in the 
biological function and tamoxifen resistance of ER+ breast cancer cells.
METHODS: MCF-7 and T47D cells were transfected for 91H silence. CCK-8 assay was 
performed to examine cell viability and drug sensitivity. Cell cycle and 
apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. Cell migration capacity was 
determined by wound healing assay. The protein level was analyzed by Western 
blotting.
RESULTS: MCF-7 and T47D cells with 91H knockdown exhibited lower capacities of 
cell proliferation and migration. In addition, knockdown of 91H resulted in 
significantly increased sensitivity to tamoxifen and a higher ratio of apoptosis 
induced by tamoxifen. Furthermore, the protein level of p-mTOR was notably 
inhibited through downregulating 91H expression. And the mTOR inhibitor together 
with tamoxifen presented synergistic effect on the inhibition of cell viability.
CONCLUSION: Our study highlights that 91H might serve as a potential target for 
ER+ breast cancer patients who have acquired tamoxifen resistance."
1010,"Children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA) with relapsed/refractory 
classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) without complete metabolic response (CMR) 
before autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) have poor 
survival outcomes. CheckMate 744, a phase 2 study for CAYA (aged 5-30 years) 
with relapsed/refractory cHL, evaluated a risk-stratified, response-adapted 
approach with nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin (BV) followed by BV plus 
bendamustine for patients with suboptimal response. Risk stratification was 
primarily based on time to relapse, prior treatment, and presence of B symptoms. 
We present the primary analysis of the standard-risk cohort. Data from the 
low-risk cohort are reported separately. Patients received 4 induction cycles 
with nivolumab plus BV; those without CMR (Deauville score >3, Lugano 2014) 
received BV plus bendamustine intensification. Patients with CMR after induction 
or intensification proceeded to consolidation (high-dose chemotherapy/auto-HCT 
per protocol). Primary endpoint was CMR any time before consolidation. 
Forty-four patients were treated. Median age was 16 years. At a minimum 
follow-up of 15.6 months, 43 patients received 4 induction cycles (1 
discontinued); 11 of whom received intensification, 32 proceeded to 
consolidation. CMR rate was 59% after induction with nivolumab plus BV, and 94% 
any time before consolidation (nivolumab plus BV ± BV plus bendamustine). 
One-year PFS rate was 91%. During induction, 18% of patients experienced grade 
3/4 treatment-related adverse events. This risk-stratified, response-adapted 
salvage strategy had high CMR rates with limited toxicities in CAYA with 
relapsed/refractory cHL. Most patients did not require additional chemotherapy 
(bendamustine intensification). Additional follow-up is needed to confirm 
durability of disease control. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02927769."
1011,"Prediction of individual patient benefit from lenalidomide (Len) maintenance 
post autologous transplant (ASCT) remains challenging. We investigated here 
extended molecular profiling for outcome prediction in NCRI Myeloma XI (MyXI) 
trial patients. MyXI patients randomized to Len maintenance or observation 
post-ASCT were genetically profiled for t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), del(1p), 
gain(1q) and del(17p) and co-occurrence of risk markers computed. PFS, PFS2 and 
OS were calculated from maintenance randomization, and groups compared using Cox 
proportional hazards regression. 556 MyXI patients, 17% with double hit MM (≥2 
risk markers), 32% with single hit (1 risk marker) and 51% without risk marker, 
were analyzed. Single hit MM derived the highest PFS benefit from Len 
maintenance, specifically isolated del(1p), del(17p) and t(4;14), with 
approximately 40-fold (HR 0.02; 95% CI: 0.002-0.24; P=0.0012), 10-fold (HR 0.1; 
95% CI: 0.02-0.58; P=0.0095) and 7-fold (HR 0.14; 95% CI: 0.04-0.45; P=0.0009) 
reduced risk of progression or death (PFS) compared to observation, 
respectively. This benefit translated into improved PFS2 HR 0.27 (95% CI: 
0.13-0.54; P=0.0002) and OS HR 0.41 (95% CI: 0.18-0.93; P=0.03) for this group 
of patients over observation; median PFS was 10.9 vs. 57.3 months for 
observation vs. Len maintenance. Patients with isolated gain(1q) derived no 
benefit, and double hit MM limited benefit, regardless or risk lesions involved, 
from Len maintenance. Extended genetic profiling identifies patients deriving 
exceptional benefit from Len maintenance and should be considered for newly 
diagnosed patients to support management discussions along their treatment 
pathway."
1012,"In response to tissue injury, within seconds the ultra large glycoprotein, von 
Willebrand factor (VWF) is released from endothelial storage organelles 
(Weibel-Palade bodies) into the lumen of the blood vasculature where it leads to 
the recruitment of platelets. The marked size of VWF multimers represents an 
unprecedented burden on the secretory machinery of endothelial cells (ECs). ECs 
have evolved mechanisms to overcome this, most notably an actomyosin ring, that 
forms, contracts and squeezes out its unwieldy cargo. Inhibiting the formation 
or function of these structures represents a novel therapeutic target for 
thrombotic pathologies though characterising proteins associated with such a 
dynamic process has been challenging. We have combined APEX-2 proximity 
labelling with an innovative dual loss of function screen to identify proteins 
associated with actomyosin ring function. We show p21 activated kinase 2 (PAK2) 
recruits septin hetero-oligomers, a molecular interaction that forms a ring 
around exocytic sites. This cascade of events control actomyosin ring function 
aiding efficient exocytic release. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PAK2 
or septins led to inefficient release of VWF and a failure to form 
platelet-catching strings. This new molecular mechanism offers additional 
therapeutic targets for the control of thrombotic disease and is highly relevant 
to other secretory systems that employ exocytic actomyosin machinery."
1013,"BACKGROUND: The associations between body flexibility and sarcopenia were not 
well understood. This study aimed to explore the cross-sectional and 
longitudinal associations of flexibility with sarcopenia.
METHODS: Our study selected participants aged 50-80 from the WELL-China cohort 
and the Lanxi cohort. Participants from the urban area of the Lanxi cohort were 
followed up 4 years later. Body flexibility was measured by the sit-and-reach 
test. Muscle mass was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Muscle 
strength was evaluated using handgrip strength. Sarcopenia was defined as having 
both low muscle mass and low muscle strength. We used multivariable logistic 
regressions to assess the cross-sectional associations of body flexibility with 
low muscle mass, low muscle strength and sarcopenia. We also used multivariable 
logistic regressions to explore the associations of baseline flexibility and 
4-year changes in flexibility with incident low muscle mass, low muscle strength 
and sarcopenia.
RESULTS: A total of 9453 participants were enrolled in the cross-sectional 
study, and 1233 participants were included in the longitudinal analyses. In the 
cross-sectional analyses, compared with low body flexibility, high body 
flexibility was inversely associated with low muscle mass (odds ratio [OR], 
0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.68; P < 0.001), low muscle strength 
(OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.55-0.69; P < 0.001) and sarcopenia (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 
0.41-0.65; P < 0.001), and these associations did not differ in different age 
groups, sex or physical activity levels. In the longitudinal analyses, compared 
with participants with low body flexibility, participants with high body 
flexibility had lower risk of the incident low muscle strength (OR, 0.53; 95% 
CI, 0.38-0.74; P < 0.001) and sarcopenia (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.21-0.61; 
P < 0.001), but not incident low muscle mass (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.33-1.06; 
P = 0.076). Every 1-cm increase in flexibility during 4 years was associated 
with reduced risk of incident low muscle mass (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00; 
P = 0.025), low muscle strength (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.98; P = 0.002) and 
sarcopenia (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99; P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: High flexibility was associated with reduced risk of incident low 
muscle strength and sarcopenia. Increases in flexibility were associated with 
reduced risk of incident low muscle mass, low muscle strength and sarcopenia. 
Flexibility exercises and monitoring the dynamic change of flexibility might be 
helpful in preventing sarcopenia among adults aged 50 years or over."
1014,"Nearly 14% of disease-causing germline variants result from disruption of mRNA 
splicing. Most (67%) DNA variants predicted in silico to disrupt splicing end up 
classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). We developed and 
validated an analytic workflow - Splice Effect Event Resolver (SPEER) - that 
uses mRNA sequencing to reveal significant deviations in splicing, pinpoints the 
DNA variants potentially responsible, and measures the deleterious effect of the 
altered splicing on mRNA transcripts, providing evidence to assess the 
pathogenicity of the variant. SPEER was used to analyze leukocyte RNA encoding 
63 hereditary cancer syndrome genes in 20,317 individuals undergoing clinical 
genetic testing. Among 3,563 (17.5%) individuals with at least one DNA variant 
predicted to affect splicing, 971 (4.8%) had altered splicing with a deleterious 
effect on the transcript and 40 had altered splicing due to a DNA variant 
located outside our laboratory's reportable range. Integrating SPEER results 
into variant interpretation allowed reclassification of VUS to P/LP in 0.4% and 
to B/LB in 5.9% of the 20,317 patients. SPEER evidence had a significantly 
higher impact for P/LP and B/LB classifications in non-White individuals 
compared to non-Hispanic White individuals, illustrating that evidence derived 
from RNA splicing analysis may help reduce ethnic/ancestral disparities in 
genetic testing."
1015,"PURPOSE: To evaluate a software simulating perfused liver volume from virtual 
selected embolization points on proximal enhanced cone-beam CT (CBCT) liver 
angiography data set by using selective CBCT as reference standard.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight selective/proximal CBCT couples in 46 
patients referred for intra-arterial liver treatment at two recruiting centers 
were retrospectively included. A reference selective volume (RSV) was calculated 
from the selective CBCT by manual segmentation and was used as a reference 
standard. The Virtual Perfusion Volume (VPV) was then obtained using Liver 
ASSIST Virtual Parenchyma software on proximal CBCT angiography using the same 
injection point as for selective CBCT. RSV and VPV were then compared as 
absolute, relative, and signed volumetric errors (ABSerr, RVerr and SVerr 
respectively), while their spatial correspondence was assessed using the DICE 
similarity coefficient.
RESULTS: The software was technically successful in automatically computing VPV 
in 74/78 cases (94.8%).On the 74 analyzed couples, median RSV was not 
significantly different from VPV (394 cc [196 - 640cc] and 391 cc [192 - 620cc] 
respectively, p=0.435).Median ABSErr, RVErr, SVErr and DICE similarity 
coefficient were 40.9 cc [19.9 - 97.7 cc], 12.8% [5-22%], 9.9 cc [-49.0 - 40.4 
cc]and 80% [76%-84%], respectively.No significant ABSErr, RVErr, SVErr and DICE 
similarity coefficient differences were found between the two centers (p=0.574, 
0.612, 0.416 and 0.674, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Perfusion hepatic volumes simulated on proximal enhanced CBCT using 
the virtual parenchyma software are numerically and spatially similar to those 
manually obtained on selective CBCT."
1016,"INTRODUCTION: Working parents, and a rising number of adults delivering care for 
ageing relatives, experience numerous challenges in their personal, family, 
professional and financial lives due to multiple responsibilities. This study 
describes the experiences of Canadian radiation oncology (RO) parents and family 
caregivers, reporting challenges that may exist in providing family care with 
clinical/academic work commitments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Canadian RO's were invited to participate in an anonymous 
online survey, via RO heads of departments in cancer centres across Canada and 
to physician members of the Canadian Association of Radiation Oncology between 
November 2021 and January 2022. The survey focused on demographics, experiences 
of pregnancy and leave, parenting and adult caregiving responsibilities, and 
self-care.
RESULTS: 103 (38%) staff RO completed the survey, 78 (75.7%) identified as 
having a parental (76, 89.7%) and/or other family caregiver (8, 10.3%) role. 41% 
were female (59% male), with no difference between gender and number of children 
(median 2, IQR 1-3, p=0.17). More female respondents took parental leave for 
their first child compared to male (mean 29 versus 6 weeks, p<0.001). 27% of 
male respondents who started caring for their first child during residency took 
parental leave compared to 77% (p=0.003) as a staff. The majority of respondents 
described ""always/usually"" collegial support for each pregnancy and parental 
leave. Both genders described parental responsibilities as negatively impacting 
attendance at conferences (male - 65%, female - 77%, p=0.31) and early/late 
work-related meetings (male - 76%, female 79%, p=1.0). More female respondents 
described parental responsibilities as negatively impacting their career (50% vs 
29%, p=0.085). 52% of female respondents (vs 26% male respondents, p=0.044) 
identified a physician mentor or positive role model around parenting issues.
CONCLUSION: Parental and other family caregiving responsibilities are not gender 
unique in Canadian ROs but competing work and family roles may impact genders 
differently."
1017,"FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) is a promising radiation technique that uses 
ultra-high doses of radiation to increase the therapeutic window of the 
treatment. FLASH-RT has been observed to provide normal tissue sparing at high 
dose rates and similar tumor control than conventional radiotherapy, yet the 
biological processes governing these radiobiological effects are still unknown. 
In this study, we sought to investigate the potential immune response generated 
by FLASH-RT in a high dose of proton therapy in an orthotopic glioma rat model. 
Thus, we cranially irradiated rats with a single high dose (25 Gy) using FLASH 
dose rate proton irradiation (257 ± 2 Gy/s) or conventional dose rate proton 
irradiation (4 ± 0.02 Gy/s). We first assessed the protective FLASH effect that 
resulted in our setup through behavioral studies in naïve rats. This was 
followed by a comprehensive analysis of immune cells in blood, healthy tissue of 
the brain and tumor microenvironment by flow cytometry. Proton FLASH-RT spared 
memory impairment produced by conventional high-dose proton therapy and induced 
a similar tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) recruitment. Additionally, a 
general neuroinflammation that was similar in both dose rates was observed. 
Overall, this study demonstrated a FLASH proton therapy offers a 
neuro-protective effect even at high doses while is able of mounting an 
effective lymphoid immune response in the tumor."
1018,"BACKGROUND: Common, operational definitions are crucial to assess interventions 
and outcomes related to pediatric mechanical ventilation. These definitions can 
reduce unnecessary variability amongst research and quality improvement efforts, 
to ensure findings are generalizable and can be pooled to establish best 
practices.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Can we establish operational definitions for key elements 
related to pediatric ventilator liberation using a combination of detailed 
literature review and consensus-based approaches?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A panel of 26 international experts in pediatric 
ventilator liberation, two methodologists and two librarians conducted 
systematic reviews on eight topic areas related to pediatric ventilator 
liberation. Through a series of virtual meetings, we established draft 
definitions which were voted upon using an anonymous web-based process. 
Definitions were revised by incorporating extracted data gathered during the 
systematic review and discussed in another consensus meeting. A second round of 
voting was conducted to confirm the final definitions.
RESULTS: In eight topic areas identified by the experts, 16 preliminary 
definitions were established. Based on initial discussion and the first round of 
voting, modifications were suggested for 11 of the 16 definitions. There was 
significant variability in how these items were defined in the literature 
reviewed. The final round of voting achieved ≥80% agreement for all 16 
definitions in the following areas: what constitutes respiratory support 
(invasive mechanical ventilation and non-invasive respiratory support), 
liberation and failed attempts to liberate from invasive mechanical ventilation, 
liberation from respiratory support, duration of non-invasive respiratory 
support, total duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, spontaneous 
breathing trials, extubation readiness testing, 28-ventilator free days, and 
planned vs rescue use of post-extubation non-invasive respiratory support.
INTERPRETATION: We propose these consensus-based definitions for elements of 
pediatric ventilator liberation, informed by evidence, be used for future 
quality improvement initiatives and research studies to improve 
generalizability, and facilitate comparison."
1019,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between breastfeeding history, including 
lifetime exclusive breastfeeding, and adenomyosis risk.
DESIGN: We used data from a case-control study designed with two control groups 
to address the challenge of selecting non-cases for a valid epidemiologic study 
when cases are identified by hysterectomy. The case-control study was conducted 
among pre- and post-menopausal enrollees ages 18-59 years of a large, integrated 
healthcare system in western Washington State.
SUBJECTS: Cases were enrollees with incident, pathology-confirmed adenomyosis 
diagnosed 2001-2006 (n=386). The two control groups were: 1) randomly selected 
age-matched enrollees with intact uteri (""population controls"", n=323) and 2) 
hysterectomy controls (n=233).
EXPOSURE: Data on breastfeeding history were collected by in-person interview. 
For each live birth reported, participants were asked if they breastfed, along 
with infant age at supplemental feeding introduction and breastfeeding 
discontinuation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Among participants with at least one live birth (330 
cases, 246 population controls, and 198 hysterectomy controls), we used 
unconditional logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between 1) ever breastfeeding, 2) 
ever breastfeeding for ≥ 8 weeks, 3) lifetime breastfeeding, and 4) lifetime 
exclusive breastfeeding and adenomyosis. Analyses were adjusted for age, 
reference year, smoking, education, and parity.
RESULTS: In analyses comparing cases to population controls, we observed a 40% 
decreased odds of adenomyosis with history of ever breastfeeding (adjusted odds 
ratio 0.6, 95% CI: 0.3-1.0) and breastfeeding ≥ 8 weeks (adjusted odds ratio 
0.6, 95% CI: 0.4-0.8). The strongest associations, 60-70% decreased odds of 
adenomyosis, were observed with ≥12 months of lifetime breastfeeding (vs. <3 
months) (adjusted odds ratio 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.6; P<0.001 for trend) and 9-<12 
months of lifetime exclusive breastfeeding (vs. <3 months) (adjusted odds ratio 
0.3, 95% CI: 0.2-0.6; P<0.001 for trend), comparing cases to population 
controls. In analyses using hysterectomy controls, we observed similar patterns 
of associations slightly attenuated in magnitude.
CONCLUSION: Breastfeeding history was associated with a 40% decreased odds of 
adenomyosis, a condition that can confer substantial morbidity and requires 
hysterectomy for definitive treatment. The consistency of our findings with that 
of a prior study lend support that breastfeeding may modify adenomyosis risk."
1020,"BACKGROUND: Presence of depressive symptoms prior to hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant is a common experience with long-term impacts on survival.
OBJECTIVES: Using the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain 
Criteria framework, this study sought to characterize depressive symptoms in 
patients prior to transplant through exploratory factor analysis and determine 
whether depressive factors were significant predictors of long-term survival.
STUDY DESIGN: Individuals were included in the study if they were preparing to 
undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplant and endorsed depressive symptoms 
measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Patients were scheduled to undergo 
transplant between 2005 and 2010. Survival analyses were conducted in 2022 to 
assess long-term outcomes. The primary outcomes were 1) exploring the factor 
structure of the Beck Depression Inventory-II and 2) conducing univariate and 
multivariate Cox regression analyses of depression symptoms and known 
demographic and disease characteristics that impact survival.
RESULTS: Of the 695 participants included in the study, most were male, middle 
age (M age = 55.08, SD = 11.75), White, and married. Exploratory factor analysis 
revealed a four-factor structure consisting of ""Negative Valence Systems: 
Internalizing"" (e.g., worthlessness, guilt), ""Arousal and Threat"" (e.g., 
agitation, irritability), ""Arousal and Regulatory Systems"" (e.g., loss of 
energy, fatigue), and ""Negative Valence Systems: Externalizing"" (e.g., loss of 
pleasure, loss of interest). Univariate survival analyses found that age, 
gender, disease type, acute graft versus host disease, and Negative Valence 
Systems: Externalizing were significant predictors of survival. Transplant type, 
chronic graft versus host disease, performance status, and the other three 
depression factor structures were not significant in univariate models. In the 
multivariate model, older age (HR: 1.031, 95% CI: 1.021-1.041, p<.001) and 
presence of Negative Valence Systems: Externalizing symptoms (HR: 1.132, 95% CI: 
1.030-1.244, p=.010) were significant predictors of shorter survival. 
Additionally, individuals diagnosed with acute leukemia were significantly more 
likely to have shorter survival compared to other disease types including 
amyloidosis (HR: 0.362, 95% CI: 0.229-0.575, p<.001) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(HR: 0.526, 95% CI: 0.349-0.793, p=.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Exploratory factor analysis of depressive symptoms mapped well onto 
the Research Domain Criteria constructs. Loss of pleasure and loss of interest, 
two key components of depression, were predictive of shorter survival. 
Exploration of key components of depression rather than the total depression 
score may provide important prognostic information for long-term survivorship 
and may help inform future and more individualized care."
1021,"Piper longum has a specific aroma and spicy taste. In addition to edible value, 
current studies have shown that piper longum also has pharmacological activities 
such as anti-platelet aggregation, anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, anti-diabetes 
and anti-depression. Piperlongumine is an alkaloid isolated from Piper longum. 
Based on our previous studies, four Piperlongumine analogs were synthesized, and 
their anti-platelet aggregation activities were evaluated. Among them, compound 
8 has the strongest anti-platelet aggregation activity. Therefore, compound 8 
was docked with stroke-related protein targets, and it was found that compound 8 
had good binding affinity to MRTF-A complex and Bcl-2. Through animal 
experiments, it was found that compound 8 could significantly improve the 
pathological damage of brain tissue after ischemia and could increase the 
expression of MRTF-A and Bcl-2 in cerebral cortex in rats. These results suggest 
that compound 8 may have a good inhibitory effect on apoptosis and tissue 
structurel disorders induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, so as to reduce 
the injury caused by ischemic stroke."
1022,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancer among men and 
women. The grading of dysplasia and the detection of adenocarcinoma are 
important clinical tasks in the diagnosis of CRC and shape the patients' 
follow-up plans. This study evaluates the feasibility of deep learning models 
for the classification of colorectal lesions into four classes: benign, 
low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and adenocarcinoma. To this end, a 
deep neural network was developed on a training set of 655 whole slide images of 
digitized colorectal resection slides from a tertiary medical institution; and 
the network was evaluated on an internal test set of 234 slides, as well as on 
an external test set of 606 adenocarcinoma slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas 
database. The model achieves an overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity 
of 95.5%, 91.0%, and 97.1%, respectively, on the internal test set and an 
accuracy and sensitivity of 98.5% for adenocarcinoma detection task on the 
external test set. Results suggest that such deep learning models can 
potentially assist pathologists in grading colorectal dysplasia, detecting 
adenocarcinoma, prescreening, and prioritizing the reviewing of suspicious cases 
to improve the turnaround time for patients with a high risk of CRC. 
Furthermore, the high sensitivity on the external test set suggests the model's 
generalizability in detecting colorectal adenocarcinoma on whole slide images 
across different institutions."
1023,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone cancer whose standard treatment 
includes pre-operative chemotherapy followed by resection. Chemotherapy response 
is used for predicting prognosis and further management of patients. Necrosis is 
routinely assessed post-chemotherapy from histology slides on resection 
specimens where necrosis ratio is defined as the ratio of necrotic tumor to 
overall tumor. Patients with necrosis ratio ≥90% are known to have better 
outcome. Manual microscopic review of necrosis ratio from multiple glass slides 
is semi-quantitative and can have intra- and inter-observer variability. In this 
study, an objective and reproducible deep learning-based approach is proposed to 
estimate necrosis ratio with outcome prediction from scanned hematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E) whole slide images (WSIs). To conduct the study, 103 osteosarcoma 
cases with 3134 WSIs were collected. Deep Multi-Magnification Network was 
trained to segment multiple tissue subtypes including viable tumor and necrotic 
tumor in pixel-level and to calculate case-level necrosis ratio from multiple 
WSIs. Necrosis ratio estimated by the segmentation model highly correlates with 
necrosis ratio from pathology reports manually assessed by experts. Furthermore, 
patients were successfully stratified to predict overall survival (OS) with 
p=2.4×10-6 and progression-free survival (PFS) with p=0.016. This study 
indicates deep learning can support pathologists as an objective tool to analyze 
osteosarcoma from histology for assessing treatment response and predicting 
patient outcome."
1024,"OBJECTIVE: This prospective cohort study aimed to compare the clinical efficacy 
and safety of goserelin 10.8 mg administered trimonthly with goserelin 3.6 mg 
administered monthly in premenopausal females with symptomatic adenomyosis.
METHODS: We recruited 139 premenopausal females with adenomyosis who complained 
of dysmenorrhea and/or menorrhagia. The first group (n = 70) received a single 
subcutaneous injection of goserelin 10.8 mg, and the second group (n = 69) 
received monthly subcutaneous goserelin 3.6 mg administered for 3 months. 
Follow-up was performed at the outpatient department after 12 weeks.
RESULTS: Ultimately, 130 patients completed the study, including 68 and 62 
patients in the goserelin 10.8 mg (n = 70) and 3.6 mg (n = 69) groups, 
respectively. We observed a significant decrease in the dysmenorrhea (NRS) 
score, uterine volume, and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels, and a significant 
increase in hemoglobin (HGB) levels in both treatment groups. There was no 
significant difference between the two groups. The sum of the adverse event 
scores was slightly higher in the goserelin 3.6 mg than in the 10.8 mg group.
CONCLUSIONS: The clinical efficacy of trimonthly administration of goserelin 
10.8 mg was equivalent to monthly 3.6 mg dosing and was non-inferior regarding 
safety and tolerability. Hence, it can be a more cost-effective and convenient 
alternative treatment option in premenopausal females with symptomatic 
adenomyosis.

1025,"BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with poor 
prognosis, and new treatment options are urgently needed. About 34%-39% of 
primary TNBCs show a low expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2-low), which is a target for new anti-HER2 drugs. However, little is known 
about the frequency and the prognostic value of HER2-low in metastatic TNBC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included patients with TNBC from five 
European countries for this international, multicenter analysis. 
Triple-negativity had to be shown in a metastatic site or in the primary breast 
tumor diagnosed simultaneously or within 3 years before metastatic disease. 
HER2-low was defined as immunohistochemically (IHC) 1+ or 2+ without ERBB2 gene 
amplification. Survival probabilities were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier 
method, and multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by Cox regression 
models.
RESULTS: In total, 691 patients, diagnosed between January 2006 and February 
2021, were assessable. The incidence of HER2-low was 32.0% [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 28.5% to 35.5%], with similar proportions in metastases (n = 265; 
29.8%) and primary tumors (n = 425; 33.4%; P = 0.324). The median overall 
survival (OS) in HER2-low and HER2-0 TNBC was 18.6 and 16.1 months, respectively 
(HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.83-1.19; P = 0.969). Similarly, in multivariable analysis, 
HER2-low had no significant impact on OS (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.79-1.13; P = 0.545). 
No difference in prognosis was observed between HER2 IHC 0/1+ and IHC 2+ tumors 
(HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.69-1.17; P = 0.414).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large international dataset of metastatic TNBC, the 
frequency of HER2-low was 32.0%. Neither in univariable nor in multivariable 
analysis HER2-low showed any influence on OS."
1026,"INTRODUCTION: Pectoral fascia (PF) removal during mastectomy still seems to be 
the standard procedure. However, preservation of the PF might improve 
postoperative and cosmetic outcomes, without compromising oncological safety. 
Here, we report on a national survey among Dutch plastic surgeons and 
oncological breast surgeons to evaluate their techniques and opinions regarding 
the PF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey based study was performed in the Netherlands, in 
which both plastic surgeons and oncological breast surgeons were included, each 
receiving a different version of the survey. The surveys were distributed to 460 
and 150 e-mail addresses, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 68 responses were included from more than half of all Dutch 
medical centers. The results of this study indicate that circa one in five 
plastic surgeons and breast surgeons routinely preserve the PF during 
mastectomies and even more surgeons preserve the PF in specific cases. The 
surgical techniques and opinions regarding PF preservation widely differ between 
surgeons.
CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of the PF does occur in a substantial part of the 
Dutch medical centers and techniques and opinions are contradictory. Future 
studies on this topic should clarify the effect of PF preservation on 
oncological safety, complication rates, postoperative pain, cosmetic outcomes, 
and patient satisfaction."
1027,"OBJECTIVES: Adipose tissue distribution and radiodensity are associated with 
prognosis in many types of cancer. However, the roles of adipose tissue 
distribution and radiodensity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(mCRC) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic effect 
of adiposity and adipose tissue radiodensities in patients with mCRC.
METHODS: Patients with mCRC who received first-line palliative chemotherapy and 
had a computed tomography (CT) scan at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) level, 
admitted between January 2010 and December 2018, were sequentially enrolled. 
Body composition was assessed using CT-derived measurements. Univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to 
determine prognostic values.
RESULTS: The study included 237 patients. Cox analyses demonstrated that high 
subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) index was associated with a lower risk for 
death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.88; Ptrend 
< 0.025). There was no significant association between visceral adipose tissue 
(VAT) index tertiles and overall survival. However, high VAT and SAT 
radiodensities were significantly associated with increased mortality (HR, 1.80; 
95% CI, 1.12-2.89; Ptrend < 0.030 and HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.19-2.86; Ptrend < 
0.021, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: A higher SAT index in patients with mCRC was associated with a 
favorable overall survival outcome, whereas higher SAT and VAT radiodensities 
were associated with an increased risk for death, supporting that early 
nutritional intervention may improve mCRC prognosis."
1028,"OBJECTIVES: Individuals with prior cancer diagnosis are more likely to have low 
muscle mass (LMM) than their cancer-free counterparts. Understanding the effects 
of LMM on the prognosis of cancer survivors can be clinically important. The aim 
of this study was to investigate whether risks for all-cause and cardiovascular 
disease (CVD)-specific mortality differ by status of LMM in cancer survivors and 
a matched cohort without cancer history.
METHODS: We used cohort data from the 1999-2006 and 2011-2014 National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants included 946 adults surviving for 
≥1 since cancer diagnosis and a matched cohort (by age, sex, and race) without 
cancer history (N = 1857). LMM was defined by appendicular lean mass and body 
height (men <7.26 kg/m2, women <5.45 kg/m2). Death was ascertained via the 
National Death Index and cause of death was assessed via International 
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of LMM.
RESULTS: The mean age of cancer survivors and matched cohort was 60.6 y (SD 15) 
and 60.2 y (SD 14.9), respectively. The median follow-up was 10.5 y for 
survivors and 10.9 y for matched cohort. Overall, 22.2% of cancer survivors and 
19.7% of the matched cohort had LMM, respectively. In all, 321 survivors (33.9%) 
and 495 participants (26.7%) in the matched cohort died during follow-up. 
CVD-specific deaths were identified in 58 survivors (6.1%) and 122 participants 
in the matched cohort (6.6%). The multivariable Cox model suggested that LMM was 
positively associated with all-cause (aHR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.31-2.29) and 
CVD-specific (aHR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.14-4.00) mortality in cancer survivors. The 
associations between LMM and risk for all-cause (aHR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.98-1.56) 
and CVD-specific (aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.75-1.93) mortality were not statistically 
significant in the matched cohort.
CONCLUSION: Cancer survivors with LMM have an increased risk for all-cause and 
CVD-specific mortality. This increase appears to be larger than that in 
counterparts without cancer history."
1029,"Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is identified as a promising 
target for cancer therapy. However, known NAMPT inhibitors are characterized by 
weak clinical efficacy and dose-dependent toxicity. There is an urgent need to 
develop new NAMPT intervention strategies. Using the proteolysis-targeting 
chimera (PROTAC) technology, we designed and synthesized a series of new von 
Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-recruiting NAMPT-targeting PROTACs. A highly potent NAMPT 
degrader (B3) was successfully identified, which displayed excellent degradation 
activity (DC50 < 0.17 nM, Dmax > 90%) and antiproliferative potency against 
A2780 cells (IC50 = 1.5 nM). PROTAC B3 induced NAMPT depletion in a 
concentration- and time-dependent manner through the ubiquitin-proteasome 
system. Particularly, PROTAC B3 achieved good plasma exposure levels via 
intravenous injection, gained potent tumor growth inhibition (TGI = 88.1%, 2 
μM/kg) in the xenograft model, and demonstrated good biosafety without undesired 
toxicities. This study provides a highly potent VHL-recruiting NAMPT degrader 
for the treatment of ovarian cancer."
1030,"OBJECTIVES: Over 50 countries are affected by arsenic contamination. The problem 
is becoming worse as the number of affected people increases and new sites are 
reported globally.
CONTENT: Various human activities have increased arsenic pollution, notably in 
both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Contamination of our water and soil 
by arsenic poses a threat to our environment and natural resources. Arsenic 
poisoning harms several physiological systems and may cause cancer and death. 
Excessive exposure may cause toxic build-up in human and animal tissues. 
Arsenic-exposed people had different skin lesion shapes and were vulnerable to 
extra arsenic-induced illness risks. So far, research shows that varying 
susceptibility plays a role in arsenic-induced diseases. Several studies have 
revealed that arsenic is a toxin that reduces metabolic activities. Diverse 
remediation approaches are being developed to control arsenic in surrounding 
environments.
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: A sustainable clean-up technique (nanoremediation) is 
required to restore natural equilibrium. More research is therefore required to 
better understand the biogeochemical processes involved in removing arsenic from 
soils and waters."
1031,"OBJECTIVES: Determine the frequency of actionable mutations in non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) and their correlation with overall survival (OS) and the 
site of metastases.
METHODS: We performed a descriptive cross-sectional study at the Hospital de 
Especialidades Eugenio Espejo, Ecuador, between 2017 and 2020. Demographic, 
pathological, and molecular alterations in epidermal growth factor (EGFR), 
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1), Programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and clinical data detailed in patients' 
medical records with metastatic NSCLC were collected and analyzed. Seventy-nine 
stage IV patients had NSCLC; adenocarcinoma histology represents 56 (70.9%). The 
predominant mutation was in EGFR (22.8%); the most common variant was the 
deletion of exon 19 (72.2%). The most common metastatic site was in the 
contralateral lung (22.3%); however, this variable showed no significant 
correlation to the molecular markers (p=0.057). The overall survival (OS) and 
the status of molecular markers are not statistically significant (p=0.27). OS 
was better for non-mutated EGFR than for mutated EGFR (p=0.012). However, the 
frequency values are unrelated to contralateral lung metastasis or survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Our frequency mutations are concordant with those found in other 
studies in Latin America. EGFR was the most common biomarker mutation, and there 
was a better OS in EGFR non-mutated patient."
1032,"BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of N2 lymph node status of the resectable stage 
I-II non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) before surgery is crucial, while there 
is lack of corresponding method clinically.
PURPOSE: To develop and validate a model to quantitively predict the N2 lymph 
node metastasis in presurgical clinical stage I-II NSCLC using multiview 
radiomics and deep learning method.
METHODS: In this study, 140 NSCLC patients were enrolled in this retrospective 
study and randomly divided into training and test sets. Univariate and multiple 
analysis method were used step by step to establish the clinical model; Then a 
multiview radiomics modeling scheme was designed, in which the optimal input 
feature set was determined by subcategorizing radiomics features (C1: original; 
C2: LoG and C3: wavelet) and comparison of corresponding radiomics model. The 
minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR) selection and the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm were used for the feature 
selection and construction of each radiomics model (Rad). Next, an end-to-end 
ResNet18 architecture and transfer learning techniques were designed to 
construct a deep learning model (DL). Subsequently, the screened clinical risk 
factors and constructed Rad and DL models were combined and compared and a 
nomogram was constructed. Finally, the diagnostic performance of all constructed 
models were evaluated and compared using receiver operating characteristic curve 
(ROC) analysis, Delong test, Calibration analysis, Hosmer-Lemeshow test and 
decision curves, respectively.
RESULTS: Carcinoma Embryonic Antigen level and spiculation were screened to make 
up the Clinical model, while 7 radiomics features in the optimal input feature 
set C2+C3 were selected to construct the Rad. DL was constructed by training on 
1.8 million natural images and small sample data of our N2 lymph node volume of 
interest (VOI) images. Except for the Clinical model, all other models showed 
good predictive accuracy and consistency in both training set and test set. DL 
(area under curve (AUC): 0.83) was better than Rad (AUC: 0.76) in predictive 
accuracy, but their difference was not significant (p = 0.45). The combined 
models showed better diagnostic performance than the model only clinical or 
image risk factors were used (AUC for Clinical, Rad+DL, Rad+Clinical, 
DL+Clinical, Rad+DL+Clinical were respectively 0.66, 0.86, 0.82, 0.86, 0.88). 
Finally, the Rad+DL+Clinical model with the best diagnostic performance was 
selected to draw the final nomogram for clinical use.
CONCLUSION: This study proposes a nomogram based on multiview radiomics, deep 
learning and clinical features that can be efficiently used to quantitively 
predict presurgical N2 diseases in patients with clinical stage I-II NSCLC. This

1033,"INTRODUCTION: Autophagy is a highly conservative self-degradative process. It 
aims at elimination-impaired proteins and cellular organelles. Previous research 
confirmed the autophagy role in cancer pathogenesis.
AREAS COVERED: This article discusses the role of autophagy in the development 
of AML. Autophagy seems to be a 'double-sword' mechanism, hence, either its 
suppression or induction could promote neoplasm growth. This mechanism could 
also be the aim of the 'molecular targeted therapy'. Chemo- and radiotherapy 
induce cellular stress in neoplasm cells with subsequent autophagy suppression. 
Simultaneously, it is claimed that the autophagy suppression increases 
chemosensitivity 'in neoplastic cells. Some agents, like bortezomib, in turn 
could promote autophagy process, e.g., in AML (acute myeloid leukemia). However, 
currently there are not many studies focusing on the role of autophagy in 
patients suffering for AML. In this review, we summarize the research done so 
far on the role of autophagy in the development of AML.
EXPERT OPINION: The analysis of autophagy genes expression profiling in AML 
could be a relevant factor in the diagnostic process and treatment 
'individualization'. Autophagy modulation seems to be a relevant target in the 
oncological therapy - it could limit disease progression and increase the 
effectiveness of treatment."
1034,"Endothelin receptor A (ETA), a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is a 
promising tumor-associated antigen due to its close association with the 
progression and metastasis of many types of cancer, such as colorectal, breast, 
lung, ovarian, and prostate cancer. However, only small-molecule drugs have been 
developed as ETA antagonists with anticancer effects. In a previous study, we 
identified an antibody (AG8) with highly selective binding to human ETA through 
screening of a human naïve immune antibody library. Although both in vitro and 
in vivo experiments indicated that the identified AG8 had anticancer effects, 
there is a need for improvement in biochemical and physicochemical properties 
such as the ETA binding affinity, thermostability, and productivity. In this 
study, we engineered the framework regions of AG8 and isolated an anti-ETA 
antibody (MJF1) exhibiting significantly improved thermostability and ETA 
binding affinity. Subsequently, our previously isolated PFc29, an Fc variant 
with an enhanced pH-dependent human FcRn binding profile, was introduced to 
MJF1, and the resulting Fc-engineered anti-ETA antibody (MJF1-PFc29) inhibited 
the proliferation of tumor cells comparably to MJF1 and showed a 4.2-fold 
increased serum half-life in human FcRn transgenic mice. Moreover, MJF1-PFc29 
elicited higher tumor growth inhibition in colorectal cancer xenograft mice 
compared to MJF1. Our results demonstrate that the engineered human anti-ETA 
antibody MJF1-PFc29 has great therapeutic potential and high antitumor potency 
against various types of cancers including colorectal cancer."
1035,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate treatment modalities of T4 larynx cancer in older adults 
using SEER-Medicare.
METHODS: The database was queried for patients aged 66 and older with 
nonmetastatic T4 laryngeal squamous cell cancer from 2006 to 2015. Treatment 
modalities compared were surgery plus chemoradiation (SCR), surgery plus 
radiation (SR), chemoradiation (CR), surgery (S), and radiation (R). 
Multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to explore the 
relationship of treatment modality and survival. Total cancer-related costs were 
calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 438 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients receiving CR 
or SR had similar CSS to SCR (HR 1.36 and HR 1.24, respectively). Those 
receiving S (HR 2.00) or R (HR 2.41) had significantly worse CSS. Similar 
findings were observed for OS. Cancer care-related costs were not significantly 
different but highest in SCR ($162215) and lowest in R ($121421).
CONCLUSION: Older patients with T4 larynx cancer had similar survival rates when 
treated with CR, SR, and SCR. Average total health care costs were not 
significantly different between modalities. Patients not eligible for 
triple-modality could consider these other treatment options."
1036,"Nowadays, hydrogels-based microneedles (MNs) have attracted a great interest 
owing to their outstanding qualities for biomedical applications. For the 
fabrication of hydrogels-based microneedles as tissue engineering scaffolds and 
drug delivery carriers, various biomaterials have been tested. They are required 
to feature tunable physiochemical properties, biodegradability, 
biocompatibility, non-immunogenicity, high drug loading capacity, and sustained 
drug release. Among biomaterials, human proteins are the most ideal biomaterials 
for fabrication of hydrogels-based MNs; however, they are mechanically weak and 
poorly processible. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of 
xeno-free human protein-based MNs so far. Here, we engineered human 
albumin-based hydrogels and microneedles for tissue engineering and drug 
delivery by using relatively new processible human serum albumin methacryloyl 
(HSAMA). The resultant HSAMA hydrogels displayed tunable mechanical properties, 
biodegradability, and good biocompatibility. Moreover, the xeno-free HSAMA 
microneedles displayed a sustained drug release profile and significant 
mechanical strength to penetrate the model skin. In vitro, they also showed good 
biocompatibility and anti-cancer efficacy. Sustainable processible human 
albumin-based biomaterials might be employed as a xeno-free platform in vivo for 
tissue engineering and drug delivery in clinical trials in the future. This

1037,"INTRODUCTION: Brain metastases in patients with extracranial cancer are 
typically associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Stereotactic 
radiotherapy and immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors currently are 
essential in brain metastases treatment. Since conventional contrast-enhanced 
MRI alone cannot reliably differentiate between treatment-induced changes and 
brain metastasis relapse, several studies investigated the role of PET imaging 
and, more recently, radiomics, based on routinely acquired PET images, to 
overcome this clinically relevant challenge.
AREAS COVERED: The current literature on PET imaging, including radiomics, in 
patients with brain metastases, focusing on the diagnosis and assessment of 
post-treatment relapse, is summarized.
EXPERT OPINION: Available data suggest that imaging parameters, including 
radiomics features, mainly derived from amino acid PET, are helpful for 
diagnosis and assessment of post-treatment relapse in patients with brain 
metastases."
1038,"Epigenetic dysregulation of cell cycle is a hallmark of tumorigenesis in 
multiple cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nonetheless, the 
epigenetic mechanisms underlying the aberrant cell cycle signaling and 
therapeutic response remain unclear. Here, we used an epigenetics-focused CRISPR 
interference screen and identified ACTR5 (actin-related protein 5), a component 
of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, to be essential for HCC tumor 
progression. Suppression of ACTR5 activated CDKN2A expression, ablated 
CDK/E2F-driven cell cycle signaling, and attenuated HCC tumor growth. 
Furthermore, high-density CRISPR gene tiling scans revealed a distinct 
HCC-specific usage of ACTR5 and its interacting partner IES6 compared to the 
other INO80 complex members, suggesting an INO80-independent mechanism of 
ACTR5/IES6 in supporting the HCC proliferation. Last, our study revealed the 
synergism between ACTR5/IES6-targeting and pharmacological inhibition of CDK in 
treating HCC. These results indicate that the dynamic interplay between 
epigenetic regulators, tumor suppressors, and cell cycle machinery could provide 
novel opportunities for combinational HCC therapy."
1039,"Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin (Dox) are effective chemotherapies, but their 
use is limited by cardiac toxicity. We hypothesized that plasma proteomics in 
women with breast cancer could identify new mechanisms of anthracycline cardiac 
toxicity. We measured changes in 1317 proteins in anthracycline-treated patients 
(n = 30) and replicated key findings in a second cohort (n = 31). An increase in 
the heme-binding protein hemopexin (Hpx) 3 months after anthracycline initiation 
was associated with cardiac toxicity by echocardiography. To assess the 
functional role of Hpx, we administered Hpx to wild-type (WT) mice treated with 
Dox and observed improved cardiac function. Conversely, Hpx-/- mice demonstrated 
increased Dox cardiac toxicity compared to WT mice. Initial mechanistic studies 
indicate that Hpx is likely transported to the heart by circulating 
monocytes/macrophages and that Hpx may mitigate Dox-induced ferroptosis to 
confer cardioprotection. Together, these observations suggest that Hpx induction 
represents a compensatory response during Dox treatment."
1040,"Translation control is essential in balancing hematopoietic precursors and 
differentiation; however, the mechanisms underlying this program are poorly 
understood. We found that the activity of the major cap-binding protein eIF4E is 
unexpectedly regulated in a dynamic manner throughout erythropoiesis that is 
uncoupled from global protein synthesis rates. Moreover, eIF4E activity directs 
erythroid maturation, and increased eIF4E expression maintains cells in an early 
erythroid state associated with a translation program driving the expression of 
PTPN6 and Igf2bp1. A cytosine-enriched motif in the 5' untranslated region is 
important for eIF4E-mediated translation specificity. Therefore, selective 
translation of key target genes necessary for the maintenance of early erythroid 
states by eIF4E highlights a unique mechanism used by hematopoietic precursors 
to rapidly elicit erythropoietic maturation upon need."
1041,"The human adenosine A2B receptor (A2BR) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor 
that is involved in several major physiological and pathological processes 
throughout the body. A2BR recognizes its ligands adenosine and NECA with 
relatively low affinity, but the detailed mechanism for its ligand recognition 
and signaling is still elusive. Here, we present two structures determined by 
cryo-electron microscopy of A2BR bound to its agonists NECA and BAY60-6583, each 
coupled to an engineered Gs protein. The structures reveal conserved orthosteric 
binding pockets with subtle differences, whereas the selectivity or specificity 
can mainly be attributed to regions extended from the orthosteric pocket. We 
also found that BAY60-6583 occupies a secondary pocket, where residues V2506.51 
and N2737.36 were two key determinants for its selectivity against A2BR. This 
study offers a better understanding of ligand selectivity for the adenosine 
receptor family and provides a structural template for further development of 
A2BR ligands for related diseases."
1042,"CD73, a cell surface-bound nucleotidase, facilitates extracellular adenosine 
formation by hydrolyzing 5'-AMP to adenosine. Several studies have shown that 
CD73 plays an essential role in immune escape, cell proliferation and tumor 
angiogenesis, making it an attractive target for cancer therapies. However, 
there are limited clinical benefits associated with the mainstream enzymatic 
inhibitors of CD73, suggesting that the mechanism underlying the role of CD73 in 
tumor progression is more complex than anticipated, and further investigation is 
necessary. In this study, CD73 is found to overexpress in the cytoplasm of 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells and promotes metastasis in a 
nucleotidase-independent manner, which cannot be restrained by the CD73 
monoclonal antibodies or small-molecule enzymatic inhibitors. Furthermore, CD73 
promotes the metastasis of PDAC by binding to the E3 ligase TRIM21, competing 
with the Snail for its binding site. Additionally, a CD73 transcriptional 
inhibitor, diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is more effective 
than the CD73 blocking antibody for the treatment of PDAC metastasis. Diclofenac 
also enhances the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine in the spontaneous KPC 
(LSL-KrasG12D/+ , LSL-Trp53R172H/+ , and Pdx-1-Cre) pancreatic cancer model. 
Therefore, diclofenac may be an effective anti-CD73 therapy, when used alone or 
in combination with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimen, for metastatic PDAC."
1043,"This article is part of the Dendritic Cell Guidelines article series, which 
provides a collection of state-of-the-art protocols for the preparation, 
phenotype analysis by flow cytometry, generation, fluorescence microscopy, and 
functional characterization of mouse and human dendritic cells (DC) from 
lymphoid organs and various non-lymphoid tissues. Recent studies have provided 
evidence for an increasing number of phenotypically distinct conventional DC 
(cDC) subsets that on one hand exhibit a certain functional plasticity, but on 
the other hand are characterized by their tissue- and context-dependent 
functional specialization. Here, we describe a selection of assays for the 
functional characterization of mouse and human cDC. The first two protocols 
illustrate analysis of cDC endocytosis and metabolism, followed by guidelines 
for transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of cDC populations. Then, a 
larger group of assays describes the characterization of cDC migration in vitro, 
ex vivo, and in vivo. The final guidelines measure cDC inflammasome and antigen 
(cross)-presentation activity. While all protocols were written by experienced 
scientists who routinely use them in their work, this article was also 
peer-reviewed by leading experts and approved by all co-authors, making it an 
essential resource for basic and clinical DC immunologists."
1044,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has higher molecular heterogeneity and 
metastatic potential and the poorest prognosis. Because of limited therapeutics 
against TNBC, irradiation (IR) therapy is still a common treatment option for 
patients with lymph nodes or brain metastasis. Thus, it is urgent to develop 
strategies to enhance the sensitivity of TNBC tumors to low-dose IR. Here, the 
authors report that E3 ubiquitin ligase Ring finger protein 126 (RNF126) is 
important for IR-induced ATR-CHK1 pathway activation to enhance DNA damage 
repair (DDR). Mechanistically, RNF126 physically associates with the 
MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex and ubiquitinates MRE11 at K339 and K480 to 
increase its DNA exonuclease activity, subsequent RPA binding, and ATR 
phosphorylation, promoting sustained DDR in a homologous recombination 
repair-prone manner. Accordingly, depletion of RNF126 leads to increased genomic 
instability and radiation sensitivity in both TNBC cells and mice. Furthermore, 
it is found that RNF126 expression is induced by IR activating the 
HER2-AKT-NF-κB pathway and targeting RNF126 expression with dihydroartemisinin 
significantly improves the sensitivity of TNBC tumors in the brain to IR 
treatment in vivo. Together, these results reveal that RNF126-mediated MRE11 
ubiquitination is a critical regulator of the DDR, which provides a promising 
target for improving the sensitivity of TNBC to radiotherapy."
1045,"DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) is the most important epigenetic 
modification in mammals. Deciphering the roles of 5mC relies on the quantitative 
detection of 5mC at the single-base resolution. Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) is 
the most often employed technique for mapping 5mC in DNA. However, bisulfite 
treatment may cause serious degradation of input DNA due to the harsh reaction 
conditions. Here, we engineered the human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing 
catalytic polypeptide-like 3C (A3C) protein to endow the engineered A3C (eA3C) 
protein with differential deamination activity toward cytosine and 5mC. By the 
virtue of the unique property of eA3C, we proposed an engineered A3C sequencing 
(EAC-seq) method for the bisulfite-free and quantitative mapping of 5mC in DNA 
at the single-base resolution. In EAC-seq, the eA3C protein can deaminate C but 
not 5mC, which is employed to differentiate C and 5mC in sequencing. Using the 
EAC-seq method, we quantitatively detected 5mC in genomic DNA of lung cancer 
tissue. In contrast to the harsh reaction conditions of BS-seq, which could lead 
to significant degradation of DNA, the whole procedure of EAC-seq is carried out 
under mild conditions, thereby preventing DNA damage. Taken together, the 
EAC-seq approach is bisulfite-free and straightforward, making it an invaluable 
tool for the quantitative detection of 5mC in limited DNA at the single-base 
resolution."
1046,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare malignancy with a high 
prevalence in China. This study aimed to characterize the ICC tissues' bacterial 
metagenomics signature and explore its antitumor potential for cancer. In this 
study, 16S rRNA sequencing was carried out on 99 tissues to characterize the 
features of intratumoral microbiota, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) and multilevel validation. The presence of microbial DNA in tissues 
was determined using staining, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A Gram-positive aerobic bacterium, 
identified as Staphylococcus capitis, was cultured from fresh tissues. 
Meanwhile, scRNA-seq showed that intratumoral bacteria could be present in 
multiple cell types. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we identified a total of 
2,320,287 high-quality reads corresponding to 4,594 OTU (operational taxonomic 
units) sequences. The most abundant bacterial orders include Burkholderiales, 
Pseudomonadales, Xanthomonadales, Bacillales and Clostridiales. Alpha and Beta 
diversity analysis revealed specific features in different tissues. In addition, 
the content of Paraburkholderia fungorum was significantly higher in the 
paracancerous tissues and negatively correlated with CA199 (Carbohydrate 
antigen199) levels. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments suggest that 
P. fungorum possesses an antitumor activity against tumors. Metabolomics and 
transcriptomics showed that P. fungorum could inhibit tumor growth through 
alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. We determined the characteristic 
profile of the intratumoral microbiota and the antitumor effect of P. fungorum 
in ICC."
1047,"Painful benign bone tumors most commonly affect pediatric patients and young 
adults. They may be associated with skeletal-related events such as intractable 
pain, pathologic fracture, neurologic deficit as a consequence of nerve or 
spinal cord compression, as well as growth disturbance. Consequently, they often 
result in diminished activity and adversely affect quality of life. There have 
been substantial recent advances in percutaneous minimally invasive image-guided 
interventions for treatment of painful benign bone tumors including thermal 
ablation (radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, microwave ablation, laser 
photocoagulation, and high-intensity focused US ablation), chemical (alcohol) 
ablation, cementoplasty, and intralesional injections. The safety, efficacy, and 
durability of such interventions have been established in the recent literature 
and as such, the role of musculoskeletal interventional radiologists in the care 
of patients with benign bone lesions has substantially expanded. The treatment 
goal of minimally invasive musculoskeletal interventions in patients with benign 
bone tumors is to achieve definitive cure. The authors detail the most recent 
advances and available armamentarium in minimally invasive image-guided 
percutaneous interventions with curative intent for the management of benign 
bone tumors. © RSNA, 2022."
1048,"In peripheral blood, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) contains circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA), which indicates molecular abnormalities in metastatic breast tumor 
tissue. The sequencing of cfDNA of Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) patients 
allows assessment of therapy response and noninvasive treatment. In the proposed 
study, clinically significant alterations in PIK3CA and TP53 genes associated 
with MBC resulting in a missense substitution of His1047Arg and Arg282Trp from 
an next-generation sequencing-based multi-gene panel were reported in a cfDNA of 
a patient with MBC. To investigate the impact of the reported mutation, we used 
molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, network analysis, and pathway 
analysis. Molecular Docking analysis determined the distinct binding pattern 
revealing H1047R-ATP complex has a higher number of Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and 
binding affinity with a slight difference compared to the PIK3CA-ATP complex. 
Following, molecular dynamics simulation for 200 ns, of which H1047R-ATP complex 
resulted in the instability of PIK3CA. Similarly, for TP53 mutant R282W, the 
zinc-free state (apo) and zinc-bounded (holo) complexes were investigated for 
conformational change between apo and holo complexes, of which the holo complex 
mutant R282W was unstable. To validate the conformational change of PIK3CA and 
TP53, 80% mutation of H1047R in the kinase domain of p110α expressed 
ubiquitously in PIK3CA protein that alters PI3K pathway, while R282W mutation in 
DNA binding helix (H2) region of P53 protein inhibits the transcription factor 
in P53 pathway causing MBC. According to our findings, the extrinsic (hypoxia, 
oxidative stress, and acidosis); intrinsic factors (MYC amplification) in PIK3CA 
and TP53 mutations will provide potential insights for developing novel 
therapeutic methods for MBC therapy."
1049,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in 
women worldwide. Smoking is one of the risk factors for cervical cancer. 
Understanding the global distribution of the disease burden of cervical cancer 
attributable to smoking and related changes is of clear significance for the 
prevention and control of cervical cancer in key populations and for tobacco 
control. As far as we know, research on the burden of cervical cancer 
attributable to smoking is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: We estimated the disease burden and mortality of cervical cancer 
attributable to smoking and related trends over time at the global, regional, 
and national levels.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease study website. 
Age-standardized rates were used to facilitate comparisons of mortality and 
disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) at different levels. The estimated annual 
percentage change (EAPC) was used to assess trends in the age-standardized 
mortality rate (ASMR) and the age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR). A Pearson 
correlation analysis was used to evaluate correlations between the 
sociodemographic index and the age-standardized rates.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 30,136.65 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 
14,945.09-49,639.87) cervical cancer-related deaths and 893,735.25 (95% UI 
469,201.51-1,440,050.85) cervical cancer-related DALYs attributable to smoking. 
From 1990 to 2019, the global burden of cervical cancer attributable to smoking 
showed a decreasing trend around the world; the EAPCs for ASMR and ASDR were 
-2.11 (95% CI -2.16 to -2.06) and -2.22 (95% CI -2.26 to -2.18), respectively. 
In terms of age characteristics, in 2019, an upward trend was observed for age 
in the mortality of cervical cancer attributable to smoking. Analysis of the 
trend in DALYs with age revealed an initially increasing and then decreasing 
trend. From 1990 to 2019, the burden of disease in different age groups showed a 
downward trend. Among 204 countries, 180 countries showed downward trends, 10 
countries showed upward trends, and the burden was stable in 14 countries. The 
Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between 
sociodemographic index and the age-standardized rates of cervical cancer 
attributable to smoking (ρ=-0.228, P<.001 for ASMR and ρ=-0.223, P<.001 for 
ASDR).
CONCLUSIONS: An increase over time in the absolute number of cervical cancer 
deaths and DALYs attributable to smoking and a decrease over time in the ASMR 
and ASDR for cervical cancer attributable to smoking were observed in the 
overall population, and differences in these variables were also observed 
between countries and regions. More attention should be paid to cervical cancer 
prevention and screening in women who smoke, especially in low- and 
middle-income countries."
1050,"Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been extensively explored as 
prognostic biomarkers and cellular immunotherapy methods in cancer patients. 
However, the prognostic significance of TILs in bladder cancer remains 
unresolved. We evaluated the prognostic effect of TILs in bladder cancer 
patients. Sixty-four bladder cancer patients who underwent surgical resection 
between 2018 and 2020 in Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital were analyzed in 
this study. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate CD3, CD4, CD8, and FoxP3 
expression on TILs in the invasive margin of tumor tissue, and the presence of 
TIL subsets was correlated with the disease-free survival (DFS) of bladder 
cancer patients. The relationship between clinical-pathological features and DFS 
were analyzed. A high level of CD3+TILs (CD3highTILs) (P = 0.027) or negative 
expression of FoxP3 TILs (FoxP3- TILs) (P = 0.016) was significantly related to 
better DFS in bladder cancer patients. Those with CD3highFoxP3- TILs had the 
best prognosis compared to those with CD3highFoxP3+ TILs or CD3lowFoxP3- TILs 
(P = 0.0035). Advanced age [HR 4.57, (1.86-11.25); P = 0.001], CD3low TILs [HR 
0.21, (0.06-0.71); P = 0.012], CD8low TILs [HR 0.34, (0.12-0.94); P = 0.039], 
and FoxP3+ TILs [HR 10.11 (1.96-52.27); P = 0.006] in the invasive margin were 
associated with a worse prognosis (DFS) by multivariate analysis. In conclusion, 
we demonstrated that CD3high, FoxP3-, and CD3highFoxP3- TILs in the invasive 
margin were significantly associated with better DFS. CD8high and CD4high TILs 
in the invasive margin tended to predict better DFS in bladder cancer. Patients 
with CD4highCD8high TILs in the invasive margin were likely to have a better 
prognosis."
1051,"Telomeres are ribonucleoproteins that cap chromosome-ends and their DNA length 
is controlled by counteracting elongation and shortening processes. The budding 
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been a leading model to study telomere DNA 
length control and dynamics. Its telomeric DNA is maintained at a length that 
slightly varies between laboratory strains, but little is known about its 
variation at the species level. The recent publication of the genomes of over 
1000 S. cerevisiae strains enabled us to explore telomere DNA length variation 
at an unprecedented scale. Here, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline (YeaISTY) 
to estimate telomere DNA length from whole-genome-sequences and applied it to 
the sequenced S. cerevisiae collection. Our results revealed broad natural 
telomere DNA length variation among the isolates. Notably, telomere DNA length 
is shorter in those derived from wild rather than domesticated environments. 
Moreover, telomere DNA length variation is associated with mitochondrial 
metabolism, and this association is driven by wild strains. Overall, these 
findings reveal broad variation in budding yeast's telomere DNA length 
regulation, which might be shaped by its different ecological life-styles."
1052,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor that mainly occurs in East 
and Southeast Asia. Although patients benefit from the main NPC treatments 
(e.g., radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy), persistent and recurrent 
diseases still occur in some NPC patients. Therefore, investigating the 
pathogenesis of NPC is of great clinical significance. In the present study, 
replication factor c subunit 4 (RFC4) is a key potential target involved in NPC 
progression via bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, the expression and 
mechanism of RFC4 in NPC were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Our results 
revealed that RFC4 was more elevated in NPC tumor tissues than in normal 
tissues. RFC4 knockdown induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and inhibited NPC cell 
proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, HOXA10 was confirmed as a 
downstream target of RFC4, and the overexpression of HOXA10 attenuated the 
silencing of RFC4-induced cell proliferation, colony formation inhibition, and 
cell cycle arrest. For the first time, this study reveals that RFC4 is required 
for NPC cell proliferation and may play a pivotal role in NPC tumorigenesis."
1053,"Infertility is experienced by 8%-12% of adults in their reproductive period 
globally and has become a prevalent concern. Besides routine therapeutic 
methods, stem cells are rapidly being examined as viable alternative therapies 
in regenerative medicine and translational investigation. Remarkable progress 
has been made in understanding the biology and purpose of stem cells. The 
affected pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are 
further studied for their possible use in reproductive medicine, particularly 
for infertility induced by premature ovarian insufficiency and azoospermia. 
Accordingly, this study discusses current developments in the use of some kinds 
of MSCs such as adipose-derived stem cells, bone marrow stromal cells, umbilical 
cord MSCs, and menstrual blood MSCs. These methods have been used to manage 
ovarian and uterine disorders, and each technique presents a novel method for 
the therapy of infertility."
1054,"BACKGROUND: Fundic gland polyps (FGP) of stomach are benign, while some 
hyperplastic polyps (HP) may harbor dysplasia or malignancy. Conventional white 
light endoscopy (WLE) cannot reliably distinguish FGP from HP. We investigated 
the role of image-enhanced endoscopy in differentiating FGP from HP.
METHODS: Patients with gastric polyps were recruited prospectively. The 
characteristics of the polyps were assessed using WLE and magnification narrow 
band imaging (mNBI). The microsurface, intervening space (IS), and microvascular 
(V) features of polyps were evaluated on mNBI. The pattern characteristic of FGP 
and HP were determined. Histopathology of polyps was the gold standard for 
diagnosis. Finally, in the validation phase, five endoscopists applied the 
characteristic features identified in this study to predict the type of gastric 
polyp and their performance was assessed.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients with a total of 70 gastric polyps (HP-46, FGP-24) 
were included in this study. On mNBI, the pattern characteristic of HP included 
peripheral curved type of white structures forming large circular/villous loops 
(microsurface), enlarged intervening space, and microvessels appearing as dark 
patches in the intervening space (p<0.001 vs. FGP). These were noted in 95.7% 
HP. In contrast, 95.8% FGP had a pattern characterized by 
dotted/elliptical/tubular white structures (microsurface), normal width of 
intervening space, and microvessels surrounding the white structures in a 
network pattern. This IS-V pattern classification had an accuracy of >90% in the 
validation phase with intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.95. The accuracy 
of mNBI was higher than WLE (97.1% vs. 67%) in predicting the type of gastric 
polyp.
CONCLUSIONS: Image-enhanced endoscopy with mNBI (IS-V pattern) performs very 
well in differentiating HP from FGP."
1055,"PURPOSE: Despite curative-intent treatment, recurrence is common for patients 
with colorectal cancer (CRC).  Currently, prediction of disease recurrence and 
prognostication following surgery is based upon vague clinical factors and more 
precise and dynamic biomarkers for risk stratification and treatment decisions 
are urgently needed.  Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising biomarker for 
patients undergoing treatment for resectable CRC.
METHODS: In this review, we provide an overview of the data supporting current 
uses of ctDNA for CRC, including localized CRC and resectable colorectal liver 
metastases (CLM), as well as descriptions of important ongoing clinical trials 
using ctDNA in the care of patients with CRC.
RESULTS: The detection of ctDNA following curative-intent therapy is associated 
with disease recurrence, and multiple trials are investigating its role in 
determining need and duration for adjuvant therapy for localized CRC. In 
addition, ctDNA reliably predicts prognosis for patients with CLM, with trials 
underway studying ctDNA-guided treatment sequencing and intensity.
CONCLUSION: The detection of ctDNA is a sensitive and dynamic biomarker for 
disease recurrence in CRC. Many investigations are underway into ctDNA's 
potential role in surveillance and treatment algorithms, and it has the 
potential to become a critical biomarker to determine individualized strategies 
for treatment sequencing, choice, and duration of therapies."
1056,"Recently, nucleic acid drugs have been considered as promising candidates in 
treatment of various diseases, especially cancer. Because of developing 
resistance to conventional chemotherapy, use of genetic tools in cancer therapy 
appears inevitable. siRNA is a RNAi tool with capacity of suppressing target 
gene. Owing to overexpression of oncogenic factors in cancer, siRNA can be used 
for suppressing those pathways. This review emphasizes the function of siRNA in 
treatment of breast tumor. The anti-apoptotic-related genes including Bcl-2, 
Bcl-xL and survivin can be down-regulated by siRNA in triggering cell death in 
breast cancer. STAT3, STAT8, Notch1, E2F3 and NF-κB are among the factors with 
overexpression in breast cancer that their silencing by siRNA paves the way for 
impairing tumor proliferation and invasion. The oncogenic mechanisms in drug 
resistance development in breast tumor such as lncRNAs can be suppressed by 
siRNA. Furthermore, siRNA reducing P-gp activity can increase drug 
internalization in tumor cells. Because of siRNA degradation at bloodstream and 
low accumulation at tumor site, nanoplatforms have been employed for siRNA 
delivery to suppress breast tumor progression via improving siRNA efficacy in 
gene silencing. Development of biocompatible and efficient nanostructures for 
siRNA delivery can make milestone progress in alleviation of breast cancer 
patients."
1057,"PURPOSE: A 4-weekly schedule of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) has been 
approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Phase II trials 
have suggested interest in a 2-weekly regimen. This study aimed to compare the 
efficacy and safety of these two schedules.
METHODS: Data from MBC patients treated with PLD between 2011 and 2021 were 
retrospectively collected. The objective was to demonstrate the noninferiority 
of the 2-weekly versus the 4-weekly schedule in terms of 6-month 
progression-free survival (PFS). The prespecified noninferiority margin was 
calculated as 1.20. A propensity score to receive either schedule was estimated 
using a gradient boosting algorithm. Survival analyses using Cox regression 
models weighted by the propensity score were performed to compare the schedules.
RESULTS: Among the 192 patients included, 96 (50%) underwent each schedule. The 
median number of previous systemic therapies was 4 (IQR, 3 to 6). Anthracyclines 
were previously given in early breast cancer in 63.9% of patients. The median 
follow-up was 10.0 months (IQR, 5.0 to 20.1). A comparable distribution of 
adverse events was observed. The median PFS was 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.9), 
and the median overall survival was 12.1 months (95% CI, 10.8 to 14.9). The 
weighted hazard ratio for PFS was 1.12 (90% CI, 0.82 to 1.54), including the 
noninferiority boundaries.
CONCLUSION: PLD appeared to be a well-tolerated drug in this heavily pretreated 
MBC population. The efficacy and safety of the 2-weekly schedule did not provide 
any advantage, suggesting no interest in changing the registered regimen."
1058,"PURPOSE: CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) combined with endocrine therapy have 
improved HR + /HER2- metastatic breast cancer (MBC) outcomes. However, it is 
still unclear whether the response to CDK4/6i is similar for all races. 
Therefore, we aimed to assess overall survival (OS) trends stratified by race in 
patients with HR + /HER2- MBC after the approval of CDK4/6i, as part of the 
standard of care, in 2015.
METHODS: We performed a population-based study using the SEER database. Patients 
with HR + /HER2- MBC were divided into two time-based cohorts: 1) pre-CDK4/6i 
era (diagnosed in 2011-2013) and 2) post-CDK4/6i era (diagnosed in 2015-2017). 
We used propensity score matching and identified 2,684 patients in each cohort 
that matched in several characteristics. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to 
estimate 2-year OS. Association between cohort and OS was evaluated using 
marginal Cox proportional hazards models with robust sandwich variance 
estimator. We conducted competing risk analysis to estimate the risk of breast 
cancer death in both cohorts.
RESULTS: The 2-year OS rate was 65% for the post-CDK4/6i era and 62% for the 
pre-CDK4/6i era (stratified log-rank p = 0.025). The 2-year OS for non-Hispanic 
White (NHW) patients improved in the post-CDK4/6i era compared to the 
pre-CDK4/6i era (67% vs. 63%, p = 0.033). However, OS did not improve for 
non-Hispanic Black (NHB) (54% vs. 54%, p = 0.876) or Hispanic (67% vs. 65%, 
p = 0.617) groups. The risk of breast cancer death decreased in the post-CDK4/6i 
era as compared to the pre-CDK4/6i era (2-year risk of breast cancer death: 33% 
vs. 30%, p = 0.015); however, this effect was observed only in NHW (sHR 0.84, 
p = 0.005) women, but not in NHB (sHR 0.94, p = 0.630) or Hispanic (sHR 0.91, 
p = 0.550) women.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that outcomes for HR + /HER2- MBC have improved 
after CDK4/6i were introduced in 2015. However, this effect is primarily driven 
by the improved OS in NHW patients, without significant improvement in OS in NHB 
or Hispanics."
1059,"Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with early onset of chronic 
diseases and reduced life expectancy. The involvement of neighborhood-level 
factors in defining cancer risk and outcomes for marginalized communities has 
been an active area of research for decades. Yet, the biological processes that 
underlie the impact of SES on chronic health conditions, such as cancer, remain 
poorly understood. To date, limited studies have shown that chronic life stress 
is more prevalent in low SES communities and can affect important molecular 
processes implicated in tumor biology such as DNA methylation, inflammation, and 
immune response. Further efforts to elucidate how neighborhood-level factors 
function physiologically to worsen cancer outcomes for disadvantaged communities 
are underway. This review provides an overview of the current literature on how 
socioenvironmental factors within neighborhoods contribute to more aggressive 
tumor biology, specifically in Black U.S. women and men, including the impact of 
environmental pollutants, neighborhood deprivation, social isolation, structural 
racism, and discrimination. We also summarize commonly used methods to measure 
deprivation, discrimination, and structural racism at the neighborhood-level in 
cancer health disparities research. Finally, we offer recommendations to adopt a 
multi-faceted intersectional approach to reduce cancer health disparities and 
develop effective interventions to promote health equity."
1060,"OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia involves several mechanisms, including age-related 
changes, nutritional deficiencies, and inflammation, and is associated with 
unfavorable clinical outcomes. However, the significance of skeletal muscle 
index (SMI) and immune-nutritional status for patients with early-stage 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. This retrospective study was 
performed to investigate associations between preoperative SMI based on computed 
tomography (CT) at the L1 level and immune-nutritional status, and whether these 
factors correlated with surgical outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 386 patients with stage I-II NSCLC who 
underwent curative anatomical pulmonary resection. SMI was assessed on CT at the 
L1 level and patients were divided into low-SMI (n = 97) and high-SMI (n = 289) 
groups. We examined the significance of SMI for postoperative outcomes and 
evaluated correlations between SMI and clinical characteristics, including 
immune-nutritional status.
RESULTS: Low SMI was significantly associated with body mass index and geriatric 
nutritional risk index. Five-year overall survival rate was significantly lower 
in the low-SMI group (66.0%) than in the high-SMI group (82.2%, P = 0.004). 
Multivariate analysis revealed SMI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.850; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.091-3.135; P = 0.022) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) (HR 
2.031; 95% CI 1.231-3.352; P = 0.006) as independent predictors of overall 
survival. Low SMI correlated significantly with postoperative complications 
(P = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: Low preoperative SMI based on CT at the L1 level appears associated 
with poor prognosis and postoperative complications among patients with 
early-stage NSCLC. PNI is also an independent prognostic factor for surgical 
outcomes."
1061,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of traditional Chinese Baduanjin Qigong 
exercises on the physical and psychological recovery of patients with 
nasopharyngeal carcinoma after chemoradiotherapy.
METHODS: Eighty-eight nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients who had completed 
chemoradiotherapy were randomly divided into the Baduanjin intervention group 
(n = 44) and the control group (n = 44). Patients in the intervention group 
practised Baduanjin exercise for 12 weeks, with the frequency of 40 min a day 
and 5 days a week after discharge from the hospital. Participants in the control 
group received usual care. Outcome indicators included quality of life (QOL), 
complications, cancer-related fatigue (CRF), sleep quality, anxiety, and 
depression. The intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations were compared 
using univariate analysis of variance. Partial eta squared was used as a measure 
of the effect size.
RESULTS: A total of 75 patients completed the study. In the intention-to-treat 
analysis, after 12 weeks of exercise intervention, there were significant 
increases in the global FACT-H&N (95% CI = 2.09 to 11.47, ηp2 = 0.088), 
social/family well-being (95% CI = 0.13 to 2.26, ηp2 = 0.055), emotional 
well-being (95% CI = 0.34 to 2.44, ηp2 = 0.074), and head and neck cancer 
subscale scores (95% CI = 0.17 to 3.86, ηp2 = 0.052) in the Baduanjin group 
compared with the control group at the 12th week. In the per-protocol analysis, 
there were significant increases in the global FACT-H&N (95% CI = 4.11 to 11.75, 
ηp2 = 0.190), physical well-being (95% CI: 0.50 to 3.04, ηp2 = 0.096), 
social/family well-being (95% CI: 0.32 to 2.15, ηp2 = 0.090), emotional 
well-being (95% CI: 0.60 to 2.53, ηp2 = 0.125), functional well-being (95% CI: 
0.25 to 2.49, ηp2 = 0.075), and head and neck cancer subscale (95% CI: 1.08 to 
4.08, ηp2 = 0.139) scores in the Baduanjin group compared with the control group 
at the 12th week.
CONCLUSION: The findings in this study indicate that Baduanjin exercise is an 
effective and appropriate intervention for improving quality of life and is 
worthy of recommendation and implementation by oncology nurses in the 
rehabilitation process of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma."
1062,"Evolutionary dynamics allows us to understand many changes happening in a broad 
variety of biological systems, ranging from individuals to complete ecosystems. 
It is also behind a number of remarkable organizational changes that happen 
during the natural history of cancers. These reflect tumour heterogeneity, which 
is present at all cellular levels, including the genome, proteome and phenome, 
shaping its development and interrelation with its environment. An intriguing 
observation in different cohorts of oncological patients is that tumours exhibit 
an increased proliferation as the disease progresses, while the timescales 
involved are apparently too short for the fixation of sufficient driver 
mutations to promote explosive growth. Here, we discuss how phenotypic 
plasticity, emerging from a single genotype, may play a key role and provide a 
ground for a continuous acceleration of the proliferation rate of clonal 
populations with time. We address this question by combining the analysis of 
real-time growth of non-small-cell lung carcinoma cells (N-H460) together with 
stochastic and deterministic mathematical models that capture proliferation 
trait heterogeneity in clonal populations to elucidate the contribution of 
phenotypic transitions on tumour growth dynamics."
1063,"INTRODUCTION: Metformin may provide a therapeutic benefit in different types of 
malignancy.
PURPOSE: We aimed at evaluating the effect of metformin as an adjuvant therapy 
to letrozole on estradiol and other biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of 
breast cancer in overweight and obese postmenopausal women.
METHODS: Seventy-five postmenopausal stages II-III breast cancer female patients 
were assessed for eligibility in an open-labeled parallel pilot study. 
Forty-five patients met the inclusion criteria and were assigned into three 
arms: the lean arm (n = 15) women who received letrozole 2.5 mg/day, the control 
arm (n = 15) overweight/obese women who received letrozole 2.5 mg/day, and the 
metformin arm (n = 15) overweight/obese women who received letrozole 2.5 mg/day 
plus metformin (2000 ± 500 mg/day). The intervention duration was 6 months. 
Blood samples were obtained at baseline and 6 months after intervention for the 
measurement of serum estradiol, leptin, osteocalcin levels, fasting blood 
glucose concentration, and serum insulin.
RESULTS: After the intervention and as compared to the control arm, the 
metformin arm showed a significantly lower ratio to the baseline (significant 
reduction) for estradiol (p = 0.0433), leptin (p < 0.0001), fasting blood 
glucose (p = 0.0128), insulin (p = 0.0360), osteocalcin serum levels 
(p < 0.0001), and the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance 
""HOMA-IR"" value (p = 0.0145). There was a non-significant variation in the 
lactate ratio to the baseline among the three study arms (p = 0.5298).
CONCLUSION: Metformin may exert anti-cancer activity by decreasing the 
circulating estradiol, leptin, and insulin. Metformin might represent a safe and 
promising adjuvant therapy to letrozole in overweight/obese postmenopausal women 
with breast cancer.

important roles in wheat productivity. To identify wheat miRNAs, we constructed 
and sequenced sRNA libraries from leaves and roots of two wheat cultivars 
(RAC875 and Kukri) with many different traits. Given that available miRNA wheat 
complement in the plant-specific database PmiREN ( https://pmiren.com ) does not 
include root tissues and root-associated miRNAs might thus be missing, we 
performed first the prediction of novel miRNAs using the sRNAbench tool. We 
found a total of 150 putatively novel miRNA genes with expression of both arms 
from 289 unique mature sequences and nearly 30% of all miRNA reads in roots 
corresponded to novel miRNAs. In contrast, this figure in leaves dropped to 
under 3%, confirming the undersampling of roots in the complement of known 
miRNAs. By using 120 publicly available wheat datasets, 598 Zea mays small RNA 
libraries, 64 plant species genomes, wheat degradome library, and functional 
enrichment analysis, a subset of novel miRNAs were confirmed as bona-fide 
miRNAs. Of the total 605 miRNAs identified in this study inclusive of 316 known 
miRNAs, 528 miRNAs were shared by both cultivars, 429 miRNAs were shared by both 
root tissues and 329 miRNAs were shared by both leaf tissues. In addition, 32 
miRNAs were specific to Kukri while 45 miRNAs were specific to RAC875. These 
miRNAs had diverse functions, such as regulation of gene transcription, protein 
translation, energy metabolism, and cell cycle progression. Our data provide a 
genome-wide miRNA expression profile in these two wheat cultivars and help 
functional studies of wheat genomics."
1065,"AIM: To describe trends in and characteristics of sedative drug use from 2000 
through 2019 in relation to the introduction of central regulations and new 
drugs.
METHODS: In this descriptive study, we used individual prescription data on the 
entire Danish population from the Danish National Prescription Registry to 
calculate yearly incidence and prevalence of use of benzodiazepines, 
benzodiazepine-related drugs (Z-drugs), melatonin, olanzapine, low-dose 
quetiapine, mianserin/mirtazapine, pregabalin, and promethazine from 2000 
through 2019. From the Danish National Patient Registry, we obtained data on 
drug users' psychiatric and somatic comorbidity.
RESULTS: The use of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs declined gradually from 2000 
through 2019, whereas the newer alternatives, melatonin, low-dose quetiapine, 
pregabalin and promethazine, increased in use, while the use of olanzapine and 
mianserin/mirtazapine was relatively stable. This development was seen in both 
men and women and across all age groups except for hypnotic benzodiazepines 
which showed a steep increase in the oldest age group from 2010. For all 
sedative drugs depression, anxiety, alcohol and misuse disorder, pain and cancer 
were the most prevalent comorbidities. During our study period, the number of 
individuals without any of the selected diagnoses increased.
CONCLUSION: In Denmark different central regulations have influenced 
prescription practice toward more restrictive use of Z-drugs and 
benzodiazepines, except for hypnotic benzodiazepine prescriptions increased 
after the introduction of special palliative care. An increase in use of newer 
sedative drugs, however, indicates that the regulations do not remove the need 
for sedative drugs in the population."
1066,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is an immunologically vulnerable tumor 
entity, and immune checkpoint inhibitors are now widely used to treat patients 
with advanced disease. Whether and to what extent immune responses in ccRCC are 
shaped by genetic alterations, however, is only beginning to emerge. In this 
proof-of-concept study, we performed a detailed correlative analysis of the 
mutational and immunological landscapes in a series of 23 consecutive kidney 
cancer patients. We discovered that a high infiltration with CD8 + T cells was 
not dependent on the number of driver mutations but rather on the presence of 
specific mutational events, namely pathogenic mutations in PTEN or BAP1. This 
observation encouraged us to compare mechanisms of T cell suppression in the 
context of four different genetic patterns, i.e., the presence of multiple 
drivers, a PTEN or BAP1 mutation, or the absence of detectable driver mutations. 
We found that ccRCCs harboring a PTEN or BAP1 mutation showed the lowest level 
of Granzyme B positive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). A multiplex 
immunofluorescence analysis revealed a significant number of CD8 + TILs in the 
vicinity of CD68 + macrophages/monocytes in the context of a BAP1 mutation but 
not in the context of a PTEN mutation. In line with this finding, direct 
interactions between CD8 + TILs and CD163 + M2-polarized macrophages were found 
in BAP1-mutated ccRCC but not in tumors with other mutational patterns. While an 
absence of driver mutations was associated with more CD8 + TILs in the vicinity 
of FOXP3 + Tregs and CD68 + monocytes/macrophages, the presence of multiple 
driver mutations was, to our surprise, not found to be strongly associated with 
immunosuppressive mechanisms. Our results highlight the role of genetic 
alterations in shaping the immunological landscape of ccRCC. We discovered a 
remarkable heterogeneity of mechanisms that can lead to T cell suppression, 
which supports the need for personalized immune oncological approaches."
1067,"Cancer immunotherapy relies on improving T cell effector functions against 
malignancies, but despite the identification of several key transcription 
factors (TFs), the biological functions of these TFs are not entirely 
understood. We developed and utilized a novel, clinically relevant murine model 
to dissect the functional properties of crucial T cell transcription factors 
during anti-tumor responses. Our data showed that the loss of TCF-1 in CD8 T 
cells also leads to loss of key stimulatory molecules such as CD28. Our data 
showed that TCF-1 suppresses surface NKG2D expression on naïve and activated CD8 
T cells via key transcriptional factors Eomes and T-bet. Using both in vitro and 
in vivo models, we uncovered how TCF-1 regulates critical molecules responsible 
for peripheral CD8 T cell effector functions. Finally, our unique genetic and 
molecular approaches suggested that TCF-1 also differentially regulates 
essential kinases. These kinases, including LCK, LAT, ITK, PLC-γ1, P65, ERKI/II, 
and JAK/STATs, are required for peripheral CD8 T cell persistent function during 
alloimmunity. Overall, our molecular and bioinformatics data demonstrate the 
mechanism by which TCF-1 modulated several critical aspects of T cell function 
during CD8 T cell response to cancer. Summary Figure: TCF-1 is required for 
persistent function of CD8 T cells but dispensable for anti-tumor response. 
Here, we have utilized a novel mouse model that lacks TCF-1 specifically on CD8 
T cells for an allogeneic transplant model. We uncovered a molecular mechanism 
of how TCF-1 regulates key signaling pathways at both transcriptomic and protein 
levels. These key molecules included LCK, LAT, ITK, PLC-γ1, p65, ERK I/II, and 
JAK/STAT signaling. Next, we showed that the lack of TCF-1 impacted phenotype, 
proinflammatory cytokine production, chemokine expression, and T cell 
activation. We provided clinical evidence for how these changes impact GVHD 
target organs (skin, small intestine, and liver). Finally, we provided evidence 
that TCF-1 regulates NKG2D expression on mouse naïve and activated CD8 T cells. 
We have shown that CD8 T cells from TCF-1 cKO mice mediate cytolytic functions 
via NKG2D."
1068,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the deadliest form of urological cancer and is 
projected to be the fourth most common neoplasm in the USA in males by 2040. In 
addition to the current poor prognosis with 5-year survival rates hardly 
reaching 15%, the prevalence of resistance to currently available systemic 
therapies has also established an urgent need to develop new treatment 
regimen(s) for advanced RCC. Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is the first 
identified ubiquitin-like modifier and has been intensively studied for its 
central role in innate immunity against intracellular pathogens. However, in 
this study, we identified ISG15 as a novel tumor-associated antigen and 
prognostic marker in RCC. Further, we therapeutically targeted elevated ISG15 
expression by means of a Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-based vaccine, designated 
Lm-LLO-ISG15, in both subcutaneous and orthotopic RCC mouse models. Treatment 
with Lm-LLO-ISG15 resulted in an influx of tumor-infiltrating effector T cells 
and significant anti-tumor efficacy in both subcutaneous and orthotopic RCC 
tumor models. Treatment with Lm-LLO-ISG15 also generated a robust 
interferon-gamma response and attracted a larger pool of polyfunctional T cells 
into the tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the therapeutic efficacy of 
Lm-LLO-ISG15 in RCC is comparable to that of anti-PD-1 and sunitinib, the 
current frontline therapies for RCC patients. Collectively, our work illustrates 
that targeting ISG15 in RCC with a CTL-based immunotherapy such as Lm-LLO-ISG15 
is a promising and potentially translatable therapeutic strategy to enhance 
survival in RCC patients."
1069,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic value of the diffusion kurtosis imaging 
(DKI)-derived parameters D value, K value, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) 
parameter apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI)-detected extramural venous invasion (EMVI) (mrEMVI) in rectal 
cancer patients.
METHODS: Forty patients who underwent MRI for rectal cancer were retrospectively 
evaluated. DKI-derived parameters D and K were measured using the Medical 
Imaging Interaction Toolkit. Conventional ADC values were measured from the 
corresponding DWI images. An experienced radiologist evaluated the mrEMVI status 
on MR images using the mrEMVI scoring system. An independent sample t-test or 
analysis of variance was used to analyze and compare the measurement data. The 
x2 test or Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables. Receiver 
operating characteristic curves were used to assess the diagnostic performance 
of these parameters.
RESULTS: Among the 40 patients, MRI showed positive EMVI in 15 patients and 
negative EMVI in 25 patients. Positive mrEMVI status was associated with age, 
positive circumferential resection margin, pT-stage, lymphovascular invasion 
(LVI), distant metastasis, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level 
(P = 0.004-0.036). The dispersion coefficient (D) values and ADC values were 
significantly higher in the mucinous adenocarcinoma (MC) group than in the 
common adenocarcinoma (AC) group (P = 0.001), while kurtosis coefficient (K) 
values were lower in the MC group than in the AC group (P = 0.022). D values 
were significantly higher in the KRAS-mutated group than in the wild-type group 
(P < 0.05), whereas K values were lower in the KRAS-mutated group than in the 
wild-type group (P < 0.05). All three parameters (D, K, and ADC values) showed 
good diagnostic performance for discriminating MC from AC. Both the D and K 
values showed certain diagnostic performance for discriminating KRAS mutation.
CONCLUSION: DKI-derived parameters, conventional ADC values, and mrEMVI are 
associated with different histopathological prognostic factors. All DKI-derived 
parameters and conventional ADC values may distinguish MC from AC. DKI-derived 
parameters may also be used to discriminate KRAS mutation."
1070,"BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BCa) has a high incidence and recurrence rate 
worldwide. So far, there is no noninvasive detection of BCa therapy and 
prognosis based on urine multi-omics. Therefore, it is necessary to explore 
noninvasive predictive models and novel treatment modalities for BCa.
METHODS: First, we performed protein analysis of urine from five BCa patients 
and five healthy individuals using liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Combining multi-omics data to mine particular and 
sensitive molecules to predict BCa prognosis. Second, urine proteomics data were 
combined with TCGA transcriptome data to select differential genes that were 
specifically highly expressed in urine and tissues. Further, the Lasso equation 
was used to screen specific molecules to construct a noninvasive prediction 
model of BCa. Finally, natural compounds of specific molecules were selected by 
combined network pharmacology and molecular docking to complete molecular 
structure docking.
RESULTS: A noninvasive predictive model was constructed using PSMB5, P4HB, 
S100A16, GET3, CNP, TFRC, DCXR, and MPZL1, specific molecules screened by 
multi-omics, and clinical features, which had good predictive value at 1, 3, and 
5 years of prediction. High expression of these target genes suggests a poor 
prognosis in patients with BCa, and they were mainly involved in cell adhesion 
molecules and the IGF pathway. In addition, the corresponding drugs and natural 
compounds were selected by network pharmacology, and the molecular structure 
7NHT of PSMB5 was found to be well docked to Ellagic acid, a natural compound in 
Hetaoren that we found. The 3D structure 6I7S of P4HB was able to bind to 
Stigmasterol in Shanzha stably, and the structure 6WRV of TFRC as an iron 
transport carrier was also able to bind to Stigmasterol in Shanzha stably. The 
structures 1WOJ, 3D3W, and 6IGW of CNP, DCXR, and MPZL1 can also play an 
important role in combination with the natural compounds (S)-Stylopine, 
Kryptoxanthin, and Sitosterol in Maqianzi, Yumixu, and Laoguancao.
CONCLUSION: The noninvasive prediction model based on urinomics had excellent 
potential in predicting the prognosis of patients with BCa. The multi-omics 
screening of specific molecules combined with pharmacology and compound 
molecular docking can promote the research and development of novel drugs."
1071,"The elevated glutathione (GSH) level in cancer cells contributes to the poor 
response to chemotherapy and necessitates the use of maximum tolerated drug 
doses, leading to myriad side effects. We have developed a biocompatible and 
fluorescently trackable nanosystem, iron(III)-bound nanocarbonaceous polyphenol 
(FeNCP), to modulate the available GSH pool in cancer cells for synergistic 
effects in treatments with a cytotoxic anticancer drug, doxorubicin (Dox). This 
nanosystem was designed using a nanoscale carbon system as a platform to 
generate a GSH-responsive gallic acid-iron complex. The effective interaction 
between FeNCP and GSH was probed in PBS (pH 7.4) and cell lysates using UV-Vis, 
fluorescence spectrophotometry, 1H NMR, flow cytometry, and confocal and 
transmission electron microscopic studies. The concurrent treatment of cancer 
cells with subcytotoxic FeNCP and Dox leads to dose reduction indices of Dox of 
∼6.1 for HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) and 6.7 for B16F0 (melanoma) to kill 
∼50% of the cell population, which is suggestive of the requirement of a 
multifold lower dose of Dox. Notably, this combination was relatively more 
cytotoxic toward cancer cell lines than the model normal cell line, Vero. The 
increased reactive oxygen species levels in combinatorial treatment reveal that 
FeNCP serves as a potential candidate for modulating glutathione activity and 
potentiating cytotoxic effects of Dox. The intelligent multifold design of this 
nanosystem might enable the applicability in optical detection of GSH and 
imaging-assisted surgery in the future, in addition to the potential to advance 
treatment regimens in anticancer chemotherapy."
1072,"Low-molecular-weight hydrogels are attractive scaffolds for drug delivery 
applications because of their modular and facile preparation starting from 
inexpensive molecular components. The molecular design of the hydrogelator 
results in a commitment to a particular release strategy, where either 
noncovalent or covalent bonding of the drug molecule dictates its rate and 
mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative approach using a 
reaction-coupled gelator to tune drug release in a facile and user-defined 
manner by altering the reaction pathway of the low-molecular-weight gelator 
(LMWG) and drug components through an acylhydrazone-bond-forming reaction. We 
show that an off-the-shelf drug with a reactive handle, doxorubicin, can be 
covalently bound to the gelator through its ketone moiety when the addition of 
the aldehyde component is delayed from 0 to 24 h, or noncovalently bound with 
its addition at 0 h. We also examine the use of an l-histidine methyl ester 
catalyst to prepare the drug-loaded hydrogels under physiological conditions. 
Fitting of the drug release profiles with the Korsmeyer-Peppas model 
corroborates a switch in the mode of release consistent with the reaction 
pathway taken: increased covalent ligation drives a transition from a Fickian to 
a semi-Fickian mode in the second stage of release with a decreased rate. 
Sustained release of doxorubicin from the reaction-coupled hydrogel is further 
confirmed in an MTT toxicity assay with MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We 
demonstrate the modularity and ease of the reaction-coupled approach to prepare 
drug-loaded self-assembled hydrogels in situ with tunable mechanics and drug 
release profiles that may find eventual applications in macroscale drug 
delivery."
1073,"Septins are cytoskeletal proteins conserved from algae and protists to mammals. 
A unique feature of septins is their presence as heteromeric complexes that 
polymerize into filaments in solution and on lipid membranes. Although animal 
septins associate extensively with actin-based structures in cells, whether 
septins organize as filaments in cells and if septin organization impacts septin 
function is not known. Customizing a tripartite split-GFP complementation assay, 
we show that all septins decorating actin stress fibers are octamer-containing 
filaments. Depleting octamers or preventing septins from polymerizing leads to a 
loss of stress fibers and reduced cell stiffness. Super-resolution microscopy 
revealed septin fibers with widths compatible with their organization as paired 
septin filaments. Nanometer-resolved distance measurements and single-protein 
tracking further showed that septin filaments are membrane bound and largely 
immobilized. Finally, reconstitution assays showed that septin filaments mediate 
actin-membrane anchoring. We propose that septin organization as octamer-based 
filaments is essential for septin function in anchoring and stabilizing actin 
filaments at the plasma membrane."
1074,"Posterior mediastinal dumb-bell tumours are neurogenic tumours that extend from 
the mediastinum to the intraspinal canal. They represent a surgical challenge 
because they may be resected using a staged or a single-stage approach. Until 
recently, a classic posterolateral thoracotomy was the gold standard for 
surgical resection for the intrathoracic segment. In the meantime, 
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery has gained great acceptance among most 
thoracic surgeons because of the decreased surgical trauma, less operative blood 
loss and fewer postoperative complications and the shorter hospital stays. 
Proper selection of cases for thoracoscopic excision is crucial for ensuring 
good surgical outcomes. Factors such as tumour size, location and presence or 
absence of features suggesting malignancy should be considered. This procedure 
can offer great help in different case scenarios involving posterior mediastinal 
dumb-bell tumours. For giant tumours that will eventually need a thoracotomy, 
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery helps the surgical team to choose an 
optimal site for a tailored thoracotomy incision and rule out any metastatic 
pleura seedings. In cases of small intrathoracic segments of dumb-bell tumours 
(≤ 6-8 cm) that require combined spinal and thoracic procedures in a 
single-stage approach, a combined posterior and video-assisted thoracoscopic 
surgical approach can be implemented for total resection of the tumour."
1075,"Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), which play an important role in tumor initiation 
and progression, have been identified in many cancers. Diallyl trisulfide (DATS) 
is an organosulfur compound extracted from garlic with anticancer activities. 
Nanog is a transcription factor responsible for maintaining the stemness of 
CSCs, but its role in the DATS-induced attenuation of renal CSC properties is 
unknown. In this study, renal CSCs were enriched from human renal cancer cell 
lines 786-O and ACHN cultured in a serum-free medium (SFM). The properties of 
CSCs were analyzed by evaluating the ability of the cells in sphere formation 
and measuring the expression of stem cell markers. We found that downregulation 
of Nanog inhibited renal CSC properties. DATS suppressed renal CSC activities by 
reducing tumorsphere formation, decreasing stem cell markers including Nanog, 
CD44, ALDH1A1, and Oct4, inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. 
We further revealed that overexpression of Nanog reversed the suppressive 
effects of DATS on renal CSCs. Taken together, our results demonstrated that 
DATS inhibited renal CSCs by suppressing Nanog. These novel findings suggested 
that, through Nanog targeting, DATS can potentially be used as an anti-tumor 
agent for renal cancer."
1076,"The rarity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) poses a great challenge to their 
clinical application as reliable ""liquid biopsy"" markers for cancer diagnosis. 
Meanwhile, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) led to a reduced 
efficiency in capturing cells with lost or downregulated epithelial cell 
adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expressions. In this study, we proposed an integrated, 
highly efficient strategy for heterogeneous CTC capture and portable detection 
from the blood of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. First, the 
cellulose wrinkled hydrogel with excellent biocompatibility and high specific 
area was employed as the biointerface to capture heterogeneous CTCs with an 
improved capture efficiency in virtue of dual targeting against epithelial and 
mesenchymal ones. Meanwhile, the strategy of glucometer readout was introduced 
for the quantification of captured CTCs on the same hydrogel interface by a 
detection probe, Au-G-MSN-Apt, which was fabricated via entrapping glucose into 
the amino group functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) framework 
sealed by l-cysteine modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and then linked with 
dual aptamers of EpCAM and Vimentin. The number of captured CTCs on the hydrogel 
could be reflected according to the portable glucose meter (PGM) readings. 
Moreover, it was found that the captured cells maintained a higher viability on 
the hydrogel and could be in situ recultured without releasing from the 
substrate. Finally, this integrated strategy was successfully applied to inspect 
the correlations between the number of heterogeneous CTCs in the blood of NSCLC 
patients with disease stage and whether there was distant metastasis."
1077,"Drug combinations could trigger pharmacological therapeutic effects (TEs) and 
adverse effects (AEs). Many computational methods have been developed to predict 
TEs, e.g. the therapeutic synergy scores of anti-cancer drug combinations, or 
AEs from drug-drug interactions. However, most of the methods treated the AEs 
and TEs predictions as two separate tasks, ignoring the potential mechanistic 
commonalities shared between them. Based on previous clinical observations, we 
hypothesized that by learning the shared mechanistic commonalities between AEs 
and TEs, we could learn the underlying MoAs (mechanisms of actions) and 
ultimately improve the accuracy of TE predictions. To test our hypothesis, we 
formulated the TE prediction problem as a multi-task heterogeneous network 
learning problem that performed TE and AE learning tasks simultaneously. To 
solve this problem, we proposed Muthene (multi-task heterogeneous network 
embedding) and evaluated it on our collected drug-drug interaction dataset with 
both TEs and AEs indications. Our experimental results showed that, by including 
the AE prediction as an auxiliary task, Muthene generated more accurate TE 
predictions than standard single-task learning methods, which supports our 
hypothesis. Using a drug pair Vincristine-Dasatinib as a case study, we 
demonstrated that our method not only provides a novel way of TE predictions but 
also helps us gain a deeper understanding of the MoAs of drug combinations."
1078,"Combination therapy is a promising strategy for confronting the complexity of 
cancer. However, experimental exploration of the vast space of potential drug 
combinations is costly and unfeasible. Therefore, computational methods for 
predicting drug synergy are much needed for narrowing down this space, 
especially when examining new cellular contexts. Here, we thus introduce 
CCSynergy, a flexible, context aware and integrative deep-learning framework 
that we have established to unleash the potential of the Chemical Checker 
extended drug bioactivity profiles for the purpose of drug synergy prediction. 
We have shown that CCSynergy enables predictions of superior accuracy, 
remarkable robustness and improved context generalizability as compared to the 
state-of-the-art methods in the field. Having established the potential of 
CCSynergy for generating experimentally validated predictions, we next 
exhaustively explored the untested drug combination space. This resulted in a 
compendium of potentially synergistic drug combinations on hundreds of cancer 
cell lines, which can guide future experimental screens."
1079,"Transcriptional enhanced associate domains (TEADs) are transcription factors 
that bind to cotranscriptional activators like the yes-associated protein (YAP) 
or its paralog transcriptional coactivator with a PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). 
TEAD·YAP/TAZ target genes are involved in tissue and immune homeostasis, organ 
size control, tumor growth, and metastasis. Here, we report isoindoline and 
octahydroisoindole small molecules with a cyanamide electrophile that forms a 
covalent bond with a conserved cysteine in the TEAD palmitate-binding cavity. 
Time- and concentration-dependent studies against TEAD1-4 yielded second-order 
rate constants kinact/KI greater than 100 M-1 s-1. Compounds inhibited YAP1 
binding to TEADs with submicromolar IC50 values. Cocrystal structures with TEAD2 
enabled structure-activity relationship studies. In mammalian cells, compounds 
suppressed CTGF mRNA levels and inhibited TEAD1-4 transcriptional activity with 
submicromolar IC50 values. Inhibition of TEAD binding to YAP1 in mammalian cells 
was also observed. Several compounds inhibited the cell viability of sarcoma, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, and breast cancer cells with 
single-digit micromolar IC50 values."
1080,"As microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many essential biological processes, their 
abnormal expressions can serve as biomarkers and prognostic indicators to 
prevent the development of complex diseases, thus providing accurate early 
detection and prognostic evaluation. Although a number of computational methods 
have been proposed to predict miRNA-disease associations (MDAs) for further 
experimental verification, their performance is limited primarily by the 
inadequacy of exploiting lower order patterns characterizing known MDAs to 
identify missing ones from MDA networks. Hence, in this work, we present a novel 
prediction model, namely HiSCMDA, by incorporating higher order network 
structures for improved performance of MDA prediction. To this end, HiSCMDA 
first integrates miRNA similarity network, disease similarity network and MDA 
network to preserve the advantages of all these networks. After that, it 
identifies overlapping functional modules from the integrated network by 
predefining several higher order connectivity patterns of interest. Last, a 
path-based scoring function is designed to infer potential MDAs based on network 
paths across related functional modules. HiSCMDA yields the best performance 
across all datasets and evaluation metrics in the cross-validation and 
independent validation experiments. Furthermore, in the case studies, 49 and 50 
out of the top 50 miRNAs, respectively, predicted for colon neoplasms and lung 
neoplasms have been validated by well-established databases. Experimental 
results show that rich higher order organizational structures exposed in the MDA 
network gain new insight into the MDA prediction based on higher order 
connectivity patterns."
1081,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are utilized in a variety of clinical 
settings for the management of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer (mNSCLC). While any organ may be subject to immune-related adverse events 
(irAEs) as a consequence of ICI therapy, hematological irAEs are uncommon. We 
describe a scenario involving a patient with oncogene-addicted mNSCLC who 
experienced the rare, life-threatening complication of hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and cytokine release syndrome following the receipt of 
the IMPower150 regimen (carboplatin/paclitaxel/atezolizumab/bevacizumab) after 
progression on initial tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Malignancy-associated 
HLH, while previously described, is more typically associated with hematological 
rather than solid cancers and has only very recently been reported among 
patients receiving ICIs. While identification of hemophagocytosis on bone marrow 
examination is pathognomonic, this feature is not essential for confirming a 
diagnosis of HLH. Prompt recognition of suspicious laboratory and clinical 
features by medical oncologists and engagement with other relevant disciplines 
is hence critical to ensure optimal management of the condition."
1082,"Naringin, a natural product, can be used as a therapeutic agent due to its low 
systemic toxicity and negligible adverse effect. However, due to its hydrophobic 
nature and thereby low solubility, high-dose treatment is required when used for 
human therapy. Herein, we demonstrate the employment of a metal-organic 
framework (MOF) as a nontoxic loading carrier to encapsulate naringin, and the 
afforded nairngin@MOF composite can serve as a multifunctional bioplatform 
capable of treating Gram-positive bacteria and certain cancers by slowly and 
progressively releasing the encapsulated naringin as well as improving and 
modulating immune system functions through synergy between naringin and the MOF."
1083,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a group of non-coding, covalently uninterrupted 
loop transcripts, most of which remain to be functionally characterized. Here, 
we identified circPDIA4 as an oncogenic circRNA in gastric cancer. Clinically, 
circPDIA4 was significantly upregulated in malignant tissues and associated with 
poor survival of gastric cancer patients. The biogenesis of circPDIA4 was 
mediated by the RNA binding protein Quaking, which bound intron 2 and 4 of PDIA4 
pre-mRNA to promote backsplicing of exons 3 and 4. Elevated expression of 
circPDIA4 promoted distant metastasis in various mouse xenograft models in vivo 
and accelerated cancer cell invasion in vitro. CircPDIA4 functioned through 
distinct oncogenic mechanisms in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Cytoplasmic 
circPDIA4 bound to ERK1/2 and sustained hyper-activation of the MAPK pathway by 
preventing DUSP6-mediated ERK1/2 dephosphorylation. Notably, circPDIA4 depletion 
enhanced the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to ERK inhibitors. In the 
nucleus, circPDIA4 interacted with DHX9 as a decoy and repressed its inhibitory 
functions on circRNA biogenesis to boost expression of multiple oncogenic 
circRNAs, which promoted gastric cancer progression. These findings reveal a 
dual tumor-promoting mechanism for circPDIA4 by regulating oncogenic circRNA 
biogenesis and increasing MAPK activity. CircPDIA4 should be investigated 
further as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in gastric 
cancer."
1084,"Near-infrared circularly polarized light is attractive for wide-ranging 
applications. However, high-performance near-infrared circularly polarized light 
is challenging to realize. Here, we show that left-handed chiral photonic 
cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) films produced from ultrasonicated suspensions 
enable right-handed circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor 
of -0.330 in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II). We present a theoretical 
analysis of the adverse effect of structural defects and luminescence intensity 
heterogeneity on the right-handed circularly polarized luminescence glum inside 
the bandgap and the occurrence of left-handed circularly polarized luminescence 
at the band edges. We demonstrate the potential of the chiral photonic CNC films 
with NIR-II circularly polarized light for cancer cell discrimination. The 
present work identifies key scientific questions in CNC-based circularly 
polarized luminescence materials research."
1085,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and long-term efficacy using 
the multiple overlapping ablation technique with a novel non-cooled microwave 
system in benign symptomatic thyroid nodules.
METHODS: This prospective cohort single-center study collected complication data 
from the start of the procedure to 30 days postoperatively and evaluated the 
safety and effectiveness with a follow-up of 24 months. Ultrasound examinations 
were performed to determine the volume shrinkage during follow-up. Thyroid 
function, cosmetic and symptoms scores, and satisfaction degree were evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 30 symptomatic benign thyroid nodules were treated by 
microwave ablation using a power between 15 and 30 watts depending on the size 
of the nodule to be treated. The volume reduction rates in months 1, 3, 6, 9, 
12, and 24 after ablation were 32%, 59%, 67%, 69%, 73%, and 81%, respectively. 
The mean symptom score and mean cosmetic score before treatment were 4 and 3 
respectively, while after treatment they dropped to 3 and 1 respectively. 
Thyroid function indicators fluctuated in the normal range, and those with 
hyperthyroidism recovered to normal parameters. One case of temporary laryngeal 
paralysis occurred postoperatively and fully recovered in less than 3 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel microwave ablation system presented herein can help 
achieve good clinical success rate in benign thyroid nodules, with a satisfying 
safety profile. The microwave ablation performed with the multiple overlapping 
ablation technique could be a good alternative to surgery and radiofrequency 
ablation in the management of benign thyroid nodules."
1086,"The analysis of whole genomes of pan-cancer data sets provides a challenge for 
researchers, and we contribute to the literature concerning the identification 
of robust subgroups with clear biological interpretation. Specifically, we 
tackle this unsupervised problem via a novel rank-based Bayesian clustering 
method. The advantages of our method are: the integration and quantification of 
all uncertainties related to both the input data and the model; the 
probabilistic interpretation of final results to allow straightforward 
assessment of the stability of clusters leading to reliable conclusions; and the 
transparent biological interpretation of the identified clusters, since each 
cluster is characterized by its top-ranked genomic features. We applied our 
method to RNA-seq data from cancer samples from 12 tumor types from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas. We identified a robust clustering that mostly reflects tissue of 
origin, but also includes pan-cancer clusters. Importantly, we identified three 
pan-squamous clusters composed of a mix of lung squamous cell carcinoma, head 
and neck squamous carcinoma and bladder cancer, with different biological 
functions over-represented in the top genes that characterize the three 
clusters. We also found two novel subtypes of kidney cancer that show different 
prognosis, and we reproduced known subtypes of breast cancer. Taken together, 
our method allows identification of robust and biologically meaningful clusters 
of pan-cancer samples."
1087,"Objective.Develop an anatomical model based on the statistics of the population 
data and evaluate the model for anatomical robust optimisation in head and neck 
cancer proton therapy.Approach.Deformable image registration was used to build 
the probability model (PM) that captured the major deformation from patient 
population data and quantified the probability of each deformation. A cohort of 
20 nasopharynx patients was included in this retrospective study. Each patient 
had a planning CT and 6 weekly CTs during radiotherapy. We applied the model to 
5 test patients. Each test patient used the remaining 19 training patients to 
build the PM and estimate the likelihood of a certain anatomical deformation to 
happen. For each test patient, a spot scanning proton plan was created. The PM 
was evaluated using proton spot location deviation and dose distribution.Main 
results. Using the proton spot range, the PM can simulate small non-rigid 
variations in the first treatment week within 0.21 ± 0.13 mm. For overall 
anatomical uncertainty prediction, the PM can reduce anatomical uncertainty from 
4.47 ± 1.23 mm (no model) to 1.49 ± 1.08 mm at week 6. The 95% confidence 
interval (CI) of dose metric variations caused by actual anatomical deformations 
in the first week is -0.59% ∼ -0.31% for low-risk CTD95, and 0.84-3.04 Gy for 
parotidDmean. On the other hand, the 95% CI of dose metric variations simulated 
by the PM at the first week is -0.52 ∼ -0.34% for low-risk CTVD95, and 0.58 ∼ 
2.22 Gy for parotidDmean.Significance.The PM improves the estimation accuracy of 
anatomical uncertainty compared to the previous models and does not depend on 
the acquisition of the weekly CTs during the treatment. We also provided a 
solution to quantify the probability of an anatomical deformation. The potential 
of the model for anatomical robust optimisation is discussed."
1088,"Applying the emerging molecular networking strategy, an uncommon cembranoid 
orthoester, sarcotortin A (1), featuring a 3/14/8/5-fused scaffold, an unusual 
eunicellane-type diterpenoid, sarcotorolide A (2), and two new biscembranoids, 
ximaolides M and N (7 and 8), along with nine known terpenoids 3-6 and 9-13 were 
isolated from the Hainan soft coral Sarcophyton tortuosum. The structure and 
absolute configuration of all new compounds were established by a combination of 
spectroscopic data, X-ray diffraction analysis, and/or quantum chemical 
computational approaches. The plausible biogenetic relationship among these 
skeletally different terpenoids was proposed and discussed. In in vitro 
bioassay, new compound 7 exhibited a remarkable inhibitory activity against 
protein tyrosine phosphatases 1B (PTP1B) with the IC50 value of 8.06 μM. In 
addition, compounds 4 and 10 displayed significant inhibitory effects on 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages 
cells with the IC50 values of 19.13 and 16.45 μM, respectively. Compound 9 
showed interesting cytotoxicity against H1975, MDA-MB231, A549, and H1299 cancer 
cell lines with IC50 values of 31.59, 34.96, 43.87, and 27.93 μM, respectively."
1089,"BACKGROUND: Anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) is an uncommon malignancy with a 
rising incidence that has a high cure rate in its early stages. There is an 
unmet need for a reliable method to monitor response to treatment and assist in 
surveillance. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing has shown great promise in 
other solid tumors for monitoring disease progression and detecting relapse in 
real time. This study aimed to determine the feasibility and use of personalized 
and tumor-informed ctDNA testing in SCCA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed real-world data from 251 patients (817 plasma 
samples) with stages I-IV SCCA, collected between 11/5/19 and 5/31/22. The tumor 
genomic landscape and feasibility of ctDNA testing was examined for all 
patients. The prognostic value of longitudinal ctDNA testing was assessed in 
patients with clinical follow-up (N = 37).
RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed PIK3CA as the most commonly 
mutated gene, and no associations between mutations and stage. Anytime ctDNA 
positivity and higher ctDNA levels (MTM/mL) were associated with metastatic 
disease (P = .004). For 37 patients with clinical follow-up, median follow-up 
time was 21.0 months (range: 4.1-67.3) post-diagnosis. For patients with stages 
I-III disease, anytime ctDNA-positivity after definitive treatment was 
associated with reduced DFS (HR: 28.0; P = .005).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of personalized and 
tumor-informed ctDNA testing as an adjunctive tool in patients with SCCA as well 
as potential use for detection of molecular/minuteimal residual disease, and 
relapse during surveillance. Prospective studies are needed to better evaluate 
the use of ctDNA testing in this indication."
1090,"Objective.Tissue internal pressure, such as interstitial fluid pressure in solid 
tumors and intramuscular pressure in compartment syndrome, is closely related to 
the pathological state of tissues. It is of great diagnostic value to measure 
and/or monitor the internal pressure of targeted tissues. Because most of the 
current methods for measuring tissue pressure are invasive, noninvasive methods 
are highly desired. In this study, we developed a noninvasive method for 
qualitative assessment of tissue internal pressure based on a combination of two 
ultrasound elasticity imaging methods: strain imaging and shear wave elasticity 
imaging.Approach.The method was verified through experimental investigation 
using two tissue-mimicking phantoms each having an inclusion confined by a 
membrane, in which hydrostatic pressures can be applied and maintained. To 
examine the sensitivity of the elasticity imaging methods to pressure variation, 
strain ratio and shear modulus ratio (SMR) between the inclusion and background 
of phantom were obtained.Main results.The results first experimentally prove 
that pressure, in addition to elasticity, is a contrast mechanism of strain 
imaging, and further demonstrate that a comparative analysis of strain ratio and 
SMR is an effective method for noninvasive tissue internal pressure 
detection.Significance.This work provides a new perspective in interpreting the 
strain ratio data in medical diagnosis, and it also provides a noninvasive 
alternative for assessing tissue internal pressure, which could be valuable for 
the diagnosis of pressure-related diseases."

1092,"Due to its high metastatic potential, malignant melanoma is one of the deadliest 
skin cancers. In melanoma as well as in other cancers, acidification of the 
tumor microenvironment (= TME, inverse pH-gradient) is a well-known driver of 
tumor progression and metastasis. Membrane-bound receptors, such as the 
proton-sensitive GPCR (pH-GPCR) GPR4, are considered as potential initiators of 
the signaling cascades relevant to malignant transformation. In this study, we 
investigated the pH-dependent migration of GPR4 wildtype/overexpressing 
SK-Mel-28 cells by using an impedance-based electrical wounding and migration 
assay and classical Boyden chamber experiments. Migration of GPR4 overexpressing 
SK-Mel-28 cells was enhanced in a range of pH 6.5 - pH 7.5 as compared to 
controls in the impedance-based electrical wounding and migration assay. In 
Boyden chamber experiments, GPR4 overexpression only increased migration at pH 
7.5 in a Matrigel-free setup, but not at pH 6.5. Results indicate that GPR4 is 
involved in the migration of melanoma cells, especially in the tumor periphery, 
and that this process is affected by pH in the TME."

1094,"BACKGROUND: Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder, characterized 
by hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, bone diseases, with or without neurological 
symptoms. Plasma glucosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb1), a highly sensitive and specific 
biomarker for GD, has been used for diagnosis and monitoring the response to 
treatment. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an effective treatment for the 
non-neurologic symptoms of GD. Neuronopathic GD (type 2 and 3) accounts for 
60%-70% of the Asian affected population.
METHODS: We explored combination therapy of ERT followed by hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation (HSCT) and its long-term outcomes in patients with GD type 
3 (GD3).
RESULTS: Four patients with GD3 and one with GD type 1 (GD1) underwent HSCT. The 
types of donor were one matched-related, one matched-unrelated, and three 
haploidentical. The age at disease onset was 6-18 months and the age at HSCT was 
3.8-15 years in the patients with GD3. The latest age at follow-up was 
8-22 years, with a post-HSCT duration of 3-14 years. All patients had successful 
HSCT. Chronic graft-versus-host disease occurred in one patient. The enzyme 
activities were normalized at 2 weeks post HSCT. Lyso-Gb1 concentrations became 
lower than the pathological value. All of the patients are still alive and 
physically independent. Most of them (4/5) returned to school. None of the 
patients with GD3 had seizures or additional neurological symptoms after HSCT, 
but showed varying degrees of cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: ERT followed by HSCT could be considered as an alternative 
treatment for patients with GD3 who have a high risk of fatal neurological 
progression."
1095,"With the increasing incidence of cancer worldwide, the prevention and treatment 
of cancer have garnered considerable scientific attention. Traditional 
chemotherapeutic drugs are highly toxic and associated with substantial side 
effects; therefore, there is an urgent need for developing new therapeutic 
agents. Dietary phytochemicals are important in tumor prevention and treatment 
because of their low toxicity and side effects at low concentrations; however, 
their exact mechanisms of action remain obscure. DNA damage is mainly caused by 
physical or chemical factors in the environment, such as ultraviolet light, 
alkylating agents and reactive oxygen species that cause changes in the DNA 
structure of cells. Several phytochemicals have been shown inhibit the 
occurrence and development of tumors by inducing DNA damage. This article 
reviews the advances in phytochemical research; particularly regarding the 
mechanisms related to DNA damage and provide a theoretical basis for future 
chemoprophylaxis research."
1096,"We present the case of a 38-year-old woman who, in the context of a 22-week

counseling mandatory to rule out hereditary diffuse gastric carcinoma syndrome. 
This rare entity, of autosomal dominant inheritance and closely linked to 
mutations in the CDH1 (in most cases) and CTNNA1 genes, is associated with a 
greater predisposition to develop malignant neoplasms of the breast and stomach. 
Genetic sequencing ruled out hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome.

1097,"Cervical cancer predominately affects women compared to lung, breast and 
endometrial cancer. Premature stage identification and proper treatment of this 
cancer may lead to 100% survival rate. The cervix type is very prominent in the 
detailed diagnosis of cervical cancer. High expertise and experienced 
gynecologist are required for an accurate diagnosis of cervical cancer. To 
reduce their burden, a model is proposed, based on deep learning that 
automatically classifies the cervix types. This paper presents Modified Deep 
Convolutional Neural Networks namely Modified VGG16 (MVGG16), Modified VGG19 
(MVGG19), Modified ResNet50 (MRN50), Modified InceptionV3 (MIV3), and Modified 
InceptionResNetV2 (MIRNV2) for the classification of cervix type images. These 
modified networks are implemented using a Multiclass Support Vector Machine 
classifier. The performance metrics are tabulated and compared with pre-trained 
models. The simulation results show that MIRNV2 achieves the best performance 
compared to other models with an overall Accuracy of 92.91% and a Kappa score of 
0.88. MIRNV2 model also gives better classification accuracy of 96.62% for type 
1, 93.58% for type 2, and 95.61% for type 3 cervix images. Hence, this 
facilitates the application of MIRNV2 as a diagnostic tool to assist the 
gynecologist in the classification of cervix type images."
1098,"Monte Carlo (MC) methods are considered the gold-standard approach to dose 
estimation for normal tissues outside the treatment field (out-of-field) in 
proton therapy. However, the physics of secondary particle production from 
high-energy protons are uncertain, particularly for secondary neutrons, due to 
challenges in performing accurate measurements. Instead, various physics models 
have been developed over the years to reenact these high-energy interactions 
based on theory. It should thus be acknowledged that MC users must currently 
accept some unknown uncertainties in out-of-field dose estimates. In the present 
study, we compared three MC codes (MCNP6, PHITS, and TOPAS) and their available 
physics models to investigate the variation in out-of-field normal tissue 
dosimetry for pencil beam scanning proton therapy patients. Total yield and 
double-differential (energy and angle) production of two major secondary 
particles, neutrons and gammas, were determined through irradiation of a water 
phantom at six proton energies (80, 90, 100, 110, 150, and 200 MeV). 
Out-of-field normal tissue doses were estimated for intracranial irradiations of 
1-, 5-, and 15-year-old patients using whole-body computational phantoms. 
Notably, the total dose estimates for each out-of-field organ varied by 
approximately 25% across the three codes, independent of its distance from the 
treatment volume. Dose discrepancies amongst the codes were linked to the 
utilized physics model, which impacts the characteristics of the secondary 
radiation field. Using developer-recommended physics, TOPAS produced both the 
highest neutron and gamma doses to all out-of-field organs from all examined 
conditions; this was linked to its highest yields of secondary particles and 
second hardest energy spectra. Subsequent results when using other physics 
models found reduced yields and energies, resulting in lower dose estimates. 
Neutron dose estimates were the most impacted by physics model choice, and thus 
the variation in out-of-field dose estimates may be even larger than 25% when 
considering biological effectiveness."
1099,"The combination of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and chemotherapy has shown promise 
for achieving improved cancer treatment outcomes. However, due to the lack of 
synergy rationale, a simple one-plus-one combination therapy remains suboptimal 
in overcoming the obstacles of each treatment approach. Herein, we report a 
nanoplatform consisting of a pH-sensitive ferrocene- and cinnamaldehyde-based 
polyprodrug and a hydrogen peroxide-responsive doxorubicin (DOX) prodrug. Under 
an acidic tumor environment, the cinnamaldehyde polyprodrug will be activated to 
release free cinnamaldehyde, which can increase the intracellular hydrogen 
peroxide level and enhance the Fenton reaction. Subsequently, due to the 
collapse of nanoparticle structures, the DOX prodrug will be released and 
activated under a hydrogen peroxide stimulus. Meanwhile, the quinone methide 
produced during DOX prodrug activation can consume glutathione, an important 
antioxidant, and thus in turn enhance the efficacy of CDT. This design of a 
nanoplatform with dual-prodrug cascade activation provides a promising mutually 
beneficial cooperation mode between chemotherapy and CDT for enhancing antitumor 
efficacy."
1100,"A novel method for detecting miRNA has been developed using a combination of 
duplex-specific nuclease signal amplification (DSNSA) and a catalytic hairpin 
assembly (CHA). In this work, a biotinylated trigger release (BTR) probe with a 
biotin group at the 3'-end and a CHA reaction sequence trigger as an initiator 
(catalyst I) at the 5'-end was designed to hybridize target miRNA. The DSN 
enzyme was introduced to initiate the DSNSA. The miRNA was released to consume 
more BTR probes and amplify the signals. Subsequently, streptavidin-coated 
magnetic beads (SA-MBs) were added to the DSNSA reaction solution to remove 
excess BTR probes that did not hybridize with miRNA, which would then separate 
BTR probes and catalyst-I, to ensure detection with high selectivity and 
sensitivity. The catalyst-I remaining in the solution could trigger the CHA 
reaction to enable signal amplification in the second step. The developed method 
exhibits a sensitive detection limit and excellent selectivity in identifying a 
high sequence homology among family members."
1101,"Triple-negative breast cancer TNBC) is a malignant tumor with high incidence and 
high mortality that threaten the health of women worldwide. Circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) are a new class of noncoding RNAs that participate in the biological 
processes of various tumors, but the regulatory roles of circRNAs in TNBC have 
not been fully elucidated. In this study, the expression and characterization of 
circDUSP1 was detected via quantitative real-time PCR, nuclear-cytoplasmic 
fractionation assay, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Then, in vitro and 
in vivo functional experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of 
circDUSP1 in TNBC. The interaction among circDUSP1, miR-761, DACT2 were 
confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down, and RNA 
immunoprecipitation experiments. We identified the circRNA named circDUSP1 that 
was inversely correlated with tumorigenesis and progression in TNBC. 
Overexpression of circDUSP1 significantly attenuated cell proliferation, 
migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, while increased the 
sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel. In-depth mechanism analysis indicated 
that circDUSP1 acts as an endogenous sponge of miR-761 to reduce its suppression 
on target gene DACT2 expression in TNBC. Upregulation of miR-761 or 
downregulation of DACT2 partially reversed the biological process of TNBC and 
the prognosis of paclitaxel affected by circDUSP1. Taken together, our findings 
revealed a role for the regulation of the miR-761/DACT2 axis by circDUSP1 in the 
biological process of TNBC. These results provided new insights into the 
biological mechanism and targeted therapy of TNBC."
1102,"Endometrial carcinoma is a common gynecological malignant tumor, small nucleolar 
RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in cancer development. However, researches on the 
roles of snoRNAs in endometrial carcinoma are limited. The expression levels of 
snoRNAs in endometrial cancer tissues were analyzed using The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) database. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and plasmids were used 
for transfection. Moreover, CCK-8, EdU, wound-healing assay, transwell, cell 
apoptosis, western blotting, and xenograft model were employed to examine the 
biological functions of related molecules. real-time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to detect 
messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Including bioinformatics, fluorescence 
in situ hybridization, RNA pulldown, actinomycin D and RTL-P assays were also 
carried out to explore the molecular mechanism. Analysis of data from TCGA 
showed that the expression level of small nucleolar RNA, C/D box 60 (SNORD60) in 
endometrial cancer tissues is observably higher than that in normal endometrial 
tissues. Further research suggested that SNORD60 played a carcinogenic role both 
in vitro and in vivo, and significantly upregulated the expression of PIK3CA. 
However, the carcinogenic effects can be reversed by knocking down fibrillarin 
(FBL) or PIK3CA. SNORD60 forms complexes by binding with 2'-O-methyltransferase 
fibrillarin, thus catalyzes the 2'-O-methylation (Nm) modification of PIK3CA 
mRNA and modulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, so as to promote the 
development of endometrial cancer. In short, SNORD60 might become a new 
biomarker for the therapy of endometrial cancer in the future and provide new 
strategies for diagnosis and treatment."
1103,"Glutamine addiction is an important phenotype displayed in some types of cancer. 
In these cells, glutamine depletion results in a marked reduction in the 
aggressive cancer phenotype. Mesothelioma is an extremely aggressive disease 
that lacks effective therapy. In this study, we show that mesothelioma tumors 
are glutamine addicted suggesting that glutamine depletion may be a potential 
therapeutic strategy. We show that glutamine restriction, by removing glutamine 
from the medium or treatment with inhibitors that attenuate glutamine uptake 
(V-9302) or conversion to glutamate (CB-839), markedly reduces mesothelioma cell 
proliferation, spheroid formation, invasion, and migration. Inhibition of the 
SLC1A5 glutamine importer, by knockout or treatment with V-9302, an SLC1A5 
inhibitor, also markedly reduces mesothelioma cell tumor growth. A relationship 
between glutamine utilization and YAP1/TEAD signaling has been demonstrated in 
other tumor types, and the YAP1/TEAD signaling cascade is active in mesothelioma 
cells and drives cell survival and proliferation. We therefore assessed the 
impact of glutamine depletion on YAP1/TEAD signaling. We show that glutamine 
restriction, SLC1A5 knockdown/knockout, or treatment with V-9302 or CB-839, 
reduces YAP1 level, YAP1/TEAD-dependent transcription, and YAP1/TEAD target 
protein (e.g., CTGF, cyclin D1, COL1A2, COL3A1, etc.) levels. These changes are 
observed in both cells and tumors. These findings indicate that mesothelioma is 
a glutamine addicted cancer, show that glutamine depletion attenuates YAP1/TEAD 
signaling and tumor growth, and suggest that glutamine restriction may be useful 
as a mesothelioma treatment strategy."
1104,"Monoallelic or biallelic RAD51C germline mutations results in chromosome 
instability disorders such as fanconi anemia (FA) and cancers. The bona fide 
function of RAD51C is to assist RAD51 nucleoprotein filament onto single strand 
DNA to complete Homologous Recombination (HR) repair. In addition to HR repair, 
the role of RAD51C in DNA replication is emerging when replication forks are 
transiently or irreversibly stalled. We identified novel RAD51C variants of 
uncertain significance (VUS) from breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and gastric 
cancer patients and functionally characterized the effect of these variants in 
replication fork protection and double-strand breaks (DSB's) repair. In RAD51C 
deficient chinese hamster CL-V4B cells, expression of RAD51C F164S, A87E, L134S 
and E49K variants heightened sensitivity to mitomycin C (MMC), etoposide and 
PARP inhibition. Differently, expression of a subset RAD51C variants R24L, R24W, 
and R212H displayed mild sensitivity to MMC, etoposide and PARP inhibition. 
Further functional characterization of a subset of variants revealed that Rad51C 
F164S, A87E, L134S and E49K variants displayed reduced RAD51 foci formation and 
increased overall nuclear single strand DNA levels in the presence of 
replication stress. Additionally, DNA fiber assay revealed that RAD51C F164S, 
A87E, L134S and E49K variants displayed defective replication fork protection 
upon prolonged fork stalling. Investigations using patient-derived 
lymphoblastoid cell line carrying heterozygous RAD51C L134S variant showed an 
impairment in RAD51 chromatin association and replication fork protection, 
suggestive of deleteriousness of this VUS variant. Overall, our findings provide 
more insights into molecular roles of RAD51C in replication fork integrity 
maintenance and in DSB repair. Disclosure Summary The authors report no relevant 
conflicts of interest in this work."
1105,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral small-vessel disease may alter cerebral blood 
flow (CBF) leading to brain changes and, hence, cognitive impairment and 
dementia. CBF and the spatial coefficient of variation can be measured 
quantitatively by arterial spin-labeling. We aimed to investigate the 
associations of demographics, vascular risk factors, location, and severity of 
cerebral small-vessel disease as well as the etiologic subtypes of cognitive 
impairment and dementia with CBF and the spatial coefficient of variation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred ninety patients with a diagnosis of no 
cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment no dementia, vascular cognitive 
impairment no dementia, Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia were recruited 
from the memory clinic. Cerebral microbleeds and lacunes were categorized into 
strictly lobar, strictly deep, and mixed-location and enlarged perivascular 
spaces into the centrum semiovale and basal ganglia. Total and region-specific 
white matter hyperintensity volumes were segmented using FreeSurfer. CBF (n = 
333) and the spatial coefficient of variation (n = 390) were analyzed with 
ExploreASL from 2D-EPI pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling images in white 
matter (WM) and gray matter (GM). To analyze the effect of demographic and 
vascular risk factors as well as the location and severity of cerebral 
small-vessel disease markers on arterial spin-labeling parameters, we 
constructed linear regression models, whereas logistic regression models were 
used to determine the association between arterial spin-labeling parameters and 
cognitive impairment no dementia, vascular cognitive impairment no dementia, 
Alzheimer disease, and vascular dementia.
RESULTS: Increasing age, male sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of 
heart disease, and smoking were associated with lower CBF and a higher spatial 
coefficient of variation. Higher numbers of lacunes and cerebral microbleeds 
were associated with lower CBF and a higher spatial coefficient of variation. 
Location-specific analysis showed mixed-location lacunes and cerebral 
microbleeds were associated with lower CBF. Higher total, anterior, and 
posterior white matter hyperintensity volumes were associated with a higher 
spatial coefficient of variation. No association was observed between enlarged 
perivascular spaces and arterial spin-labeling parameters. A higher spatial 
coefficient of variation was associated with the diagnosis of vascular cognitive 
impairment no dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced CBF and an increased spatial coefficient of variation were 
associated with cerebral small-vessel disease, and more specifically lacunes, 
whereas cerebral microbleeds and white matter hyperintensities were associated 
with WM-CBF and GM spatial coefficient of variation. The spatial coefficient of 
variation was associated with cognitive impairment and dementia, suggesting that 
hypoperfusion might be the key underlying mechanism for vascular brain damage."

1107,"OBJECTIVES: Cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs) have shown promising 
preclinical activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, clinical 
trials have not demonstrated effects on inflammation. This study aims to analyze 
changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and adverse events in IBD 
patients prescribed CBMPs.
METHODS: A case series from the UK Medical Cannabis Registry was performed. 
Primary outcomes included changes from baseline in the Short Inflammatory Bowel 
Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), 
Single-Item Sleep Quality Scale (SQS), and EQ-5D-5L Index score at 1 and 
3 months. Statistical significance was defined using p < 0.050.
RESULTS: Seventy-six patients with Crohn's disease (n = 51; 67.11%) and 
ulcerative colitis (n = 25; 32.89%) were included. The median baseline SIBDQ 
score improved at 1 and 3 months. EQ-5D-5L index values, GAD-7, and SQS also 
improved after 3 months (p < 0.050). Sixteen (21.05%) patients reported adverse 
events with the majority being classified as mild to moderate in severity.
CONCLUSION: Patients treated with CBMPs for refractory symptoms of Crohn's 
disease and ulcerative colitis demonstrated a short-term improvement in 
IBD-specific and general HRQoL. Prior cannabis consumers reported greater 
improvement compared to cannabis-naïve individuals."
1108,"Seas and oceans have been explored for the last 70 years in search of new 
compounds that can support the battle against cancer. Marine polysaccharides can 
act as nanomaterials for medical applications and marine-derived bioactive 
compounds can be applied for the biosynthesis of metallic and nonmetallic 
nanoparticles. Nanooncology can be used in numerous fields including 
diagnostics, serving as drug carriers or acting as drugs. This review focuses on 
marine-derived nanoparticles with potential oncological applications. It 
classifies organisms used for nanoparticle production, explains the production 
process, presents different types of nanoparticles with prospective applications 
in oncology, describes the molecular pathways responsible for numerous 
nanomedicine applications, tags areas of nanoparticle implementation in oncology 
and speculates about future directions."
1109,"OBJECTIVES: Compared with the general population, patients with sickle cell 
disease (SCD) typically have substantially reduced life expectancies. It is 
unclear whether SCD patients who acquire COVID-19 have higher rates of 
complications and mortality than the general population. We sought to elucidate 
COVID-19 presentation and outcomes in patients with SCD.
METHODS: Using retrospective chart review, we evaluated demographic 
characteristics, presenting symptoms, chest imaging findings, blood transfusion 
requirements, need for mechanical ventilation or pressor support, medication 
administration (including remdesivir and dexamethasone), and survival among 
individuals with SCD hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 2020 to December 
2021.
RESULTS: Among 72 SCD patients, increased pain was the most common presenting 
symptom followed by cough, fever, and dyspnea. Thirty-seven (44%) received 
simple transfusion and 14 (17%) underwent exchange transfusion. Lung imaging 
findings suggestive of COVID-19 were observed in 27 (37%) patients; 21 (29%) 
patients were treated with remdesivir and 26 (35%) received dexamethasone. Three 
patients (4%) required mechanical ventilation and pressor support; all three 
died from COVID complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Pain is the most common presenting symptom in SCD patients with 
COVID-19. We observed a mortality rate higher than that among the general 
population among patients who required mechanical ventilation and pressor 
support."
1110,"INTRODUCTION: In view of other candidate proteins from the cathepsin family of 
proteases holding great potential in being targeted during cancer therapy, the 
importance of Cathepsin B (CtsB) stands out as being truly exceptional. Based on 
its contribution to oncogenesis, its intimate connection with regulating 
apoptosis and modulating extracellular and intracellular functions through its 
secretion or compartmentalized subcellular localization, collectively highlight 
its complex molecular involvement with a myriad of normal and pathological 
regulatory processes. Despite its complex functional nature, CtsB is emerging as 
one of the few cathepsin proteases that has been extensively researched to yield 
tangible outcomes for cancer therapy.
AREAS COVERED: In this article, we review the scientific literature which has 
justified or shaped the importance of CtsB expression in cancer progression, 
from the perspective of highlighting a paradigm that is rapidly changing from 
basic research towards a broader clinical and translational context.
EXPERT OPINION: In doing so, we detail its maturation as a diagnostic marker 
through describing the development of CtsB-specific Activity-Based Probes, the 
rapid evolution of these towards a new generation of Prodrugs, and the 
evaluation of these in model systems for their therapeutic potential as 
anti-cancer agents in the clinic."
1111,"Emerging evidence has suggested that circular RNAs (circRNAs) have vital 
functions during the initiation and progression of various diseases. However, 
circRNA potential mechanisms in colorectal cancer (CRC) are largely unknown. 
Here, we sought to investigate the role and underlying regulatory mechanism of 
circ0104103 in CRC. circ0104103 was validated by quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Sanger sequencing. Gain- and 
loss-of-function assays in cell lines and mouse xenograft models were utilized 
to investigate the effects of circ0104103 in CRC. RNA pull-down assays, RNA 
immunoprecipitation assays, bioinformatics analyses, RNA fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) and luciferase reporter assays were used to elucidate the 
potential mechanism of circ0104103 in CRC. We identified circ0104103, which is 
strongly downregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines. Functional studies 
revealed that circ0104103 inhibited CRC cell growth, migration and invasion both 
in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circ0104103 binds to HuR, a functional 
RNA-binding protein (RBP) commonly expressed in CRC. HuR binds to the 3'UTR of 
LACTB mRNA to facilitate stabilization and increase its expression. Moreover, 
circ0104103 was verified as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) via negative 
regulation of miR-373-5p to increase LACTB expression, resulting in inhibiting 
the occurrence and progression of CRC. Taken together, our study revealed that 
circ0104103 acts as a tumour suppressor and may be a novel biomarker and 
therapeutic target in CRC."
1112,"Prometastatic and antitumor effects of different anesthetics have been 
previously analyzed in several studies with conflicting results. Thus, the 
underlying perioperative molecular mechanisms mediated by anesthetics 
potentially affecting tumor phenotype and metastasis remain unclear. It was 
hypothesized that anesthetic‑specific long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) expression 
changes are induced in the blood circulation and play a crucial role in tumor 
outcome. In the present study, high‑throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR 
were performed in order to identify lncRNA and mRNA expression changes affected 
by two therapeutic regimes, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and volatile 
anesthetic gas (VAG) in patients undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC) resection. 
Total blood RNA was isolated prior to and following resection and characterized 
using RNA sequencing. mRNA‑lncRNA interactions and their roles in cancer‑related 
signaling of differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified using 
bioinformatics analyses. The comparison of these two time points revealed 35 
differentially expressed lncRNAs in the TIVA‑group, and 25 in the VAG‑group, 
whereas eight were shared by both groups. Two lncRNAs in the TIVA‑group, and 23 
in the VAG‑group of in silico identified target‑mRNAs were confirmed as 
differentially regulated in the NGS dataset of the present study. Pathway 
analysis was performed and cancer relevant canonical pathways for TIVA were 
identified. Target‑mRNA analysis of VAG revealed a markedly worsened 
immunological response against cancer. In this proof‑of‑concept study, 
anesthesic‑specific expression changes in lncRNA and mRNA profiles in blood were 
successfully identified. Moreover, the data of the present study provide the 
first evidence that anesthesia‑induced lncRNA pattern changes may contribute 
further in the observed differences in CRC outcome following tumor resection."
1113,"High glycolytic activity of cancer cells leads to lactic acidosis (LA) in the 
tumor microenvironment. LA is not merely a consequence of metabolic activities, 
but also has functional roles in metabolic reprogramming and cancer progression. 
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells exhibit a high dependency on glycolysis for 
survival and growth, but the specific effects of LA on cellular characteristics 
remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that long-term LA (LLA) reprograms the 
metabolic phenotype of CCA cells from glycolytic to oxidative, and enhances 
their migratory activity. In CCA cell culture, short-term LA (SLA, 24 h) showed 
a growth inhibitory effect, while extended LA exposure for more than two weeks 
(LLA) led to enhanced cell motility. Coincidentally, LLA enhanced the 
respiratory capacity with an increase in mitochondrial mass. Inhibition of 
mitochondrial function abolished LLA-induced cell motility, suggesting that 
metabolic remodeling affects the phenotypic outcomes. RNA-sequencing analysis 
revealed that LLA upregulated genes associated with cell migration and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), 
which encodes a pro-EMT-secreted protein. Inhibition of THBS1 resulted in the 
suppression of both LLA-induced cell motility and respiratory capacity. 
Moreover, high THBS1 expression was associated with poor survival in patients 
with CCA. Collectively, our study suggests that the increased expression of 
THBS1 by LLA promotes phenotypic alterations leading to CCA progression."
1114,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. The 
complete burden and outcomes in Uganda are unknown. The study was a multicenter 
retrospective chart review of children aged between 0 to 15 years diagnosed with 
NB from 2010 to 2020. Demographic, clinical and tumor-related characteristics 
were extracted for analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression 
models were used to determine the one-year overall survival (OS) and identify 
prognostic factors. Seventy-five patients were evaluated, with a median age at 
diagnosis of 48 months (IQR 26-108 months). Fever (74.7%), weight loss (74.7%), 
high blood pressure (70.3%) and abdominal swelling/mass (65.3%) were the most 
common features at diagnosis. Suprarenal tumors (52%) and stage 4 disease 
(70.7%) were also common. The one-year OS was 60.0% (95%CI 56.8%; 64.3%) with a 
median survival time of 12.6 months (95% CI: 8.1; 20.8). The one-year OS for 
non-metastatic and metastatic disease was 67.3% and 42.6% (p = 0.11) 
respectively. Leukocytosis (p < 0.001) at diagnosis was of prognostic 
significance while clinical remission after induction chemotherapy (p < 0.001) 
provided survival advantages. Children who received maintenance chemotherapy had 
a longer median survival time of 38.5 months (range 10.8-69.5). Age (p = 0.001), 
lung metastasis (p < 0.001), and leukocytosis (p < 0.001) remained significant 
on multivariate analysis. In this Ugandan study, leukocytosis was a clinical 
predictor of prognosis, metastatic disease had management challenges and 
maintenance chemotherapy prolonged the survival time but not OS."
1115,"Plasmonic nanovesicles show broad applications in areas such as cancer 
theranostics and drug delivery, but the preparation of nanovesicles from shaped 
nanoparticles remains challenging. This article describes the vesicular 
self-assembly of shaped nanoparticles, such as gold nanocubes grafted with 
amphiphilic block copolymers, in selective solvents. The nanocubes assembled 
within the vesicular membranes exhibit two distinctive packing modes, namely 
square-like and hexagonal packing, depending on the relative dimensions of the 
copolymer ligands and nanocubes. The corresponding optical properties of the 
plasmonic nanovesicles can be tuned by varying the length of the grafted 
copolymers and the size of the nanocubes. This work provides guidance for the 
fabrication of functional plasmonic vesicles for applications in catalysis, 
nanomedicines and optical devices."
1116,"Tumor is the major cause of death all around the world in recent days. Early 
detection and prediction of a cancer type are important for a patient's 
well-being. Functional genomic data has recently been used in the effective and 
early detection of cancer. According to previous research, the use of microarray 
data in cancer prediction has evidenced two main problems as high dimensionality 
and limited sample size. Several researchers have used numerous statistical and 
machine learning-based methods to classify cancer types but still, limitations 
are there which makes cancer classification a difficult job. Deep Learning (DL) 
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been proven with effective analyses 
of unstructured data including gene expression data. In the proposed method gene 
expression data for five types of cancer is collected from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA). Prominent features are selected using a hybrid Particle Swarm 
Optimization (PSO) and Random Forest (RF) algorithm followed by the use of 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Finally, for 
classification blend of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bi-directional 
Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) is used to predict the target type of cancer. 
Experimental results demonstrate that accuracy of the proposed method is 96.89%. 
As compared to existing work, our method outperformed with better results."
1117,"The use of small molecule kinase inhibitors, which target specific enzymes that 
are overactive in cancer cells, has revolutionized cancer patient treatment. To 
treat some types of breast cancer, CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as palbociclib, have 
been developed that target the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor 
suppressor gene. Acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors may be due to 
activation of the AKT pro‑survival signaling pathway that stimulates several 
processes, such as growth, metastasis and changes in metabolism that support 
rapid cell proliferation. The aim of the present study was to investigate 
whether targeting ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), a downstream target of AKT, may 
combine with CDK4/6 inhibition to inhibit tumorigenesis. The present study 
determined that ACLY is activated in breast and pancreatic cancer cells in 
response to palbociclib treatment and AKT mediates this effect. Inhibition of 
ACLY using bempedoic acid used in combination with palbociclib reduced cell 
viability in a panel of breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. This effect was 
also observed using breast cancer cells grown in 3D cell culture. 
Mechanistically, palbociclib inhibited cell proliferation, whereas bempedoic 
acid stimulated apoptosis. Finally, using Transwell invasion assays and 
immunoblotting, the present study demonstrated that ACLY inhibition blocked cell 
invasion, when used alone or in combination with palbociclib. These data may 
yield useful information that could guide the development of future therapies 
aimed at the reduction of acquired resistance observed clinically."
1118,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a frequent malignant tumor of the 
kidney which has a dismal prognosis. At present, targeted therapies and 
immunotherapy have achieved significant results; however, the overall survival 
rate of patients with ccRCC remains unacceptably poor. It is therefore necessary 
to find novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets for ccRCC. It has been reported 
that enolase 2 (ENO2) is an oncogene, although its function in the immune 
microenvironment and in the growth of ccRCC has yet to be fully elucidated. The 
present study analyzed the data of patients with ccRCC both from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, and from 
clinical samples obtained from Third Affiliated Hospital of the Second Military 
Medical University to investigate the role of ENO2 in the progression of ccRCC 
and the correlation between ENO2 and certain clinical features. It was found 
that the expression of ENO2 was elevated both in patients with ccRCC retrieved 
from the GEO and TCGA databases and in clinical ccRCC samples obtained from 
Third Affiliated Hospital of the Second Military Medical University. In 
addition, the prognosis of patients was poorer when ENO2 was highly expressed. 
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) confirmed 
that ENO2 participated in the regulation of various pathways in ccRCC. In vitro 
experiments including Cell Counting Kit‑8 cell proliferation assay, Transwell 
and Matrigel assays confirmed that ENO2 could promote the proliferation and 
migration of ccRCC cells. Furthermore, a number of immunosuppressive indicators 
were identified that positively correlated with ENO2 expression. In conclusion, 
the present study revealed that ENO2 expression promotes the proliferation, 
invasion and migration of ccRCC cells, and may serve as a novel predictor to 
evaluate prognosis and the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade treatment for 
patients with ccRCC."
1119,"Fluoropyrimidines (FP) are the backbone chemotherapy in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
treatment; however, their use is associated with cardiotoxicity, which is 
underreported. In the present study, it was aimed to prospectively determine the 
incidence rates and related risk factors of FP‑induced cardiotoxicity (FIC) in 
CRC patients and at identifying predictive biomarkers. A total of 129 
consecutive previously untreated CRC patients underwent active cardiological 
monitoring, including 5‑items simplified questionnaire on symptoms, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) and plasma sample collection during FP chemotherapy. FIC 
was defined as the presence of ECG alterations and/or the arising of at least 
one symptom of chest pain, dyspnoea, palpitations or syncope. The primary 
objective was the evaluation of FIC incidence. Secondary objectives were the 
correlation of FIC with well‑known cardiological risk factors and the 
identification of circulating biomarkers (serum levels of troponin I, pro 
hormone BNP; miRNA analysis) as predictors of FIC. A total of 20 out of 129 
(15.5%) patients experienced FIC. The most common symptoms were dyspnoea (60%) 
and chest pain (40%), while only 15% of patients presented ECG alterations, 
including one acute myocardial infarction. Retreatment with FP was attempted in 
90% of patients with a favourable outcome. Despite 48% of patients having 
cardiological comorbidities, an increased FIC was not observed in this subgroup. 
Only the subgroup of females with the habit of alcohol consumption showed an 
increased risk of FIC. None of the circulating biomarkers evaluated demonstrated 
a clinical utility as FIC predictors. FIC can be an unexpected, life‑threatening 
adverse event that can limit the subsequent treatment choices in patients with 
CRC. In this prospective study, well‑known cardiological comorbidities were not 
related to higher FIC risk and circulating biomarkers predictive of toxicity 
could not be found. With careful monitoring, mainly based on symptoms, almost 
all patients completed the FP treatment."
1120,"Biliary cancer has a poor prognosis due to a lack of specific biomarkers and 
difficulty in diagnosis. The present study aimed to identify serum tumor markers 
for the diagnosis of biliary cancer via serological identification of antigens 
by recombinant cDNA expression cloning. Wingless‑type MMTV integration site 
family, member 7 (WNT7B) was identified as a target antigen, suggesting the 
presence of serum antibodies against this antigen. Deletion mutants were then 
prepared to evaluate the response to serum antibodies. When serum antibody 
levels against WNT7B deletion mutants (WNT7B-92‑2, -92‑260, 2-260 and 184-260) 
were examined using amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay‑linked 
immunosorbent assay, the levels of the antibody against WNT7B with amino acids 
184‑260 were higher in patients with biliary cancer than in healthy donors. 
Therefore, the region covering residues 184‑260 of WNT7B was decomposed to 
generate seven peptides, and the levels of antibodies against these peptides 
were measured. Among them, the levels of antibodies against WNT7B234‑253 and 
WNT7B244‑260 were higher in patients with biliary cancers than in healthy donors 
(WNT7B234‑253, P=0.0009; WNT7B244‑260, P=0.0005). The levels of the antibody 
against the former were specifically high in patients with biliary cancer but 
not in those with esophageal, gastric, colorectal, pancreatic, or breast cancer. 
Furthermore, analysis by the cutoff value of WNT7B234‑253 defined by ROC showed 
a high sensitivity of 70% in patients with biliary cancer. Therefore, the serum 
levels of the antibody against WNT7B234‑253 may be useful as a marker for 
biliary cancer diagnosis."
1121,"EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been successfully used in lung 
cancer treatment. Nevertheless, tumor cells may develop resistant phenotypes in 
the tumor microenvironment after a period of treatment with any generation of 
EGFR TKIs. Macrophages play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis and development. At 
the same time, macrophages renew continuously, and their polarized phenotype 
changes dynamically. Although macrophage polarization is generally considered to 
be involved in secondary resistance, it would be time consuming if renewed 
macrophages would only protect tumor cells from drug attacks after polarization. 
It is unclear how dynamic renewal of macrophage contributes to acquired 
resistance. By using two co‑culture approaches, the present study modeled two 
types of renewal of macrophages: Migrated macrophages (Mm) and locally 
self‑renewal resident macrophages (Mr). The EGFR‑mutant lung cancer cell line 
PC‑9 was induced to develop resistance to gefitinib in these co‑culture 
approaches and without macrophages co‑culture. PC‑9 cells induced in Mm 
co‑culture recovered fast from gefitinib attack, and formed the gefitinib 
resistant (GR) subline PC‑9/Mm/GR with the strongest resistant ability. 
PC‑9/Mm/GR cells exhibited epithelial characteristics, including stable 
expression of EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR, insulin‑like growth factor 1 receptor, 
TGF‑βII receptor and E‑cadherin. PC‑9 cells induced in Mr co‑culture and those 
without co‑culture developed similar weak resistance to gefitinib. TGF‑β 
secretion was inhibited when PC‑9 cells were in Mr co‑culture, but not in Mm 
co‑culture. Macrophages were not polarized in either co‑culture type. The 
present findings suggested that macrophages may affect resistance acquirement by 
different renewal modes. Mm could promote resistance acquirement by stabilizing 
tumor cell phenotypes, which would happen before polarization. It would be 
helpful to monitor the response to EGFR‑TKIs and design novel treatment 
strategies if macrophages from two renewal modes were distinguished effectively."
1122,"The function of human dicarbonyl/L‑xylulose reductase (DCXR) in the 
pathophysiology of breast cancer is yet to be elucidated. The present study 
aimed to investigate the function of DCXR in glycolysis and the cell cycle of 
breast cancer cells with respect to cell proliferation. Differential expressed 
DCXR was identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and verified in 
clinical breast cancer tissue. DCXR silencing and overexpression were induced by 
RNA interference and lentiviral vectors, respectively. Cell cycle progression, 
proliferation and glycolytic activity of breast cancer cells were detected by 
flow cytometry, Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay and chemical methods, respectively. 
Tumorigenicity was detected using nude mice xenograft models. The expression of 
DCXR was increased in TCGA breast cancer database and the function of DCXR was 
enriched in 'glycolysis' and 'cell cycle'. Further analysis using clinical 
breast cancer samples confirmed upregulation of DCXR. The silencing of DCXR 
suppressed proliferation and cell cycle progression of breast cancer cells and 
significantly decreased the capacity for glycolysis, thereby demonstrating the 
effect of DCXR on the function of breast cancer cells. Similar conclusions were 
obtained in DCXR overexpressing cells; notably, DCXR overexpression promoted 
proliferation, cell cycle progression at S phase and glycolysis. 
2‑Deoxy‑D‑glucose inhibited the effect of DCXR on the proliferation and cell 
cycle progression of breast cancer cells. The present study revealed that DCXR 
regulated breast cancer cell cycle progression and proliferation by increasing 
glycolysis activity and thus may serve as an oncogene for breast cancer."
1123,"Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor types and the leading 
cause of cancer‑associated death worldwide. Different types of lung cancer 
exhibit differences in terms of pathophysiology and pathogenesis, and also 
treatment and prognosis. Accumulating evidence has indicated that circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) are abnormally expressed among different types of lung cancer and 
confer important biological functions in progression and prognosis. However, 
studies comparing different circRNAs in lung cancer subtypes are scarce. 
Furthermore, circRNAs have an important role in drug resistance and are related 
to clinicopathological features in lung cancer. Summaries of the association of 
circRNAs with drug resistance are also scarce in the literature. The present 
study outlined the biological functions of circRNAs and focused on 
discriminating differential circRNA patterns and mechanisms in three different 
types of lung cancer. The emerging roles of circRNAs in the resistance to 
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy were also 
highlighted. Understanding these aspects of circRNAs sheds light on novel 
physiological and pathophysiological processes of lung cancer and suggests the 
application of circRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as 
therapeutic resistance."
1124,"As a population, living kidney donors have a longer life expectancy than the 
general population. This is generally thought to be an artifact of selection, as 
only healthy individuals are allowed to donate, and the operative mortality and 
risk of subsequent renal failure are very low. However, there may also be an 
additional benefit to the process, as the donor evaluation may uncover an early 
occult cancer or a potentially serious medical problem. While these problems may 
preclude donation, they may be lifesaving, as they are likely to be diagnosed 
and treated before the donor develops symptoms. We looked at the incidence of 
occult cancer and other previously undiagnosed medical problems including renal 
disease, diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, and hepatitis C, in 
individuals volunteering to become a kidney donor at our center who proceeded 
with the evaluation between 01/01/1996 and 05/31/2011. Of 4088 potential donors, 
19 (0.46%) were discovered to have an unsuspected cancer, and 286 (7%) were 
found to have a previously undiagnosed medical problem. The living donor 
evaluation may lead to the early diagnosis of a life threatening illness. This 
should be considered as one of the potential benefits of living donation. This

1125,"Cytotoxic immune cells, including T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) 
cells, are essential components of the host response against tumors. CTLs and NK 
cells secrete granzyme A (GzmA) upon recognition of cancer cells; however, there 
are very few tools that can detect physiological levels of active GzmA with high 
spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, we report the rational design of the 
near-infrared fluorogenic substrates for human GzmA and mouse GzmA. These 
activity-based probes display very high catalytic efficiency and selectivity 
over other granzymes, as shown in tissue lysates from wild-type and GzmA 
knock-out mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the probes can image how 
adaptive immune cells respond to antigen-driven recognition of cancer cells in 
real time."
1126,"Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death for women in low-resource 
settings. The World Health Organization recommends that cervical cancer 
screening programs incorporate HPV DNA testing, but available tests are 
expensive, require laboratory infrastructure, and cannot be performed at the 
point-of-care. We developed a two-dimensional paper network (2DPN), 
hybrid-capture, signal amplification assay and a point-of-care sample 
preparation protocol to detect high-risk HPV DNA from exfoliated cervical cells 
within an hour. The test does not require expensive equipment and has an 
estimated cost of <$3 per test without the need for batching. We evaluated 
performance of the paper HPV DNA assay with short synthetic and genomic HPV DNA 
targets, HPV positive and negative cellular samples, and two sets of clinical 
samples. The first set of clinical samples consisted of 16 biobanked, 
provider-collected cervical samples from a study in El Salvador previously 
tested with careHPV and subsequently tested in a controlled laboratory 
environment. The paper HPV DNA test correctly identified eight of eight 
HPV-negative clinical samples and seven of eight HPV-positive clinical samples. 
We then performed a field evaluation of the paper HPV DNA test in a hospital 
laboratory in Mozambique. Cellular controls generated expected results 
throughout field testing with fully lyophilized sample preparation and 2DPN 
reagents. When evaluated with 16 residual self-collected cervicovaginal samples 
previously tested by the GeneXpert HPV assay (""Xpert""), the accuracy of the HPV 
DNA paper test in the field was reduced compared to testing in the controlled 
laboratory environment, with positive results obtained for all eight 
HPV-positive samples as well as seven of eight HPV-negative samples. Further 
evaluation showed reduction in performance was likely due in part to increased 
concentration of exfoliated cells in the self-collected clinical samples from 
Mozambique compared with provider-collected samples from El Salvador. Finally, a 
formal usability assessment was conducted with users in El Salvador and 
Mozambique; the assay was rated as acceptable to perform after minimal training. 
With additional optimization for higher cell concentrations and inclusion of an 
internal cellular control, the paper HPV DNA assay offers promise as a low-cost, 
point-of-care cervical cancer screening test in low-resource settings."
1127,"BACKGROUND: The study aims to clarify the association of sarcopenia with 
perioperative and postoperative complications in oral cavity squamous cell 
carcinoma (OCSCC) patients undergoing curative surgery and to understand the 
reasons causing the poor oncologic outcomes for OCSCC.
METHODS: We conducted a propensity score matching study to investigate the 
association of perioperative and postoperative outcomes in OCSCC patients with 
sarcopenia and without sarcopenia. A retrospective analysis of a large national 
data set from the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database was conducted. At least two 
claims for patients with a principal diagnosis of sarcopenia within the 12-month 
preoperative period were defined as the criteria for sarcopenia diagnosis 
(ICD-10-CM code M62.84). Sarcopenia was diagnosed through the measurement of low 
muscle strength and low muscle mass by any one of the patient's attending 
orthopaedic physician, rehabilitation physician, family medicine specialist or 
geriatrician. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to calculate the 
perioperative, and postoperative major complications.
RESULTS: Our final cohort included 16 293 patients with OCSCC (10 862 and 5 431 
in the sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups, respectively) who were eligible for 
further analysis. The sarcopenia group was 10.40% female and 89.60% male, and 
the nonsarcopenia group was 9.74% female and 90.26% male. The mean 
age ± standard deviation (SD) were 56.44 ± 11.14 and 56.22 ± 11.29 for 
sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups. OCSCC patients with sarcopenia undergoing 
curative surgery had a significantly higher blood transfusion rate and volume; 
longer intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospital stay; higher postoperative 
30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
[1.07, 1.56]) and rates of pneumonia (aOR: 1.34, 95% CI [1.20, 1.50]), acute 
renal failure (aOR: 1.45, 95% CI [1.12, 1.87]) and septicaemia (aOR: 1.29, 95% 
CI [1.15, 1.45]); higher postoperative first-year mortality (aOR: 1.18, 95% CI 
[1.13, 1.51]) and rates of pneumonia (aOR: 1.43, 95% CI [1.30, 1.56]), acute 
myocardial infarction (aOR: 1.52, 95% CI [1.06, 2.18]) and septicaemia (aOR: 
1.29, 95% CI [1.15, 1.45]).
CONCLUSIONS: OCSCC patients with sarcopenia might exhibit more perioperative and 
surgical complications than those without sarcopenia."
1128,"Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC) account for <5% of pancreatic 
malignancies. The efficacy of modern chemotherapy regimens in patients with 
advanced PASC is unknown. Patients with advanced PASC from 2008 to 2021 were 
consecutively included in this retrospective multicenter study. Overall survival 
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method. 
Ninety-four PASC from 16 French centers were included (median age, 67.3 years; 
males, 56.4%; metastatic disease, 85.1%). The first-line treatment was 
chemotherapy for 79 patients (84.0%) (37 FOLFIRINOX (FX), 7 Gemcitabine-nab 
paclitaxel (GN), and 35 for all other regimen) or best supportive care (BSC) 
alone for 15 patients (16.0%). No significant difference was observed between FX 
and GN in terms of PFS (p=0.67) or OS (p=0.5). Modern regimens pooled together 
(FX and GN) as compared to all others chemotherapy regimens showed an 
improvement of overall response rate (39.5% and 9.7%, p=0.002), PFS (median, 7.8 
versus 4.7 months, p=0.02) and OS (median, 12.7 vs 9.2 months, p=0.35). This 
large study evaluating first-line treatment regimens in advanced PASC suggests 
that modern regimens as FX or GN may be preferable to all other chemotherapy 
regimens. These results deserve confirmation in prospective studies."
1129,"This study aimed to estimate the epidemiological trends of gastric cancer in the 
United States from 1992 to 2019. This population-based study used the US 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-12 database as a fundamental cohort 
to analyze gastric cancer incidence, incidence-based mortality (IBM), overall 
survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) probabilities from 1992 to 
2019. The Global Burden of Disease study (1990-2018) was used as a likely 
validation cohort. Age-period-cohort analyses were performed to explore the 
underlying causes of trend changes. We found that the incidence rate of gastric 
cancer decreased from 1992 to 2019. IBM also decreased significantly from 1997 
to 2019. The 3-year OS and CSS of gastric cancer increased from 22.3% to 28.7% 
and 25.7% to 33.5%, respectively. However, the proportion of distant gastric 
cancer cases had unexpectedly increased rapidly from 33.1% in 1992 to 44.7% in 
2019. Age-period-cohort modeling found that the incidence and IBM rates remained 
stable in the groups aged below 50 years, while that in all age groups older 
than 50 years showed a significant downward trend. High incidence and mortality 
risks were observed in the younger birth cohorts (birth year after 1990). To 
conclude, we observed a decline in incidence and mortality rates of gastric 
cancer in the United States in the past decades. We determined that progression 
of primary and tertiary preventive measures is the main reason for the reduction 
in the disease burden of gastric cancer. However, secondary preventive measures 
for gastric cancer still need to be strengthened."
1130,"Infecting the stomach of almost 50% of people, Helicobacter pylori is a 
causative agent of gastritis, peptic ulcers and stomach cancers. Interactions 
between bacterial membrane-bound lectin, Blood group Antigen Binding Adhesin 
(BabA), and human blood group antigens are key in the initiation of infection. 
Herein, we report the synthesis of a B-antigen hexasaccharide (B6) and a B-Lewis 
b heptasaccharide (BLeb7) and Bovine Serum Albumin glycoconjugates thereof to 
assess the binding properties and preferences of BabA from different strains. 
From a previously reported trisaccharide acceptor a versatile key 
Lacto-N-tetraose tetrasaccharide intermediate was synthesized, which allowed us 
to explore various routes to the final targets, either via initial introduction 
of fucosyl residues followed by introduction of the B-determinant or vice versa. 
The first approach proved unsuccessful, whereas the second afforded the target 
structures in good yields. Protein conjugation using isothiocyanate methodology 
allowed us to reach high glycan loadings (up to 23 per protein) to mimic 
multivalent displays encountered in Nature. Protein glycoconjugate inhibition 
binding studies were performed with H. pylori strains displaying high or low 
affinity for Lewis b hexasaccharide structures showing that the binding to the 
high affinity strain was reduced due to the presence of the B-determinant in the 
Bleb7-conjugates and further reduced by the absence of the Lewis fucose residue 
in the B6-conjugate."
1131,"Cancer is one of the main diseases threatening human life, accounting for 
millions of deaths around the world each year. Traditional physical and chemical 
methods for cancer treatment are extremely time-consuming, lab-intensive, 
expensive, inefficient and difficult to be applied in a high-throughput way. 
Hence, it is an urgent task to develop automated computational methods to enable 
fast and accurate identification of anticancer peptides (ACPs). In this paper, 
we develop a novel model named iACP-GE to identify ACPs. Multi-features are 
extracted by using binary encoding, enhanced grouped amino acid composition and 
BLOSUM62 encoding based on the N5C5 sequence, as well as detrended forward 
moving-average auto-cross correlation analysis based on physicochemical 
properties of 20 natural amino acids. Thus, 835 features are obtained for each 
sample, in order to avoid information redundancy, gradient boosting decision 
tree was adopted as the feature selection strategy. Then, the optimal feature 
subset is input to the extra tree classifier. The accuracies of ACP740 and 
ACP240 datasets with the 5-fold cross-validation were 90.54% and 91.25%, 
respectively. Experimental results indicate that iACP-GE significantly 
outperforms several existing models on ACP740 and ACP240 datasets and can be 
used as an effective tool for the identification of ACPs. The datasets and 
source codes for iACP-GE are available at

1132,"BACKGROUND: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the deadliest form of lung cancer 
but lacks targeted therapies.
METHODS: We studied the effect of the natural product mistletoe lectin (ML) in 
pre-clinical models of SCLC, focusing on cell lines with amplification of the 
myc family oncogenes C-myc and N-myc.
RESULTS: We found that ML treatment inhibits growth of SCLC cell lines in 
culture and induces apoptosis. ML treatment also decreases the expression of the 
amplified myc proteins. Over-expression of either C-myc or N-myc results in 
enhanced SCLC cell sensitivity to ML. In a mouse xenograft model of SCLC, 
treatment with ML results in decreased tumor growth over 4 weeks with evidence 
of increased apoptosis in tumors from treated animals.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our results demonstrate that ML exhibits therapeutic 
potential in SCLC, that is at least partially dependent on myc protein 
expression."

lymphoid leukaemia was seen in two cases. This small-scale review demonstrates 
that lymphoid neoplasia should be considered as a differential diagnosis in 
elasmobranchs presenting with lethargy and anorexia and highlights the 
challenges of immunohistochemical work up."
1134,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the thematic features of dignity therapy generativity 
documents of advanced cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in mainland China 
from the perspective of meaning-making during dignity therapy.
METHODS: This is a qualitative descriptive study. Content analysis was used to 
analyze 24 dignity therapy generativity documents derived from a 
quasi-experimental trial of dignity therapy for advanced cancer patients 
receiving chemotherapy in a daycare center at a cancer hospital in northern 
China.
RESULTS: Among the 24 advanced cancer patients whose generativity documents were 
analyzed, 14 were male and ranged in age from 26 to 78 years (average = 50.3). 
Two dimensions emerged from the data: (1) the sources of meaning in life, which 
consisted of social relationships, things and circumstances providing meaning in 
life, and (2) the ultimate meaning in life, referring to finding one's real self 
and realizing the purpose in life, including personal life goals, dignity and 
autonomy, and morality of patients.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The multidimensional constructs of meaning in life with 
distinctive traditional Chinese cultural characteristics could provide insights 
into dignity-conserving care for advanced cancer patients with Chinese culture 
and provide evidence for refining the implementation protocol of DT through 
intentionally addressing the ultimate meaning of patients in the therapeutic 
session."

SUMMARY: Considering these factors will allow us to more effectively translate 
novel targeted therapies to benefit pediatric patients."
1136,"OBJECTIVES: The immune dysregulation during SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to 
worsen immune homeostasis after recovery. Patients with hematological 
malignancies with COVID-19 have changes both in the innate and adaptive immune 
responses. Little is known about the severity of immune dysfunction following 
recovery from COVID-19 in hematological patients.
METHODS: Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the lymphocyte subsets 
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by FACS Canto II in 55 patients, 
including 42 with hematological malignancies 4-6 weeks after COVID-19.
RESULTS: Hematological COVID-19 convalescents had deep reduction in CD3+ T 
cells, including helper T cells (CD3+CD4+), naïve helper T cells 
(CD3+CD4+CD45RA+) and memory CD4+ T cells among with extremely low levels of 
Treg cells and decreased expression of both TCRα/β and TCRγ/δ. Severe immune 
dysregulation in hematological convalescents was expressed by increased 
activation of T lymphocytes, both as elevated levels of activated T cells 
(CD3+HLA-DR+) and activated cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+HLA-DR+).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed a profound impairment of the adaptive immune 
response in hematological convalescents which might be a result of persistent 
activation of T cells. Convalescents with lymphoid malignancies showed more 
pronounced depletion of key T lymphocytes subpopulations in creating an 
effective adaptive response and immune memory. This article is protected by

1138,"Surgery is currently the only cure for rectal prolapse. Standardized 
preoperative evaluation and appropriate selection of surgical methods are 
crucial to the outcome of rectal prolapse surgery. With the development of a 
series of clinical studies in China and abroad, transabdominal surgery (such as 
ventral mesh fixation) and transperineal (anal) surgery (such as Altemeier 
surgery) have been widely recognized. Precise preoperative assessment of rectal 
prolapse and appropriate selection of surgical approaches has important clinical 
value in reducing postoperative recurrence rates and surgical-related 
complications. However, the current rectal prolapse assessment system needs to 
be improved, and the choice of surgical procedures remains controversal. To 
guide the diagnosis and surgical treatment of patients with rectal prolapse in 
China, nationwide specialists of colorectal and pelvic floor surgery have been

1139,"Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a main active component of propolis and a 
flavonoid, is one of the natural products that has attracted attention in recent 
years. CAPE, which has many properties such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-fungal, has shown many pharmacological 
potentials, including protective effects on multiple organs. Interestingly, 
molecular docking studies showed the possibility of binding of CAPE with 
replication enzyme. In addition, it was seen that in order to increase the 
binding security of the replication enzyme and CAPE, modifications can be made 
at three sites on the CAPE molecule, which leads to the possibility of the 
compound working more powerfully and usefully to prevent the proliferation of 
cancer cells and reduce its rate. Also, it was found that CAPE has an inhibitory 
effect against the main protease enzyme and may be effective in the treatment of 
SARS-CoV-2. This review covers in detail the importance of CAPE in alternative 
medicine, its pharmacological value, its potential as a cancer 
anti-proliferative agent, its dual role in radioprotection and

1140,"INTRODUCTION: Fluorescence-guided surgery has emerged as a complement of 
traditional laparoscopic surgery with the advantage that is adaptable to 
existent platforms. The purpose of this article is to describe our technique for 
ureteral identification with indocyanine green (ICG) during laparoscopic 
colorectal surgery.
MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: We report a case series of all patients who 
underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery and ureteral injection of ICG in a 
private third level hospital.
RESULTS: We performed 30 laparoscopic colorectal surgeries in which we used this 
technique to identify the ureters. Mean age was 52.6 ± 15.28 years; 16 (53.3%) 
were men. The indication for surgery was diverticulitis in 18 patients. Mean 
urological operative time was 22.4 minutes. There were no immediate or delayed 
adverse effects attributable to intra-ureteral ICG administration.
DISCUSSION: Although ureteric iatrogenic injury is uncommon, when it does 
happen, it significantly increases the patient's morbidity. We consider this 
technique has the potential to make laparoscopic surgeries safer mostly in 
patients with cancer, diverticular disease or endometriosis who have extensive 
fibrosis, adhesions, and inflammation."
1141,"OBJECTIVE: The incidence of women entering into pregnancy with BMI indicating 
overweight or obesity is rising with concurrent increases in adverse 
complications such as gestational diabetes. Although several studies have 
examined the compositional changes to the microbiome across BMI classifications, 
there has been no investigation regarding changes in microbial function during 
pregnancy.
METHODS: A total of 105 gastrointestinal microbiome biospecimens were used in 
this analysis. Biospecimens were sequenced by using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 
shotgun metagenomics platform.
RESULTS: Findings indicate an enrichment in microbiota from the phylum 
Firmicutes across all pregravid BMI groups with a decrease in α diversity in 
groups with BMI indicating obesity or overweight compared with a group with BMI 
indicating normal weight (p = 0.02). More specifically, women with BMI 
indicating obesity or overweight had enrichment in Bifidobacterium bifidum and 
B. adolescentis. Women with BMI > 25 kg/m2 had a higher abundance of microbiota 
that support biotin synthesis and regulate epithelial cells in the lower 
gastrointestinal tract. These epithelial cells are responsible for host 
adaptability to dietary lipid variation and caloric absorption.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that there are differences in microbial 
composition and function between BMI groups. Future research should consider how 
these changes contribute to specific clinical outcomes during pregnancy."
1142,"Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a transcription-associated protein involved 
in controlling the cell cycle and is often deregulated in stress conditions. 
CDK9 is being studied as a well-known druggable target for developing effective 
therapeutics against a wide range of cancer, cardiac dysfunction and 
inflammatory diseases. Owing to the significance of CDK9 in the etiology of 
hematological and solid malignancies, its structure, biological activity, 
regulation and its pharmacological inhibition are being explored for therapeutic 
management of cancer. We employed a structure-based virtual high-throughput 
screening of bioactive compounds from the IMPPAT database to discover potential 
bioactive inhibitors of CDK9. The preliminary results were obtained from the 
Lipinski criteria, ADMET parameters and sorting compounds without any PAINS 
patterns. Subsequently, binding affinity and selectivity analyses were used to 
find effective CDK9 hits. This screening resulted in the identification of two 
natural compounds, Glabrene and Guggulsterone with high affinity and specificity 
for the CDK9 binding site. Both compounds exhibit drug-like characteristics, as 
projected by ADMET analysis, physicochemical data and PASS evaluation. Both 
compounds preferentially bind to the ATP-binding pocket of CDK9 and interact 
with functionally important residues. Further, the dynamics and consistency of 
CDK9 interaction with Glabrene and Guggulsteron were evaluated through all-atom 
molecular dynamic (MD) simulations which suggested the stability of both 
complexes. The results might be deployed to introduce novel CDK9 inhibitors that 
may treat life-threatening diseases, including cancer.Communicated by Ramaswamy

1144,"Lung and breast cancers are among the most common cancers. In the present work, 
initially, 6-bromo-; and 6-chloro-3-hydroxychromone compounds were prepared. In 
the next step, a series of 8-bromo-; and 8-chloro-dihyropyrano[3,2-b]chromene 
derivatives were synthesized by one-pot three component reaction of these two 
compounds, aromatic aldehydes, and ethyl cyanoacetate in the presence of 
triethylamine in EtOH at reflux conditions. The synthesized compounds were 
tested for their in vitro cytotoxic activity against A549 (lung cancer) and 
MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines. It was found that some compounds have high to 
moderate cytotoxicity, which makes them potential candidates for further 
studies. This study can be the basis for further studies to design and synthesis 
potent anticancer compounds and investigating their mechanism of action."
1145,"In this study, a series of hydrazide-hydrazone derivatives (3a-3u) were 
synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer activities against prostate

particular, compound 3h having a pyrrole ring was found to be the most potent 
derivative with IC50 = 1.32, 2.99, 1.71 µM against PC-3, MCF-7, HT-29 cancer 
cell lines respectively using paclitaxel as a standard compound. Furthermore, 
compound 3h was subjected to further biological studies such as caspase-3 
activity and Annexin-V assay to evaluate their inhibitory potentials. The 
activity results displayed that compound 3h increased caspase-3 activation and 
the number of cells to early apoptosis. The additional studies like 
pharmacokinetics, bioavailability scores and drug-likeness properties were also 
evaluated. The in silico pharmacokinetics predictions displayed that the

1146,"Key homeostasis providing cells in the central nervous system (CNS) are 
astrocytes, which belong to the class of cells known as atroglia, a highly 
heterogeneous type of neuroglia and a prominent element of the brain defence. 
Diseases evolve due to altered homeostatic state, associated with 
pathology-induced astroglia remodelling represented by reactive astrocytes, 
astroglial atrophy and astrodegeneration. These features are hallmarks of most 
infectious insults, mediated by bacteria, protozoa and viruses; they are also 
prominent in the systemic infection. The COVID-19 pandemic revived the focus 
into neurotropic viruses such as SARS-CoV2 (Coronaviridae) but also the 
Flaviviridae viruses including tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) and Zika virus 
(ZIKV) causing the epidemic in South America prior to COVID-19. Astrocytes 
provide a key response to neurotropic infections in the CNS. Astrocytes form a 
parenchymal part of the blood-brain barrier, the site of virus entry into the 
CNS. Astrocytes exhibit aerobic glycolysis, a form of metabolism characteristic 
of highly morphologically plastic cells, like cancer cells, hence a suitable 
milieu for multiplication of infectious agent, including viral particles. 
However, why the protection afforded by astrocytes fails in some circumstances 
is an open question to be studied in the future."
1147,"Anxiety is among the most prevalent psychiatric conditions, yet little attention 
has been paid to whether putative cognitive vulnerability factors related to 
anxiety in predominantly White samples are related to anxiety among Black 
individuals. Yet, given less mental health service utilization and greater 
experience of some life stressors, Black persons may be especially at risk for 
using false safety behaviors (FSB; designed to decrease anxiety in the short 
term, but are associated with more longer-term mental health problems). We 
tested whether non-Hispanic/Latin Black persons (n = 133) reported greater FSB 
use than non-Hispanic/Latin White participants (n = 844) as well as whether FSB 
use was related to more mental health problems among Black participants. Data 
were collected online among undergraduates. Black participants did endorse more 
frequent FSB use, especially FSB-Avoidance and FSB-Body Sensations. Results 
indicate that among Black participants, FSB use was related to more anxiety, 
depression, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. FSB may be an important 
behavioral vulnerability factor related to anxiety and associated mental health 
problems among Black young adults."
1148,"Primary pancreatic paragangliomas are rare. They are mainly non-functional 
tumours that lack typical clinical manifestations. Definite diagnosis relies on 
histopathology and immunohistochemistry, and the main treatment is surgery. We 
report here a case of primary, non-functional, pancreatic paraganglioma in a 
49-year-old woman. The tumour was approximately 5.0 × 3.2 ×4.7 cm in size and 
located in the pancreatic neck and body. We undertook 3D laparoscopic complete 
resection of the tumour. The patient developed a pancreatic fistula (biochemical

related reports."
1149,"INTRODUCTION: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PNETs) are heterogenous 
entities with variable clinical outlook. The prevalence of PNETs is increasing 
in Australia. Despite this, data on peri-operative management and post-operative 
prognosis for Australian patients is scant in the literature.
METHODS: Patients from two tertiary hospitals in Victoria were recruited. 
Inclusion criteria included patients who underwent curative surgical resection 
for primary, non-functioning, PNETs without metastases from January 2011 to 
December 2021. Patients were identified via histopathological reports, CMBS and 
ICD-10 codes. Data were sourced from Electronic Medical Records, outpatient 
notes and letters.
RESULTS: Sixty-three patients (34 Male, 29 Female) underwent surgical resection 
for PNETs. Fifty-three patients (84.1%) had a post-operative complication, and 
21 (33.3%) had severe complications. Two patients had disease recurrence. Head 
PNETs had higher Ki-67% (5.33 vs. 2.72, P = 0.29), and likelihood of nodal 
spread (9 (36%) vs. 4 (16%), P = 0.054). Pancreatic Head resections were also 
associated with more frequent ICU admissions (21 (84%) vs. 18 (54.5), 
P = 0.024), longer ICU stays (4.05 vs. 2.17 days, P = 0.10) and hospital stays 
(26.76 vs. 8.27 days, P = <0.001).
CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, it demonstrates that surgical 
resection of PNET carries a significant morbidity with a low rate of recurrence. 
Additionally, Pancreatic head NETs may be associated with higher grades and 
increased likelihood of nodal metastases. Considering this, careful patient 
selection is paramount."
1150,"BACKGROUND: In this study we explored whether one pleural catheter plus single 
chest tube drainage could achieve a noninferior drainage effect when compared 
with the traditional two chest tubes in uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic 
surgery (VATS) for an upper pulmonary lobectomy.
METHODS: Patients that underwent an upper pulmonary lobectomy from January to 
November 2020 were enrolled in this single-center, randomized, open-label, 
noninferiority trial. Prior to closure, patients were randomized to an 
intervention group who received an improved drainage strategy involving one 
pleural catheter with one chest tube (24 Fr), while traditional double chest 
tube drainage was applied for the control group.
RESULTS: A total of 390 patients entered the study, although 190 were excluded 
for changing nonuniportal surgical approaches or opting for nonlobectomy 
resections. Finally, 200 patients were randomized (100 in the intervention group 
and 100 in the control group). The baseline demographic and clinical 
characteristics were comparable between the groups. The incidence of 
pneumothorax in the intervention and control groups was similar on postoperative 
Day 1 (noninferiority, 10% vs. 13%, p = 0.658). In addition, there were no 
significant differences in secondary outcomes such as incidence of pneumothorax 
by Day 30, postoperative chest tube/pleural catheter removal time, amount of 
drainage on Day 1, total amount of drainage after operation, or postoperative 
hospitalization. A significantly lower pain score was observed in the 
intervention group (3.33 ± 0.68 vs. 3.68 ± 0.94, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: The new strategy is noninferior to double chest tube drainage after 
an upper pulmonary lobectomy offers superior pain control, and is recommended 
for an upper lobectomy by uniportal VATS."
1151,"BACKGROUND: Humans with inactivating mutations in growth hormone receptor (GHR) 
have lower rates of cancer, including prostate cancer. Similarly, mice with 
inactivating Ghr mutations are protected from prostatic intraepithelial 
neoplasia in the C3(1)/TAg prostate cancer model. However, gaps in clinical 
relevance in those models persist. The current study addresses these gaps and 
the ongoing role of Ghr in prostate cancer using loss-of-function and 
gain-of-function models.
METHODS: Conditional Ghr inactivation was achieved in the C3(1)/TAg model by 
employing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre and a prostate-specific Cre. In parallel, a 
transgenic GH antagonist was also used. Pathology, proliferation, and gene 
expression of 6-month old mouse prostates were assessed. Analysis of The Cancer 
Genome Atlas data was conducted to identify GHR overexpression in a subset of 
human prostate cancers. Ghr overexpression was modeled in PTEN-P2 and TRAMP-C2 
mouse prostate cancer cells using stable transfectants. The growth, 
proliferation, and gene expression effects of Ghr overexpression was assessed in 
vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: Loss-of-function for Ghr globally or in prostatic epithelial cells 
reduced proliferation and stratification of the prostatic epithelium in the 
C3(1)/TAg model. Genes and gene sets involved in the immune system and 
tumorigenesis, for example, were dysregulated upon global Ghr disruption. 
Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed higher GHR expression in human 
prostate cancers with ERG-fusion genes or ETV1-fusion genes. Modeling the GHR 
overexpression observed in these human prostate cancers by overexpressing Ghr in 
mouse prostate cancer cells with mutant Pten or T-antigen driver genes increased 
proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Ghr overexpression 
regulated the expression of multiple genes oppositely to Ghr loss-of-function 
models.
CONCLUSIONS: Loss-of-function and gain-of-function Ghr models, including 
prostatic epithelial cell specific alterations in Ghr, altered proliferation, 
and gene expression. These data suggest that changes in GHR activity in human 
prostatic epithelial cells play a role in proliferation and gene regulation in 
prostate cancer, suggesting the potential for disrupting GH signaling, for 
example by the FDA approved GH antagonist pegvisomant, may be beneficial in 
treating prostate cancer."
1152,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Opioids are commonly used for the management of 
cancer-associated pain and chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. The chemotherapeutic 
agent CPT-11 causes severe GI toxicity as a result of deconjugation of its 
inactive metabolite SN-38G by intestinal bacterial β-glucuronidases to the 
pharmacologically active SN-38. As opioids are known to cause gut microbial 
dysbiosis, this study evaluated whether CPT-11's anti-tumor efficacy and GI 
toxicity are exacerbated by opioid co-administration.
EXPERIMENT APPROACH: 8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were treated with CPT-11 ± 
opioid co-administration. 16S rRNA sequencing was used for gut microbiome 
analysis. LC-MS analyses of plasma and intestinal extracts were performed to 
investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of CPT-11. Histological analysis and 
qRT-PCR were used to determine the severity of intestinal tissue damage. The in 
vitro assay using human liver microsome was also performed to confirm the 
effects of opioids on CPT-11 metabolism.
KEY RESULTS: Gut microbiome analysis showed that morphine treatment induced 
enrichment of β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestines of 
CPT-11-treated mice, resulting in SN-38 accumulation and exacerbation of GI 
toxicity in the small intestine. Oral administration of both antibiotics and a 
glucuronidase inhibitor protected mice against GI toxicity induced with CPT-11 
and morphine co-administration, implicating a microbiome-dependent mechanism. 
Additionally, morphine and loperamide decreased the plasma concentration of 
SN-38 and compromised CPT-11's anti-tumor efficacy, although this seemed to be 
microbiome-independent.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Gut microbiota play a significant role in opioid 
and chemotherapeutic agent drug-drug interactions. Inhibition of gut microbial 
glucuronidase may also prevent adverse GI effects of CPT-11 in patients on 
opioids."
1153,"Glucose oxidase (GOD) has a wide range of applications in biosensing and cancer 
treatment as a result of its unique biocatalytic properties. More importantly, 
GOD could synergistically enhance the cancer therapeutic effect when combined 
with other cancer therapeutic strategies. However, the interaction of GOD with a 
cancer therapeutic agent has not been well-studied. Herein, the thermodynamic 
properties of the interaction between black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) and 
GOD were systematically elucidated, and the dose-dependent conformational and 
enzymatic activity changes of BPQDs on GOD were quantitatively and qualitatively 
analyzed. The results indicated that the stoichiometric ratio of BPQDs to GOD 
was approximately 1:1. In particular, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular 
dichroism spectra, and Fourier transform infrared spectra have synergistically 
studied the changes in secondary and tertiary conformations of GOD induced by 
BPQDs. Higher doses of BPQDs resulted in a loose structure of GOD but still 
maintained the native conformation and preserved effective enzymatic activity, 
effectively catalyzing the production of H2O2 from glucose in a cell. The 
interaction mechanism between BPQDs and GOD provides a theoretical basis for the 
design of GOD-based multimodal synergistic cancer therapy and its clinical 
translation analysis."
1154,"BACKGROUND: There is a knowledge gap regarding lobar versus sublobar resection 
for atypical carcinoid (AC) of the lung. As such, the authors sought to 
understand and analyze the outcomes of sublobar resection versus lobectomy in 
this patient population.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis using the National Cancer Database was 
performed to compare overall survival (OS) between patients treated with 
lobectomy and patients treated with sublobar resection for AC of the lung 
between the years 2004 and 2016. Patient characteristics were compared with χ2 
tests. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS distributions, and the 
log-rank test was used to compare distributions by treatment strategy. A 
multivariable Cox regression model was used to assess associations between the 
treatment strategy and OS. A propensity score matching method was also 
implemented to further eliminate treatment selection bias in the study sample.
RESULTS: The database identified 669 patients with T1-T4 and N0-N3 lung ACs that 
were surgically resected. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves did not 
demonstrate an OS difference between lobectomy and sublobar resection 
(p = .094). After propensity score matching, curves demonstrated a numerical 
improvement in OS with lobectomy; however, it was not statistically significant 
(p = .5). In a subgroup analysis, lobectomy and node-negative disease were 
associated with the best OS, whereas sublobar resection and node-positive 
disease were associated with the worst OS (p < .0001). Nodal involvement was 
associated with worse survival, regardless of surgical treatment (p < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T1-T4 and N0-N3 ACs of the lung, lobectomy was not 
associated with an improvement in OS in comparison with sublobar resection."
1155,"OBJECTIVES: The current study explored the impact of cancer-related fertility 
concerns on existential distress and meaning making among female breast cancer 
(BC) patients of childbearing age and assessed support needs.
METHODS: The current study was embedded within a larger study. A seven-question 
online survey was administered to female BC participants to explore meaning and 
identity in their lives. Applied thematic analysis was used to analyze 
participants' written responses.
RESULTS: A total of 98 participants completed the survey, the majority of whom 
identified as white, married or partnered, and employed full time and with stage 
I or II BC. More than 50% of the participants expressed a need for support from 
a counselor or support group during their cancer experience. Three subthemes 
emerged related to existential distress and cancer-related fertility concerns: 
(1) loss of womanhood: treatment-related physical changes impact on gender 
identity; (2) existential distress due to treatment decisions impacting 
fertility; and (3) shattered vision: cancer-related infertility impact on 
meaning and purpose. Four subthemes emerged related to meaning making with 
fertility-related existential concerns: (1) coping with loss of meaning, (2) 
re-evaluating priorities in life; (3) resilience to loss, and (4) persistent 
loss of meaning.
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Study results offer valuable insights into the 
experiences of female BC survivors' cancer-related fertility on existential 
distress and meaning making. Development of psychological interventions targeted 
to support this population to cope with existential distress due to 
cancer-related fertility concerns and meaning making are needed to improve the 
quality of life of this population."
1156,"Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is treated as a homogeneous disease, although the 
expression of NEUROD1, ASCL1, POU2F3, and YAP1 identifies distinct molecular 
subtypes. The MYC oncogene, amplified in SCLC, was recently shown to act as a 
lineage-specific factor to associate subtypes with histological classes. Indeed, 
MYC-driven SCLCs show a distinct metabolic profile and drug sensitivity. To 
disentangle their molecular features, we focused on the co-amplified PVT1, 
frequently overexpressed and originating circular (circRNA) and chimeric RNAs. 
We analyzed hsa_circ_0001821 (circPVT1) and PVT1/AKT3 (chimPVT1) as examples of 
such transcripts, respectively, to unveil their tumorigenic contribution to 
SCLC. In detail, circPVT1 activated a pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic 
program when over-expressed in lung cells, and knockdown of chimPVT1 induced a 
decrease in cell growth and an increase of apoptosis in SCLC in vitro. Moreover, 
the investigated PVT1 transcripts underlined a functional connection between MYC 
and YAP1/POU2F3, suggesting that they contribute to the transcriptional 
landscape associated with MYC amplification. In conclusion, we have uncovered a 
functional role of circular and chimeric PVT1 transcripts in SCLC; these 
entities may prove useful as novel biomarkers in MYC-amplified tumors. This

1157,"Immunotherapy has led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of cancer. Current 
cancer immunotherapies are mostly antibody-based, thus possessing advantages in 
regard to pharmacodynamics (e.g., specificity and efficacy). However, they have 
limitations in terms of pharmacokinetics including long half-lives, poor 
tissue/tumor penetration, and little/no oral bioavailability. In addition, 
therapeutic antibodies are immunogenic, thus may cause unwanted adverse effects. 
Therefore, researchers have shifted their efforts towards the development of 
small molecule-based cancer immunotherapy, as small molecules may overcome the 
above disadvantages associated with antibodies. Further, small molecule-based 
immunomodulators and therapeutic antibodies are complementary modalities for 
cancer treatment, and may be combined to elicit synergistic effects. Recent 
years have witnessed the rapid development of small molecule-based cancer 
immunotherapy. In this review, we describe the current progress in small 
molecule-based immunomodulators (inhibitors/agonists/degraders) for cancer 
therapy, including those targeting PD-1/PD-L1, chemokine receptors, stimulator 
of interferon genes (STING), Toll-like receptor (TLR), etc. The tumorigenesis 
mechanism of various targets and their respective modulators that have entered 
clinical trials are also summarized."
1158,"Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, as it can 
make the treatment of bacterial infections in humans difficult owing to their 
high incidence rate, mortality, and treatment costs. Bacteriophage, which 
constitutes a type of virus that can kill bacteria, is a promising alternative 
strategy against antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. Although 
bacteriophage therapy was first used nearly a century ago, its development came 
to a standstill after introducing the antibiotics. Nowadays, with the rise in 
antibiotic resistance, bacteriophage therapy is in the spotlight again. As 
bacteriophage therapy is safe and has significant anti-bacterial activity, some 
specific types of bacteriophages (such as bacteriophage phiX174 and Pyo 
bacteriophage complex liquid) entered into phase III clinical trials. Herein, we 
review the key points of the antibiotic resistance crisis and illustrate the 
factors that support the renewal of bacteriophage applications. By summarizing 
recent state-of-the-art studies and clinical data on bacteriophage treatment, we 
introduced (i) the pharmacological mechanisms and advantages of antibacterial 
bacteriophages, (ii) bacteriophage preparations with clinical potential and 
bacteriophage-derived anti-bacterial treatment strategies, and (iii) 
bacteriophage therapeutics aimed at multiple infection types and 
infection-induced cancer treatments. Finally, we highlighted the challenges and 
critical perspectives of bacteriophage therapy for future clinical development."
1159,"Cancer immunotherapy has significantly flourished and revolutionized the limited 
conventional tumor therapies, on account of its good safety and long-term memory 
ability. Discouragingly, low patient response rates and potential immune-related 
side effects make it rather challenging to literally bring immunotherapy from 
bench to bedside. However, it has become evident that, although the 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in 
facilitating tumor progression and metastasis, it also provides various 
potential targets for remodeling the immunosuppressive TME, which can 
consequently bolster the effectiveness of antitumor response and tumor 
suppression. Additionally, the particular characteristics of TME, in turn, can 
be exploited as avenues for designing diverse precise targeting nanomedicines. 
In general, it is of urgent necessity to deliver nanomedicines for remodeling 
the immunosuppressive TME, thus improving the therapeutic outcomes and clinical 
translation prospects of immunotherapy. Herein, we will illustrate several 
formation mechanisms of immunosuppressive TME. More importantly, a variety of 
strategies concerning remodeling immunosuppressive TME and strengthening 
patients' immune systems, will be reviewed. Ultimately, we will discuss the 
existing obstacles and future perspectives in the development of antitumor 
immunotherapy. Hopefully, the thriving bloom of immunotherapy will bring 
vibrancy to further exploration of comprehensive cancer treatment."
1160,"We present a new strategy for self-adjuvanting vaccine development that has 
different types of covalently-linked immunostimulants as the carrier molecule. 
Using Tn antigen as the model, a three-component vaccine (MPLA-Tn-KRN7000) 
containing the TLR4 ligand MPLA and the iNKT cell agonist KRN7000 was designed 
and synthesized. This expands fully synthetic self-adjuvanting vaccine studies 
that use a single carrier to one with two different types of carriers. The 
corresponding two-component conjugate vaccines Tn-MPLA, Tn-KRN7000 and Tn-CRM197 
were also synthesized, as controls. The immunological evaluation found that 
MPLA-Tn-KRN7000 elicits robust Tn-specific and T cell-dependent immunity. The 
antibodies specifically recognized, bound to and exhibited complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity against Tn-positive cancer cells. In addition, MPLA-Tn-KRN7000 
increased the survival rate and survival time of tumor-challenged mice, and 
surviving mice reject further tumor attacks without any additional treatment. 
Compared to the glycoprotein vaccine Tn-CRM197, the two-component conjugate 
vaccines, Tn-MPLA and Tn-KRN7000, and the physical mixture of Tn-MPLA and 
Tn-KRN7000, MPLA-Tn-KRN7000 showed the most effect at combating tumor cells both 
in vitro and in vivo. The comparison of immunological studies in wild-type and 
TLR4 knockout mice, along with the test of binding affinity to CD1d protein 
suggests that the covalently linked MPLA-KRN7000 immunostimulant induces a 
synergistic activation of TLR4 and iNKT cell that improves the immunogenicity of 
Tn. This work demonstrates that MPLA-Tn-KRN7000 has the potential to be a 
vaccine candidate and provides a new direction for fully synthetic vaccine 
design."
1161,"Chemoresistance remains a major obstacle to successful treatment of triple 
negative breast cancer (TNBC). Identification of druggable vulnerabilities is an 
important aim for TNBC therapy. Here, we report that SERCA2 expression 
correlates with TNBC progression in human patients, which promotes TNBC cell 
proliferation, migration and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, SERCA2 interacts 
with LC3B via LIR motif, facilitating WIPI2-independent autophagosome formation 
to induce autophagy. Autophagy-mediated SERCA2 degradation induces SERCA2 
transactivation through a Ca2+/CaMKK/CREB-1 feedback. Moreover, we found that 
SERCA2-targeting small molecule RL71 enhances SERCA2-LC3B interaction and 
induces excessive autophagic cell death. The increase in SERCA2 expression 
predisposes TNBC cells to RL71-induced autophagic cell death in vitro and 
in vivo. This study elucidates a mechanism by which TNBC cells maintain their 
high autophagy activity to induce chemoresistance, and suggests increased SERCA2 
expression as a druggable vulnerability for TNBC."
1162,"We report the inverse association between the expression of androgen receptor 
(AR) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) in a cohort of patients with metastatic 
castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We also discovered that AR 
represses the IL-1β gene by binding an androgen response element (ARE) half-site 
located within the promoter, which explains the IL-1β expression in AR-negative 
(ARNEG) cancer cells. Consistently, androgen-depletion or AR-pathway inhibitors 
(ARIs) de-repressed IL-1β in ARPOS cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. The 
AR transcriptional repression is sustained by histone de-acetylation at the 
H3K27 mark in the IL-1β promoter. Notably, patients' data suggest that DNA 
methylation prevents IL-1β expression, even if the AR-signaling axis is 
inactive. Our previous studies show that secreted IL-1β supports metastatic 
progression in mice by altering the transcriptome of tumor-associated bone 
stroma. Thus, in prostate cancer patients harboring ARNEG tumor cells or treated 
with ADT/ARIs, and with the IL-1β gene unmethylated, IL-1β could condition the 
metastatic microenvironment to sustain disease progression."
1163,"Inflammatory edema formation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (neutrophil) 
accumulation are common components of cutaneous vascular inflammation, and their 
assessment is a powerful investigative and drug development tool but typically 
requires independent cohorts of animals to assess each. We have established the 
use of a mathematical formula to estimate the ellipsoidal-shaped volume of the 
edematous wheal or bleb after intradermal injections of substances in mice 
pretreated intravenously with Evans blue dye (which binds to plasma albumin) to 
act as an edema marker. Whereas previous extraction of Evans blue dye with 
formamide is suitable for all strains of mice, we report this quicker and more 
reliable assessment of edema volume in situ. This therefore allows neutrophil 
accumulation to be assessed from the same mouse using the myeloperoxidase assay. 
Importantly, we examined the influence of Evans blue dye on the spectrometry 
readout at the wavelength at which myeloperoxidase activity is measured. The 
results indicate that it is feasible to quantify edema formation and neutrophil 
accumulation in the same mouse skin site. Thus, we show techniques that can 
assess edema formation and neutrophil accumulation at the same site in the same 
mouse, allowing paired measurements and reducing the total use of mice by 50%."
1164,"In response to the first COVID-19 surge in 2020, secondary care outpatient 
services were rapidly reconfigured to provide specialist review for disease 
sequelae. At our institution, comprising hospitals across three sites in London, 
we initially implemented a COVID-19 follow-up pathway that was in line with 
expert opinion at the time but more intensive than initial clinical guidelines 
suggested. We retrospectively evaluated the resource requirements for this 
service, which supported 526 patients from April 2020 to October 2020. At the 
6-week review, 193/403 (47.9%) patients reported persistent breathlessness, 
46/336 (13.7%) desaturated on exercise testing, 167/403 (41.4%) were discharged 
from COVID-19-related secondary care services and 190/403 (47.1%) needed 12-week 
follow-up. At the 12-week review, 113/309 (36.6%) patients reported persistent 
breathlessness, 30/266 (11.3%) desaturated on exercise testing and 150/309 
(48.5%) were discharged from COVID-19-related secondary care services. Referrals 
were generated to multiple medical specialties, particularly respiratory 
subspecialties. Our analysis allowed us to justify rationalising and 
streamlining provisions for subsequent COVID-19 waves while reassured that 
opportunities for early intervention were not being missed."
1165,"In oncological outpatient settings, patients often require nutritional support 
after they have developed malnutrition. A delayed dietetic referral can lead to 
increased difficulties in providing therapies and surgery, and to poorer patient 
outcomes. The audit described in this article aimed to assess the frequency and 
completeness of patient record documentation of anthropometric measurements in a 
day treatment unit (DTU) in a single cancer centre in the UK. The underlying 
goal was to improve anthropometry monitoring procedures to ensure that 
documentation is sufficient to indicate weight loss and, hence, allow timely 
referrals for nutrition support. The results show that, for over 80% of 
patients, it was not possible to identify a weight trend between the latest two 
treatments received at the hospital. The audit findings highlight the need to 
improve malnutrition monitoring and to ensure patient records contain updated 
and accurate anthropometric measurements in order to facilitate medical staff to 
recognise early malnutrition risk and refer for appropriate nutritional support 
when needed."
1166,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies demonstrate that titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 
NPs) are an effective source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for photodynamic 
therapy and radionuclide stimulated dynamic therapy (RaST). Unfortunately 
tracking the in vivo distribution of TiO2 NPs noninvasively remains elusive.
OBJECTIVE: Given the use of gadolinium (Gd) chelates as effective contrast 
agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this study aims to (1) develop 
hybrid TiO2-Gd NPs that exhibit high relaxivity for tracking the NPs without 
loss of ROS generating capacity; and (2) establish a simple colorimetric assay 
for quantifying Gd loading and stability.
METHODS: A chelate-free, heat-induced method was used to load Gd onto TiO2 NPs, 
which was coated with transferrin (Tf). A sensitive colorimetric assay and 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were used to determine Gd 
loading and stability of the TiO2-Gd-Tf NPs. Measurement of the relaxivity was 
performed on a 1.4 T relaxometer and a 4.7 T small animal magnetic resonance 
scanner to estimate the effects of magnetic field strength. ROS was quantified 
by activated dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate fluorescence. Cell uptake of 
the NPs and RaST were monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Both 3 T and 4.7 T 
scanners were used to image the in vivo distribution of intravenously injected 
NPs in tumor-bearing mice.
RESULTS: A simple colorimetric assay accurately determined both the loading and 
stability of the NPs compared with the expensive and complex ICP-MS method. 
Coating of the TiO2-Gd NPs with Tf stabilized the nanoconstruct and minimized 
aggregation. The TiO2-Gd-Tf maintained ROS-generating capability without 
inducing cell death at a wide range of concentrations but induced significant 
cell death under RaST conditions in the presence of F-18 radiolabeled 
2-fluorodeoxyglucose. The longitudinal (r1 = 10.43 mM-1s-1) and transverse (r2 = 
13.43 mM-1s-1) relaxivity of TiO2-Gd-Tf NPs were about twice and thrice, 
respectively, those of clinically used Gd contrast agent (Gd-DTPA; r1 = 3.77 
mM-1s-1 and r2 = 5.51 mM-1s-1) at 1.4 T. While the r1 (8.13 mM-1s-1) reduced to 
about twice that of Gd-DTPA (4.89 mM-1s-1) at 4.7 T, the corresponding r2 (87.15 
mM-1s-1) increased by a factor 22.6 compared to Gd-DTPA (r2 = 3.85). MRI of 
tumor-bearing mice injected with TiO2-Gd-Tf NPs tracked the NPs distribution and 
accumulation in tumors.
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that Arsenazo III colorimetric assay can 
substitute ICP-MS for determining the loading and stability of Gd-doped TiO2 
NPs. The new nanoconstruct enabled RaST effect in cells, exhibited high 
relaxivity, and enhanced MRI contrast in tumors in vivo, paving the way for in 
vivo MRI-guided RaST."

    Editorial on the Research Topic Stromal and immune microenvironment in 
breast cancer metastasis."
1168,"INTRODUCTION: Brain metastases (BM) severely affect the prognosis and quality of 
life of patients with NSCLC. Recently, molecularly targeted agents were found to 
have promising activity against BM in patients with NSCLC whose primary tumors 
carry ""druggable"" mutations. Nevertheless, it remains critical to identify 
specific pathogenic alterations that drive NSCLC-BM and that can provide novel 
and more effective therapeutic targets.
METHODS: To identify potentially targetable pathogenic alterations in NSCLC-BM, 
we profiled somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) in 51 matched pairs of 
primary NSCLC and BM samples from 33 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 18 
patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, we performed 
multiregion copy number profiling on 15 BM samples and whole-exome sequencing on 
40 of 51 NSCLC-BM pairs.
RESULTS: BM consistently had a higher burden of SCNAs compared with the matched 
primary tumors, and SCNAs were typically homogeneously distributed within BM, 
suggesting BM do not undergo extensive evolution once formed. By comparing focal 
SCNAs in matched NSCLC-BM pairs, we identified putative BM-driving alterations 
affecting multiple cancer genes, including several potentially targetable 
alterations in genes such as CDK12, DDR2, ERBB2, and NTRK1, which we validated 
in an independent cohort of 84 BM samples. Finally, we identified putative 
pathogenic alterations in multiple cancer genes, including genes involved in 
epigenome editing and 3D genome organization, such as EP300, CTCF, and STAG2, 
which we validated by targeted sequencing of an independent cohort of 115 BM 
samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study represents the most comprehensive genomic 
characterization of NSCLC-BM available to date, paving the way to functional 
studies aimed at assessing the potential of the identified pathogenic 
alterations as clinical biomarkers and targets."
1169,"The objective of this study was to determine high value questions for early 
detection and prevention of head and neck cancer by querying content experts on 
patient risk factors relevant to local communities in Southeast Asia (i.e., 
Vietnam, Laos, China, and Singapore). The Delphi method was employed using three 
rounds of asynchronous surveying which included participants among five 
different collaborating medical centers. 60 total survey items were assessed for 
consensus defined by a priori measures on the relative level of value of these 
questions for use in head and neck cancer screening. 77% of items reached a 
consensus and no items were concluded to be of low value despite differences in 
conclusions regarding relative importance. Survey items focused on patient 
demographic information and physical examination were examined across variables 
such as expert department affiliation, academic designation, and years of 
experience and found to be without statistically significant differences. 
However, with consensus items related to social risk factors, it was determined 
that participants who had 15 or more years of experience or identified as 
otolaryngologists rated these items at a relatively lower value than their peers 
with less experience (p < 0.0001, p = 0.0017) or outside the field of 
otolaryngology (p = 0.0101). This study explicitly identifies patient variables 
to consider in head and neck cancer screening that have not previously been 
comprehensively or methodically assessed in current literature. Increasing 
awareness of these risk factors may benefit the design and implementation of 
future head and neck cancer early detection and prevention programs in Southeast 
Asia and beyond as well as positively impact head and neck cancer outcomes."
1170,"PURPOSE: Immune system modulation, with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, 
has drastically changed the field of oncology. Strong preclinical data indicate 
that radiation therapy (RT) may enhance the response rate to such drugs via in 
situ vaccination, although these data do not consider immune radiotoxicity. This 
meta-analysis investigates whether radio-induced lymphopenia (RIL) is associated 
with overall survival (OS).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A systematic literature search and quantitative analysis 
were planned, conducted, and reported per the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses 
checklists. The literature from January 1990 to March 2021 was searched to 
identify clinical studies with OS data in patients treated with RT and 
presenting with lymphopenia. A random-effect model was employed for the 
meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Publication 
bias was estimated using a P-curve analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 56 studies with 13 223 patients and 11 types of cancers were 
selected. The mean follow-up time was 35.9 months. Over a third of patients had 
RIL (37.25%). After removing outlying studies (n = 14), the between-study 
heterogeneity variance was estimated at t2 = 0.018 (P = .01) with an I2 value of 
36.0% (95% confidence interval, 6%-56%). The results showed that RIL was 
significantly associated with worse OS (hazard ratio: 1.70; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.55-1.86; P < .01; 95% prediction interval, 1.27-2.26). A subgroup 
analysis was performed based on the type of primary tumor, and a difference 
between the subgroups was found (P < .01). Based on the P-curve analysis, a 
significant evidential value was found, and no significant publication bias was 
identified among the studies.
CONCLUSIONS: RIL is a significant prognostic factor for mortality in virtually 
all solid cancers. Pooled-effect estimates indicate a significantly reduced risk 
of death in patients without RIL. Tailoring RT regimens to spare the immune 
system and updating dosimetric constraints for new organs at risk, such as major 
blood vessels, organs with rich blood supplies, bones, and all lymph node areas, 
may improve prognoses."

1172,"Publisher: BACKGROUND AND AIM: COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by 
SARS-CoV-2 virus that has been causing a severe pandemic worldwide for more than 
2 years, is characterized by a high heterogeneity of clinical presentations and 
evolution and, particularly, by a varying severity of respiratory involvement. 
This study aimed to analyze the diversity and taxonomic composition of the gut 
microbiota at hospital admission, in order to evaluate its association with 
COVID-19 outcome. In particular, the association between gut microbiota and a 
combination of several clinical covariates was analyzed in order to characterize 
the bacterial signature associate to mild or severe symptoms during the 
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: V3–V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 
97 rectal swabs from a retrospective cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients 
was employed to study the gut microbiota composition. Patients were divided in 
two groups according to their outcome considering the respiratory supports they 
needed during hospital stay: (i) group “mild,” including 47 patients with a good 
prognosis and (ii) group “severe,” including 50 patients who experienced a more 
severe disease due to severe respiratory distress that required non-invasive or 
invasive ventilation. Identification of the clusters of bacterial population 
between patients with mild or severe outcome was assessed by PEnalized LOgistic 
Regression Analysis (PELORA).
RESULTS: Although no changes for Chao1 and Shannon index were observed between 
the two groups a significant greater proportion of Campylobacterota and 
Actinobacteriota at phylum level was found in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 
infection who developed a more severe disease characterized by respiratory 
distress requiring invasive or non-invasive ventilation. Clusters have been 
identified with a useful early potential prognostic marker of the disease 
evolution.
DISCUSSION: Microorganisms residing within the gut of the patients at hospital 
admission, were able to significantly discriminate the clinical evolution of 
COVID-19 patients, in particular who will develop mild or severe respiratory 
involvement. Our data show that patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 with mild or 
severe symptoms display different gut microbiota profiles which can be exploited 
as potential prognostic biomarkers paving also the way to new integrative 
therapeutic approaches."
1173,"COVID-19 appeared in December 2019, needing efforts of science. Besides, a range 
of light therapies (PDT, Ultraviolet UV, Laser) has shown scientific 
alternatives to conventional decontamination therapies. METHODS: Investigating 
the efficacy of light-based therapies for environment decontamination against 
SARS-CoV2, a PRISMA systematic review of Phototherapies against SARS-CoV or 
MERS-CoV species discussing changes in viral RT-PCR was done. After searching 
MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and LILACS we have found studies about cell cultures 
irradiation (18), blood components irradiation (10), N95 masks decontamination 
(03), inanimate surface decontamination (03), aerosols decontamination (03), 
hospital rooms irradiation (01) with PDT, LED, and UV therapy. The best quality 
results showed an effective low time and dose UV irradiation for environments 
and inanimate surfaces without human persons as long as the devices have safety 
elements dependent on the surfaces, viral charge, humidity, radiant exposure. To 
interpersonal contamination in humans, PDT or LED therapy seems very promising 
and are encouraged."
1174,"BACKGROUND: Multiple authors have described an initial learning curve (LC) for 
robotic proctectomy (RP), but there is scant literature regarding continued 
technical progression beyond this stage. Total operating time is the most 
commonly used metric to measure proficiency. Our goal was to examine RP 
experience after the initial LC looking for evidence of further technical 
progression.
METHODS: We reviewed our robotic surgery database for a single surgeon during 
operations 100 through 550 to identify 83 RPs for tumor. These were divided into 
quartiles by series order, indicating surgeon experience level over time. 
Demographics and outcomes were compared among the groups. We defined percent 
console time (PCT) as a new metric. PCT was defined as console time divided by 
total operative time (TOT).
RESULTS: From March 2014 through March 2019, 450 robotic colorectal operations 
were performed, including 83 RPs for polyp or cancer. No significant differences 
were found among the quartiles in regard to demographics, tumor features, 
hospital stay, conversions, or readmissions. As experience was gained, there 
were significant increases in intracorporeal anastomosis (ICA), TOT, and PCT. 
Complications decreased with experience. Number of lymph nodes in the specimen 
increased. On multivariate analysis, later experience group, body mass index 
≥30, and ICA were associated with increased PCT.
DISCUSSION: ICA became a routine part of RP after the initial LC, with increases 
in TOT and PCT. Number of lymph nodes increased and number and severity of 
complications decreased with experience. Increased PCT may indicate increased 
expertise during RP."
1175,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are epithelial malignancies that can arise from 
multiple tissues. Gastrointestinal (GI) NETs are the most common; in this review 
of extra-abdominal carcinoid tumors, we focus our discussion on bronchial and 
thymic carcinoid tumors. Bronchial carcinoid tumors comprise a quarter of all 
NETs and less than 2% of all lung cancers. Thymic carcinoid tumors are extremely 
rare, accounting for 5% of thymic tumors. Both bronchial and thymic carcinoid 
tumors are histologically classified as either typical or atypical based on 
their mitotic rate (less than 2 or 2-10 mitoses per 10 high-powered fields 
(HPF), respectively). Both bronchial and thymic carcinoids can present with 
symptoms of obstruction and potentially carcinoid syndrome. The gold standard of 
management of bronchial and thymic carcinoid tumors is surgical resection. For 
patients with advanced disease, first-line systemic therapy is generally 
somatostatin analog monotherapy with octreotide or lanreotide. In patients with 
refractory disease, therapy generally involves peptide receptor radioligand 
therapy, everolimus, or cytotoxic chemotherapy. There are ongoing, prospective 
trials comparing the mainstays of systemic therapy for these patients, as well 
as ongoing evaluations of immune checkpoint inhibitors and multi-kinase 
inhibitors. Prognosis for both bronchial and thymic carcinoid tumors depends on 
histologic grade, local versus invasive disease, and extent of metastases. 
Herein we provide a summary of the pathophysiologic and clinical background, the 
current state of the field in diagnosis and management, and note of key ongoing 
prospective trials for patients with bronchial and thymic carcinoid tumors."
1176,"OBJECTIVE: To study the survival prediction value of lymph node ratio (LNR) and 
preoperative thyroglobulin (Tg) in the prognosis of thyroid papillary carcinoma 
(PTC).
METHODS: A total of 495 patients with PTC and lymph node metastasis treated at 
the Cancer Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University were selected for a 
retrospective study. The disease-free survival (DFS) of patients was the 
follow-up endpoint. DFS was calculated for all patients. The Cox proportional 
risk regression model and nomogram were used to predict the survival prognosis 
of PTC with lymph node metastasis by index. LNR and preoperative Tg level cutoff 
values were obtained using ROC curves. To express DFS, Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves were created. Using 3- and 5-year calibration curves and AUC values, the 
prognostic models' precision and discrimination were assessed. Clinical decision 
curve analysis was used to forecast clinical benefitability. Finally, the 
results were validated using internal cross-validation.
RESULTS: The cutoff values of LNR and preoperative Tg level were 0.295 and 
50.24, respectively, and they were divided into two groups according to the 
cutoff values. Multifactorial Cox regression models showed that NLNM, LNR, and 
preoperative Tg level (all p < 0.05) were independent risk factors affecting the 
prognosis of PTC with lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier curves showed higher 
DFS rates in the group with low NLNM (<10), LNR (<0.295), and preoperative Tg 
level (<50.24) groups. The 3-year and 5-year calibration curves showed good 
agreement. A ROC curve analysis was performed on the nomogram model, and its AUC 
values at 3 and 5 years were, respectively, 0.805 and 0.793. Clinical decision 
curves indicate good clinical benefit. Finally, internal cross-validation 
demonstrated the legitimacy of the prognostic model.
CONCLUSION: The LNR and preoperative Tg levels, in combination with other 
independent factors, were effective in predicting the survival prognosis for 
patients with PTC."
1177,"Approximately 50-55% of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) patients 
have MYC oncogenic pathway activation. As MYC is not directly targetable, we 
have analyzed molecular pathways enriched in MYC-high HGSOC tumors to identify 
potential therapeutic targets. Here, we report that MYC-high HGSOC tumors show 
enrichment in genes controlled by NRF2, antioxidant signaling pathway along with 
increased thioredoxin redox activity. Treatment of MYC-high HGSOC tumors cells 
with FDA-approved thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) inhibitor auranofin resulted 
in significant growth suppression and apoptosis in MYC-high HGSOC cells in 
vitro, and also significantly reduced tumor growth in a MYC-high HGSOC 
patient-derived tumor xenograft. We found that auranofin treatment inhibited 
glycolysis in MYC-high cells via oxidation-induced GAPDH inhibition. 
Interestingly, in response to auranofin-induced glycolysis inhibition, MYC-high 
HGSOC cells switched to glutamine metabolism for survival. Depletion of 
glutamine with either glutamine starvation or glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor 
CB-839 exerted synergistic anti-tumor activity with auranofin in HGSOC cells and 
OVCAR-8 cell line xenograft. These findings suggest that applying a combined 
therapy of GLS1 inhibitor and TrxR1 inhibitor could effectively treat MYC-high 
HGSOC patients."
1178,"AIM: There is no established consensus on the optimal surgical approach to 
para-aortic lymph node (PALN) dissection in patients with colorectal cancer 
(CRC). This study is aimed to demonstrate the technical and oncological safety 
of minimally invasive PALN dissection for left-sided colonic and rectal cancer 
patients with clinically suspected infrarenal PALN metastasis.
METHODS: 101 patients who underwent primary tumour resection and minimally 
invasive (laparoscopic n=92, robotic n= 9) PALN dissection for left-sided 
colonic and rectal cancer were included. Logistic regression analysis was used 
to identify risk factors for PALN metastasis. Survival outcomes were evaluated 
using Kaplan-Meier (log-rank) method.
RESULTS: PALN metastasis was pathologically confirmed in 23 patients (22.8%). 
Postoperative complications occurred in 22 patients (21.8%). Pathological N2 
stage (OR = 9.337, P = 0.003) and inferior mesenteric artery LN metastasis 
(OR = 7.499, P = 0.009) were independently associated with PALN metastasis. The 
median follow-up time was 32 months (range 3-92 months). In all patients, the 
5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 
76.1% and 69.5%, respectively. The 5-year OS and PFS rates in patients with PALN 
metastasis were 49.8% and 47.5%, respectively. Patients with PALN metastasis had 
lower 5-year OS (P = 0.023) and PFS rates (P = 0.035) compared with those 
without PALN metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive PALN dissection had acceptable postoperative 
complications and may be oncologically beneficial in selected patients with 
clinically suspicious PALN metastasis."
1179,"BACKGROUND: Accumulating studies have evaluated the association between MAP3K1 
polymorphisms and cancer prognosis. However, the results of these studies are 
conflicting. Given the potential impact of MAP3K1 rs889312 SNP on the prognosis 
of various cancers, this meta-analysis was performed to obtain solid and 
credible evidence.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study was performed according to the PRISMA 2020 
statement. A comprehensive article search was conducted to find and select 
articles from multiple databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of 
Science, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, published up to 15th September 2022. 
The data analysis was performed with Review Manager v5.2. Pooled HR with its 95% 
CI and p-value was calculated where HR >1 suggests worse/poor survival and HR <1 
suggests better survival of cancer patients.
RESULTS: A total of five articles comprising 24 439 patients were included for 
both qualitative and quantitative data synthesis. It was found that only the 
dominant genetic model (AC + CC vs. AA) showed a statistically significant poor 
overall survival for MAP3K1 rs889312 polymorphism (HR = 1.25, 95% 
CI = 1.06-1.47, p = .01). In addition, publication bias analysis by the Egger's 
test and the Begg-Mazumdar test reported no significant bias in the analysis of 
overall survival (p > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study concludes that MAP3K1 gene rs889312 polymorphism 
plays a prognostic role in the survival of cancer patients. However, future 
research is recommended that will analyze more MAP3K SNPs along with rs889312, 
which may reveal more credible outcomes in terms of cancer prognosis."
1180,"BACKGROUND: The clinical impact of prolonged steep Trendelenburg position and 
CO2 pneumoperitoneum during robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RC) on 
intraoperative conditions and immediate postoperative recovery remains to be 
assessed. The current study investigates intraoperative and immediate 
postoperative outcomes for open RC (ORC) versus robot-assisted RC with 
intracorporal urinary diversion (iRARC) in a blinded randomised trial. We 
hypothesised that ORC would result in a faster haemodynamic and respiratory 
post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU) recovery compared to iRARC.
METHODS: This study is a predefined sub-analysis of a single-centre, 
double-blinded, randomised feasibility study. Fifty bladder cancer patients were 
randomly assigned to ORC (n=25) or iRARC (n=25). Patients, PACU staff, and ward 
personnel were blinded to the surgical technique. Both randomisation arms 
followed the same anaesthesiologic procedure, fluid treatment plan, and PACU 
care. The primary outcome was immediate postoperative recovery using a 
standardised PACU Discharge Criteria (PACU-DC) score. Secondary outcomes 
included respiration- and arterial O2 saturation scores as well as perioperative 
interventions and recordings.
RESULTS: All patients underwent the allocated treatment. The total PACU-DC score 
was highest six hours postoperatively with no difference in the total score 
between randomisation arms (p=0.80). Both the ORC and iRARC groups maintained a 
mean respiration- and arterial O2 saturation score below 1 (out of 3) throughout 
PACU stay. The iRARC patients had significantly, but clinically acceptable, 
higher maximum airway pressure and arterial blood pressure, as well as lower 
minimum pH levels. The ORC group received significantly more opioids after 
extubation but marginally less analgesics in the PACU, compared to the iRARC 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: A prolonged Trendelenburg position and CO2 pneumoperitoneum was 
well-tolerated during iRARC, and immediate postoperative recovery was similar 
for ORC and iRARC patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

1181,"BACKGROUND Schwannoma is an uncommon benign tumor that develops from Schwann 
cells in the peripheral nervous system; 25-50% of such tumors occur in the head 
and neck. A rare variety of schwannoma, known as an ancient schwannoma, exhibits 
calcification, cystic degeneration, hemorrhage, myxoid stroma, pleomorphism, and 
nuclear hyperchromatism. Such characteristics may contribute to this tumor being 
incorrectly diagnosed as malignant. Almost all reported intra-oral ancient 
schwannomas behave innocuously. CASE REPORT A 20-year-old man presented to the 
oral surgery clinic with a right facial swelling that began a few months before. 
CT and MRI were performed and showed a well-defined cystic lesion anterior to 
the right masseter muscle, located in the subcutaneous area and measuring 
28×24×20 mm. No extension to the surrounding tissues nor any other similar 
lesions were seen. Microscopic examination revealed an encapsulated nodular mass 
with cystic cavities, hemorrhage, and variably distributed myxoid and hyalinized 
stroma. The tumor demonstrated 2 distinct cell distributions: hypercellular 
areas (Antoni A) and myxoid hypocellular areas (Antoni B). Focal areas in 
high-power magnification showed atypical cells with hyperchromatic and 
pleomorphic nuclei. The tumor cells showed diffuse positivity for S-100 in IHC. 
The diagnosis of ancient schwannoma was made. At 1-year follow-up, there was no 
evidence of nerve injury or recurrence. CONCLUSIONS One more case of oral 
ancient schwannoma is added to the literature. This is the first reported in 
Saudi Arabia. It is prudent to be familiar with the degenerative and cytologic 
alterations of ancient schwannoma, as this may limit the likelihood of 
misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment of this benign tumor, with an excellent 
prognosis."
1182,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a vital role in the progression and 
metastasis of glioma and is an important part of the tumor microenvironment. The 
matrisome is composed of ECM components and related proteins. There have been 
several studies on the effects of matrisomes on the glioma immune 
microenvironment, but most of these studies were performed on individual glioma 
immune-related matrisomes rather than integral analysis. Hence, an overall 
analysis of all potential immune-related matrisomes in gliomas is needed. Here, 
we divided 667 glioma patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database into 
low, moderate, and high immune infiltration groups. Immune-related matrisomes 
differentially expressed among the three groups were analyzed, and a risk 
signature was established. Eight immune-related matrisomes were screened, 
namely, LIF, LOX, MMP9, S100A4, SRPX2, SLIT1, SMOC1, and TIMP1. Kaplan Meier 
analysis, operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and nomogram were 
constructed to analyze the relationships between risk signatures and the 
prognosis of glioma patients. The risk signature was significantly correlated 
with the overall survival (OS) of glioma patients. Both high- and low-risk 
signatures were also associated with some immune checkpoints. In addition, 
analysis of somatic mutations and anti-PD1/L1 immunotherapy responses in the 
high- and low-risk groups showed that the high-risk group had worse prognosis 
and a higher response to anti-PD1/L1 immunotherapy.. Our analysis of 
immune-related matrisomes may improve understanding of the characteristics of 
the glioma immune microenvironment and provide direction for glioma 
immunotherapy development in the future."
1183,"BACKGROUND: Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) have been used as 
a tracer for sentinel lymph node (SLN) localization in breast cancer, 
demonstrating comparable performance to the combination of radioisotope (RI) and 
blue dye (BD).
METHODS: A systematic literature search and meta-analysis with subgroup and 
meta-regression analysis were undertaken to update the available evidence, 
assess technique evolution, and define knowledge gaps. Recommendations were made 
using the GRADE approach.
RESULTS: In 20 comparative studies, the detection rate was 97.5 per cent for 
SPIO and 96.5 per cent for RI ± BD (risk ratio 1.006, 95 per cent c.i. 0.992 to 
1.019; P = 0.376, high-certainty evidence). Neoadjuvant therapy, injection site, 
injection volume or nodal metastasis burden did not affect the detection rate, 
but injection over 24 h before surgery increased the detection rate on 
meta-regression. Concordance was 99.0 per cent and reverse concordance 97.1 per 
cent (rate difference 0.003, 95 per cent c.i. -0.009 to 0.015; P = 0.656, 
high-certainty evidence). Use of SPIO led to retrieval of slightly more SLNs 
(pooled mean 1.96 versus 1.89) with a higher nodal detection rate (94.1 versus 
83.5 per cent; RR 1.098, 1.058 to 1.140; P < 0.001; low-certainty evidence). In 
meta-regression, injection over 24 h before surgery increased the SPIO nodal 
yield over that of RI ± BD. The skin-staining rate was 30.8 per cent (very 
low-certainty evidence), and possibly prevented with use of smaller doses and 
peritumoral injection.
CONCLUSION: The performance of SPIO is comparable to that of RI ± BD. 
Preoperative injection increases the detection rate and nodal yield, without 
affecting concordance. Whether skin staining and MRI artefacts are reduced by 
lower dose and peritumoral injection needs to be investigated."
1184,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused 
considerable disruption worldwide. For efficient SARS-CoV-2 detection, new 
methods of rapid, non-invasive sampling are needed. This study aimed to 
investigate the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in a novel medium for gargle-lavage (GL) 
self-sampling and to compare the performance of SARS-CoV-2 detection in paired 
self-collected GL and clinician-obtained nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. The 
stability study for SARS-CoV-2 preservation in a novel medium was performed over 
14 days (4 °C, 24-27 °C, and 37 °C). In total, 494 paired GL and NPS samples 
were obtained at the University Hospital in Olomouc in April 2021. SARS-CoV-2 
detection in paired samples was performed with a SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid 
Detection Kit (Zybio, Chongqing Municipality, Chongqing, China), an Elecsys® 
SARS-CoV-2 Antigen assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and a 
SARS-CoV-2 Antigen ELISA (EUROIMMUN, Lübeck, Germany). The stability study 
demonstrated excellent SARS-CoV-2 preservation in the novel medium for 14 days. 
SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 55.7% of NPS samples and 55.7% of GL samples using 
rRT-PCR, with an overall agreement of 91.9%. The positive percent agreement 
(PPA) of the rRT-PCR in the GL samples was 92.7%, and the negative percent 
agreement (NPA) was 90.9%, compared with the NPS samples. The PPA of the rRT-PCR 
in the NPS and GL samples was 93.2% when all positive tests were used as the 
reference standard. Both antigen detection assays showed poor sensitivity 
compared to rRT-PCR (33.2% and 36.0%). rRT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 detection in 
self-collected GL samples had a similar PPA and NPA to that of NPSs. GL 
self-sampling offers a suitable and more comfortable alternative for SARS-CoV-2 
detection."
1185,"The incidence of high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV)-driven head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is on the rise globally. HR-HPV-driven HNSCC 
displays molecular and clinical characteristics distinct from HPV-uninvolved 
cases. Therapeutic strategies for HR-HPV-driven HNSCC are under investigation. 
HR-HPVs encode the oncogenes E6 and E7, which are essential in tumorigenesis. 
Meanwhile, involvement of E6 and E7 provides attractive targets for developing 
new therapeutic regimen. Here we will review some of the recent advancements 
observed in preclinical studies and clinical trials on HR-HPV-driven HNSCC, 
focusing on nanotechnology related methods. Materials science innovation leads 
to great improvement for cancer therapeutics including HNSCC. This article 
discusses HPV-E6 or -E7- based vaccines, based on plasmid, messenger RNA or 
peptide, at their current stage of development and testing as well as how 
nanoparticles can be designed to target and access cancer cells and activate 
certain immunology pathways besides serving as a delivery vehicle. 
Nanotechnology was also used for chemotherapy and photothermal treatment. Short 
interference RNA targeting E6/E7 showed some potential in animal models. Gene 
editing by CRISPR-CAS9 combined with other treatments has also been assessed. 
These advancements have the potential to improve the outcome in HR-HPV-driven 
HNSCC, however breakthroughs are still to be awaited with nanomedicine playing 
an important role."
1186,"The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has adopted the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. 
Several factors related to the non-suppression of HIV, including interruptions 
of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and opportunistic infections could affect and 
delay this projected epidemic goal. Human T-Cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) 
appears to be consistently associated with a high risk of opportunistic 
infections, an early onset of HTLV-1 and its associated pathologies, as well as 
a fast progression to the AIDS phase in co-infected individuals, when compared 
to HIV-1 or HTLV-1 mono-infected individuals. In Gabon, the prevalence of these 
two retroviruses is very high and little is known about HTLV-1 and the 
associated pathologies, leaving most of them underdiagnosed. Hence, HTLV-1/HIV-1 
co-infections could simultaneously imply a non-diagnosis of HIV-1 positive 
individuals having developed pathologies associated with HTLV-1, but also a high 
mortality rate among the co-infected individuals. All of these constitute 
potential obstacles to pursue targeted objectives. A systematic review was 
conducted to assess the negative impacts of HTLV-1/HIV-1 co-infections and 
related factors on the elimination of HIV/AIDS by 2030 in Gabon."
1187,"BACKGROUND: Combination therapy has been widely explored for oncolytic virus 
(OV), as it can be met with tumor resistance. The HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) 
panobinostat is a potent pan-deacetylase inhibitor which blocks multiple 
cancer-related pathways and reverses epigenetic events in cancer progression.
METHODS: In this study, oncolytic activity in vitro and antitumor therapeutic 
efficacy in vivo when combined with oHSV and panobinostat were investigated.
RESULTS: (1) Treatment with panobinostat enhanced oHSV propagation and 
cytotoxicity in human glioma A172 and squamous cell carcinoma SCC9 cells. (2) 
Combined treatment with oHSV and panobinostat enhanced virus replication 
mediated by the transcriptional downregulation of IFN-β- and IFN-responsive 
antiviral genes in human glioma A172 and squamous cell carcinoma SCC9 cells. (3) 
Panobinostat treatment induced upregulation of PD-L1 expression in both glioma 
and squamous cell carcinoma cells. (4) A significantly enhanced therapeutic 
efficacy was shown in vivo for the murine glioma CT-2A and squamous cell 
carcinoma SCC7 models when treated with a combination of oHSV, including 
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and HDAC inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, these data provide some new clues for the clinical 
development of combination therapy with OVs, epigenetic modifiers, and 
checkpoint blockades for glioma and squamous cell carcinoma."

with human breast cancer over 50 years ago [...]."
1189,"Epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), defined by co-infection with Human Herpes Virus 
8 (HHV-8) and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), is a major cause of 
mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly 
reduces the risk of developing KS, and for those with KS, tumors frequently 
resolve with ART alone. However, for unknown reasons, a significant number of KS 
cases do not resolve and can progress to death. To explore how HIV responds to 
ART in the KS tumor microenvironment, we sequenced HIV env-nef found in DNA and 
RNA isolated from plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and tumor 
biopsies, before and after ART, in four Ugandan study participants who had 
unresponsive or progressive KS after 180-250 days of ART. We performed 
immunohistochemistry experiments to detect viral proteins in matched 
formalin-fixed tumor biopsies. Our sequencing results showed that HIV diversity 
and RNA expression in KS tumors are maintained after ART, despite undetectable 
plasma viral loads. The presence of spliced HIV transcripts in KS tumors after 
ART was consistent with a transcriptionally active viral reservoir. 
Immunohistochemistry staining found colocalization of HIV Nef protein and 
tissue-resident macrophages in the KS tumors. Overall, our results demonstrated 
that even after ART reduced plasma HIV viral load to undetectable levels and 
restored immune function, HIV in KS tumors continues to be transcriptionally and 
translationally active, which could influence tumor maintenance and progression."
1190,"Cancer induced by a viral infection is among the leading causes of cancer. 
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a hepatotropic oncogenic positive-sense RNA virus 
that leads to chronic infection, exposing the liver to a continuous process of 
damage and regeneration and promoting hepatocarcinogenesis. The virus promotes 
the development of carcinogenesis through indirect and direct molecular 
mechanisms such as chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, steatosis, genetic 
alterations, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, proliferation, and apoptosis, 
among others. Recently, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) showed sustained 
virologic response in 95% of cases. Nevertheless, patients treated with DAAs 
have reported an unexpected increase in the early incidence of Hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). Studies suggest that HCV induces epigenetic regulation through 
non-coding RNAs, DNA methylation, and chromatin remodeling, which modify gene 
expressions and induce genomic instability related to HCC development that 
persists with the infection's clearance. The need for a better understanding of 
the molecular mechanisms associated with the development of carcinogenesis is 
evident. The aim of this review was to unravel the molecular pathways involved 
in the development of carcinogenesis before, during, and after the viral 
infection's resolution, and how these pathways were regulated by the virus, to 
find control points that can be used as potential therapeutic targets."
1191,"The inadequate therapeutic opportunities associated with carbapenem-resistant 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) clinical isolates impose a search for innovative 
strategies. Therefore, our study aimed to characterize and evaluate two locally 
isolated phages formulated in a hydrogel, both in vitro and in vivo, against 
CRPA clinical isolates. The two phages were characterized by genomic, 
microscopic, phenotypic characterization, genomic analysis, in vitro and in vivo 
analysis in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected skin thermal injury rat model. The 
two siphoviruses belong to class Caudovirectes and were named vB_Pae_SMP1 and 
vB_Pae_SMP5. Each phage had an icosahedral head of 60 ± 5 nm and a flexible, 
non-contractile tail of 170 ± 5 nm long, while vB_Pae_SMP5 had an additional 
base plate containing a 35 nm fiber observed at the end of the tail. The 
hydrogel was prepared by mixing 5% w/v carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) into the 
CRPA propagated phage lysate containing phage titer 108 PFU/mL, pH of 7.7, and a 
spreadability coefficient of 25. The groups were treated with either Phage 
vB_Pae_SMP1, vB_Pae_SMP5, or a two-phage cocktail hydrogel cellular subepidermal 
granulation tissues with abundant records of fibroblastic activity and mixed 
inflammatory cell infiltrates and showed 17.2%, 25.8%, and 22.2% records of 
dermal mature collagen fibers, respectively. In conclusion, phage vB_Pae_SMP1 or 
vB_Pae_SMP5, or the two-phage cocktails formulated as hydrogels, were able to 
manage the infection of CRPA in burn wounds, and promoted healing at the injury 
site, as evidenced by the histopathological examination, as well as a decrease 
in animal mortality rate. Therefore, these phage formulae can be considered 
promising for clinical investigation in humans for the management of 
CRPA-associated skin infections."
1192,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genera alphacoronavirus, 
causes acute watery diarrhea and dehydration in suckling piglets and results in 
enormous economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. Identification and 
characterization of different cell lines are not only invaluable for PEDV entry 
and replication studies but also important for the development of various types 
of biological pharmaceuticals against PEDV. In this study, we present an 
approach to identify suitable permissive cell lines for PEDV research. Human 
cell lines were screened for a high correlation coefficient with the established 
PEDV infection model Huh7 based on RNA-seq data from the Cancer Cell Line 
Encyclopedia (CCLE). Experimentally testing permissiveness towards PEDV 
infection, three highly permissive human cell lines, HepG2, Hep3B217, and SNU387 
were identified. The replication kinetics of PEDV in HepG2, Hep3B217, and SNU387 
cells were similar to that in Vero and Huh7 cells. Additionally, the 
transcriptomes analysis showed robust induction of transcripts associated with 
the innate immune in response to PEDV infection in all three cell lines, 
including hundreds of inflammatory cytokine and interferon genes. Moreover, the 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and interferons were confirmed by qPCR 
assay. Our findings indicate that HepG2, Hep3B217, and SNU387 are suitable cell 
lines for PEDV replication and innate immune response studies."
1193,"COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS 
CoV-2), is estimated to have caused over 6.5 million deaths worldwide. The 
emergence of fast-evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern alongside increased 
transmissibility and/or virulence, as well as immune and vaccine escape 
capabilities, highlight the urgent need for more effective antivirals to combat 
the disease in the long run along with regularly updated vaccine boosters. One 
of the early risk factors identified during the COVID-19 pandemic was that men 
are more likely to become infected by the virus, more likely to develop severe 
disease and exhibit a higher likelihood of hospitalisation and mortality rates 
compared to women. An association exists between SARS-CoV-2 infectiveness and 
disease severity with sex steroid hormones and, in particular, androgens. 
Several studies underlined the importance of the androgen-mediated regulation of 
the host protease TMPRSS2 and the cell entry protein ACE2, as well as the key 
role of these factors in the entry of the virus into target cells. In this 
context, modulating androgen signalling is a promising strategy to block viral 
infection, and antiandrogens could be used as a preventative measure at the pre- 
or early hospitalisation stage of COVID-19 disease. Different antiandrogens, 
including commercial drugs used to treat metastatic castration-sensitive 
prostate cancer and other conditions, have been tested as antivirals with 
varying success. In this review, we summarise the most recent updates concerning 
the use of antiandrogens as prophylactic and therapeutic options for COVID-19."
1194,"An adenoviral (AdV)-based vector system is a promising platform for vaccine 
development and gene therapy applications. Administration of an AdV vector 
elicits robust innate immunity, leading to the development of humoral and 
cellular immune responses against the vector and the transgene antigen, if 
applicable. The use of high doses (1011-1013 virus particles) of an AdV vector, 
especially for gene therapy applications, could lead to vector toxicity due to 
excessive levels of innate immune responses, vector interactions with blood 
factors, or high levels of vector transduction in the liver and spleen. 
Additionally, the high prevalence of AdV infections in humans or the first 
inoculation with the AdV vector result in the development of vector-specific 
immune responses, popularly known as preexisting vector immunity. It 
significantly reduces the vector efficiency following the use of an AdV vector 
that is prone to preexisting vector immunity. Several approaches have been 
developed to overcome this problem. The utilization of rare human AdV types or 
nonhuman AdVs is the primary strategy to evade preexisting vector immunity. The 
use of heterologous viral vectors, capsid modification, and vector encapsulation 
are alternative methods to evade vector immunity. The vectors can be optimized 
for clinical applications with comprehensive knowledge of AdV vector immunity, 
toxicity, and circumvention strategies."

cancer, analysis of HR-HPV-infected women could help to predict who is at risk 
of acquiring cervical cancer. Therefore, to improve HR-HPVs detection, we used 
the FDA-approved cobas® 4800 HPV and REBA HPV-ID® HPV assays to detect HR-HPVs 
in colposcopy-derived cervical cells from 303 patients, detecting 72.28% (219) 
and 71.62% (217) of HR-HPVs positive cases, with HPV16 detection rates of 35.64% 
(108) and 30.69% (93), respectively. Of the HPV16-positive cases, cobas® 4800 
and REBA HPV-ID® identified 28.81% (51) and 25.42% (45) of the CIN1 cases, and 
55% (33) and 50% (30) of the 60 CIN2/3 cases, respectively. HPV-diagnostic 
concordance was 82.17% overall (kappa = 0.488), 87.45% for HR-HPVs (kappa = 
0.689), and 88.33% for CIN2/3 (kappa = 0.51). The HR-HPVs detection rates of 
these assays were comparable. Our findings reveal that the FDA-approved HR-HPVs 
detection assay is appropriate for screening women with HR-HPVs infection, and 
for predicting increased risk of cervical cancer progression. REBA HPV-ID® can 
be used to detect low risk-HPV types in high-grade cervical lesions that are 
HR-HPV negative as well as in the distribution of HPV types."
1196,"Positive-strand RNA virus RNA genome replication occurs in membrane-associated 
RNA replication complexes (RCs). Nodavirus RCs are outer mitochondrial membrane 
invaginations whose necked openings to the cytosol are ""crowned"" by a 12-fold 
symmetrical proteinaceous ring that functions as the main engine of RNA 
replication. Similar protein crowns recently visualized at the openings of 
alphavirus and coronavirus RCs highlight their broad conservation and functional 
importance. Using cryo-EM tomography, we earlier showed that the major nodavirus 
crown constituent is viral protein A, whose polymerase, RNA capping, membrane 
interaction and multimerization domains drive RC formation and function. Other 
viral proteins are strong candidates for unassigned EM density in the crown. 
RNA-binding RNAi inhibitor protein B2 co-immunoprecipitates with protein A and 
could form crown subdomains that protect nascent viral RNA and dsRNA templates. 
Capsid protein may interact with the crown since nodavirus virion assembly has 
spatial and other links to RNA replication. Using cryoelectron tomography and 
complementary approaches, we show that, even when formed in mammalian cells, 
nodavirus RC crowns generated without B2 and capsid proteins are functional and 
structurally indistinguishable from mature crowns in infected Drosophila cells 
expressing all viral proteins. Thus, the only nodaviral factors essential to 
form functional RCs and crowns are RNA replication protein A and an RNA 
template. We also resolve apparent conflicts in prior results on B2 localization 
in infected cells, revealing at least two distinguishable pools of B2. The 
results have significant implications for crown structure, assembly, function 
and control as an antiviral target."
1197,"The two human tumor viruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi 
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), have been mostly studied in isolation. 
Recent studies suggest that co-infection with both viruses as observed in one of 
their associated malignancies, namely primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), might 
also be required for KSHV persistence. In this review, we discuss how EBV and 
KSHV might support each other for persistence and lymphomagenesis. Moreover, we 
summarize what is known about their innate and adaptive immune control which 
both seem to be required to ensure asymptomatic persistent co-infection with 
these two human tumor viruses. A better understanding of this immune control 
might allow us to prepare for vaccination against EBV and KSHV in the future."
1198,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic human herpesvirus infecting 
approximately 90% of the world's population. The oral cavity serves a central 
role in the life cycle, transmission, and pathogenesis of EBV. Transmitted to a 
new host via saliva, EBV circulates between cellular compartments within oral 
lymphoid tissues. Epithelial cells primarily support productive viral 
replication, while B lymphocytes support viral latency and reactivation. EBV 
infections are typically asymptomatic and benign; however, the latent virus is 
associated with multiple lymphomas and carcinomas arising in the oral cavity. 
EBV association with cancer is complex as histologically similar cancers often 
test negative for the virus. However, the presence of EBV is associated with 
distinct features in certain cancers. The intrinsic ability of EBV to 
immortalize B-lymphocytes, via manipulation of survival and growth signaling, 
further implicates the virus as an oncogenic cofactor. A distinct mutational 
profile and burden have been observed in EBV-positive compared to EBV-negative 
tumors, suggesting that viral infection can drive alternative pathways that 
converge on oncogenesis. Taken together, EBV is also an important prognostic 
biomarker that can direct alternative therapeutic approaches. Here, we discuss 
the prevalence of EBV in oral malignancies and the EBV-dependent mechanisms 
associated with tumorigenesis."
1199,"The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the most common cause of 
neurodegenerative disease in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific region; 
approximately 1.15 billion people are at risk, and thousands suffer from 
permanent neurological disorders across Asian countries, with 10-15 thousand 
people dying each year. JEV crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and forms a 
complex with receptors on the surface of neurons. GRP78, Src, TLR7, caveolin-1, 
and dopamine receptor D2 are involved in JEV binding and entry into the neurons, 
and these receptors also play a role in carcinogenic activity in cells. JEV 
binds to GRP78, a member of the HSP70 overexpressed on malignant cells to enter 
neurons, indicating a higher chance of JEV infection in cancer patients. 
However, JEV enters human brain microvascular endothelial cells via an endocytic 
pathway mediated by caveolae and the ezrin protein and also targets 
dopamine-rich areas for infection of the midbrain via altering dopamine levels. 
In addition, JEV complexed with CLEC5A receptor of macrophage cells is involved 
in the breakdown of the BBB and central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. 
CLEC5A-mediated infection is also responsible for the influx of cytokines into 
the CNS. In this review, we discuss the neuronal and macrophage surface 
receptors involved in neuronal death."
1200,"Canine ocular papillomas occur on the haired skin of eyelids, conjunctival 
epithelium, and rarely on the cornea. Using PCR typing assays with canine 
papillomavirus type-specific primer sets, our study confirmed that the 
papillomas contained canine papillomavirus type 1. The positive result from a 
rolling circle amplification assay indicated the CPV1 viral genome in the cells 
is a circular episomal form. We also successfully established the first canine 
corneal cell line using the conditional reprogramming method. The cells 
exhibited an epithelial cell morphology, grew rapidly in vitro, and could be 
maintained long term. For the continued growth of the canine corneal cells, 
feeder cells played a more important role than Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632. 
More importantly, the viral CPV1 genome was maintained in the canine corneal 
cells during the long-term expansion. Unlimited supplies of these cells provide 
as a model for the study CPV in dog cells, and a platform for drug screening for 
effective therapies against canine papillomavirus infection in the future."
1201,"The cervical microbiota is essential in female sexual health, and its altered 
states seem to have a central role in the dynamic of high-risk papillomavirus 
(hrHPV) infections. This study aimed to evaluate the variation in bacterial 
communities' compositions according to hrHPV. We collected two samples per 
woman, with a difference of 12 ± 1 months between them, and performed a 
follow-up on 66 of these women. The viral load (VL) of the hrHPV was estimated 
by quantitative PCR (qPCR), then it was normalized (using the HMBS gene as 
reference) and transformed to the Log10 scale to facilitate the interpretation. 
The VL was categorized as Negative, without hrHPV copies; Low, less than 100 
hrHPV copies; Medium, between 100 to 102 hrHPV copies; and High, &gt;102 hrHPV 
copies. The microbiota composition was described through the Illumina Novaseq 
PE250 platform. The diversity analyses revealed changes regarding the hrHPV VL, 
where women with low VL (&lt;100 hrHPV copies) presented high diversity. The 
community state type (CST) IV was the most common. However, in women with high 
VL, a lower association with Lactobacillus depletion was found. Lactobacillus 
gallinarum and L. iners were the most abundant species in women with high VL, 
whereas women with low VL had a 6.06 greater probability of exhibiting 
Lactobacillus dominance. We identified conspicuous differences in the abundance 
of 78 bacterial genera between women with low and high VL, where 26 were 
depleted (e.g., Gardnerella) and 52 increased (e.g., Mycoplasma). A multilevel 
mixed-effects linear regression showed changes in the diversity due to the 
interaction between the measurement time and the VL, with a decrease in 
diversity in the second follow-up in women with low VL (Coeff. = 0.47), whereas 
the women with medium VL displayed an increase in diversity (Coeff. = 0.58). 
Here, we report for the first time that the cervical microbiota is influenced by 
the number of copies of hrHPV, where a decrease in the abundance of 
Lactobacillus, greater diversity, and enrichment of bacterial taxa is relevant 
in women with low VL."
1202,"Hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) is a predictor of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Studies on anti-viral 
therapy have shown that the use of NUC therapy in HBV patients could reduce the 
incidence of HCC. However, the incidence of HCC continues to increase after 
long-term anti-viral therapy. The relationship between HBcrAg and HCC 
development in CHB-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients undergoing long-term 
anti-viral therapy is still unclear. This study enrolled 1108 treatment-naïve 
CHB patients diagnosed with HBV-related LC receiving NUC therapy from April 1999 
to February 2015. The baseline biomarkers, disease history, and following 
results were collected by the hospital. Among the 1108 patients, 219 developed 
HCC within a median follow-up period of 6.85 years. A multivariable Cox 
regression model was used, with adjustment for age, gender, FIB-4, DM, and 
HBsAg-HQ. The adjusted hazard ratios for the HBcrAg tertile levels were 1.70 
(95%CI: 1.21, 2.39) and 2.14 (95%CI: 1.50, 3.05) for levels 3.4-4.9 and &gt;4.9 
logU/mL, respectively, compared with levels ≤3.4. The effect of the HBcrAg level 
on HCC incidence was found to be significantly modified by HBsAg-HQ, where lower 
HBsAg-HQ (≤ 3) values were associated with a significantly higher risk, but 
HBsAg-HQ levels &gt;3 were not. Our results highlight that, after adjustment for 
potential confounding factors, patients with CHB-related LC and higher HBcrAg 
levels are at significant risk for HCC development, even while undergoing 
long-term effective anti-viral therapy. The HBcrAg level is therefore an 
independent risk factor for HCC development, especially for patients with 
HBsAg-HQ levels &lt;3."
1203,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss is associated with improved 
clinical outcomes for individuals with chronic hepatitis B (CHB); however, the 
effects of varying HBsAg levels on clinical outcomes in diverse cohorts are 
understudied.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional, multicentre, retrospective study, the data on 
adult subjects enrolled in the Canadian HBV Network with CHB seen from 1 January 
2012 to 30 January 2021 with the treatment and virologic data within 1 year of 
HBsAg testing were analyzed. Patients were tested for HBsAg using qualitative 
(for HBsAg-negative samples) and/or commercial quantitative assays. Fibrosis or 
hepatic necroinflammation was determined by the liver stiffness measurement 
(LSM). The baseline data were summarized using descriptive statistics and 
compared by using univariable/multivariable analyses.
RESULTS: This study included 844 CHB patients, with a median age of 49.6 years 
(IQR 40.1-60.5), and 37% were female. In total, 751 patients (78.6%) had known 
ethnicity data, and 76.7% self-reported as Asian, 11.4% as Black, 6.8% as White, 
and 4.8% as other. Among the 844 patients, 237 (28.0%) were HBsAg (-) 
(&lt;LLOQ), 190 (22.5%) had qHBsAg 1-100, 91 (10.8%) had qHBsAg 100-500, 54 
(6.4%) had qHBsAg 500-1000, and 272 (32.2%) had qHBsAg &gt;1000 IU/mL. Overall, 
80% (682) had known HBeAg status at the last follow-up, and the majority (87.0%) 
were HBeAg-negative. In addition, 54% (461/844) had prior antiviral therapy, 
19.7% of which (16.3, 23.7, n = 91) were HBsAg (-). The treated patients had a 
lower risk of cirrhosis (16.46, 95% CI 1.89-143.39, p = 0.01) or HCC (8.23, 95% 
CI 1.01-67.39, p = 0.05) than the untreated patients. A lower proportion of the 
HBsAg-loss group had cirrhosis (5.7% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.021) and HCC (0.9% vs. 
6.2%, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: In this retrospective, ethnically diverse cohort study, CHB patients 
who received antiviral therapy and/or had HBsAg loss were less likely to develop 
cirrhosis and HCC, confirming the results of the studies in less diverse 
cohorts. No association was found between the qHBsAg level and fibrosis 
determined with LSM. Individuals who achieved HBsAg loss had low-level qHBsAg 
within 1 year of seroclearance."
1204,"Background: The persistence of antibody levels after COVID-19 vaccination has 
public health relevance. We analyzed the determinants of quantitative serology 
at 9 months after vaccination in a multicenter cohort. Methods: We analyzed data 
on anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody levels at 9 months from the first dose of 
vaccinated HCW from eight centers in Italy, Germany, Spain, Romania and 
Slovakia. Serological levels were log-transformed to account for the skewness of 
the distribution and normalized by dividing them by center-specific standard 
errors. We fitted center-specific multivariate regression models to estimate the 
cohort-specific relative risks (RR) of an increase of one standard deviation of 
log antibody level and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and 
combined them in random-effects meta-analyses. Finally, we conducted a trend 
analysis of 1 to 7 months' serology within one cohort. Results: We included 
20,216 HCW with up to two vaccine doses and showed that high antibody levels 
were associated with female sex (p = 0.01), age (RR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.86-0.88 
per 10-year increase), 10-day increase in time since last vaccine (RR = 0.97, 
95% CI 0.97-0.98), previous infection (3.03, 95% CI = 2.92-3.13), two vaccine 
doses (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.09-1.36), use of Spikevax (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 
1.39-1.64), Vaxzevria (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.44-0.73) or heterologous 
vaccination (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.12-1.57), compared to Comirnaty. The trend in 
the Bologna cohort, based on 3979 measurements, showed a decrease in mean 
standardized antibody level from 8.17 to 7.06 (1-7 months, p for trend 0.005). 
Conclusions: Our findings corroborate current knowledge on the determinants of 
COVID-19 vaccine-induced immunity and declining trend with time."
1205,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity 
worldwide, since chronic HBV infection is associated with elevated risk of 
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current licensed therapies against HBV 
efficiently suppress viral replication; however, they do not have significant 
effects on the intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) of the viral 
minichromosome responsible for viral persistence. Thus, life-long treatment is 
required to avoid viral rebound. There is a significant need for novel therapies 
that can reduce, silence or eradicate cccDNA, thus preventing HBV reemergence 
after treatment withdrawal. In this review, we discuss the latest developments 
and applications of gene editing and related approaches for directly targeting 
HBV DNA and, more specifically, cccDNA in infected hepatocytes."
1206,"The APOBEC3 (A3) proteins are cytidine deaminases that exhibit the ability to 
insert mutations in DNA and/or RNA sequences. APOBEC3B (A3B) has been evidenced 
as a DNA mutagen with consistent high expression in several cancer types. Data 
concerning the A3B influence on HPV infection and cervical cancer are limited 
and controversial. We investigated the role of A3B expression levels in cervical 
cancer in affected women positive for infection by different HPV types. Tumor 
biopsies from cancerous uterine cervix were collected from 216 women registered 
at Hospital do Câncer II of Instituto Nacional de Câncer, and infecting HPV was 
typed. A3B expression levels were quantified from RNA samples extracted from 
cervical biopsies using real-time quantitative PCR. Median A3B expression levels 
were higher among HPV18+ samples when compared to HPV16+ counterparts and were 
also increased compared to samples positive for other HPV types. In squamous 
cell carcinoma, HPV18+ samples also showed increased median A3B expression when 
compared to HPV Alpha-9 species or only to HPV16+ samples. Our findings suggest 
that A3B expression is differentially upregulated in cervical cancer samples 
infected with HPV18. A3B could be potentially used as a biomarker for HPV 
infection and as a prognostic tool for clinical outcomes in the context of 
cervical cancer."
1207,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious 
hazard for hemodialysis (HD) patients and kidney transplant (KTX) recipients as 
they suffer from an impaired immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In 
addition, a definition of SARS-CoV-2 IgG titer that indicates a sufficient 
immune response, especially against new omicron variants, is urgently needed. In 
the present study, the immune response to either a third or a fourth dose of a 
mRNA vaccine was investigated in 309 dialysis and 36 KTX patients. SARS-CoV-2 
IgG titer thresholds indicating neutralizing activity against wild type (WT) and 
the omicron variant BA.1 were quantified. After four vaccine doses, a 
high-neutralizing activity against WT was evidenced in HD patients, whereas the 
neutralizing rate against BA.1 was significant lower. Concerning KTX recipients, 
humoral and cellular immune responses after a third vaccination were still 
highly impaired. This calls for modified omicron-targeting vaccines."
1208,"It has been previously shown that amino acid polymorphisms in reovirus proteins 
μ2 and λ1 are associated with differing levels of interferon induction. In the 
present study, viruses carrying these polymorphisms in either or both proteins, 
were further studied. The two viral determinants exert a synergistic effect on 
the control of β-interferon induction at the protein and mRNA level, with a 
concomitant increase in RIG-I. In contrast, levels of phospho-Stat1 and 
interferon-stimulated genes are increased in singly substituted viruses but with 
no further increase when both substitutions were present. This suggests that the 
viral determinants are acting during initial events of viral recognition. 
Accordingly, difference between viruses was reduced when infection was performed 
with partially uncoated virions (ISVPs) and transfection of RNA recovered from 
early-infected cells recapitulates the differences between viruses harboring the 
different polymorphisms. Altogether, the data are consistent with a redundant or 
complementary role of μ2 and λ1, affecting either early disassembly or the 
nature of the viral RNA in the incoming viral particle. Proteins involved in 
viral RNA synthesis are thus involved in this likely critical aspect of the 
ability of different reovirus variants to infect various cell types, and to 
discriminate between parental and transformed/cancer cells."
1209,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination, 
supported by social and public health measures, has proven efficacious for 
reducing disease severity and virus spread. However, the emergence of highly 
transmissible viral variants that escape prior immunity highlights the need for 
additional mitigation approaches. Heparin binds the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and 
can inhibit virus entry and replication in susceptible human cell lines and 
bronchial epithelial cells. Primary infection predominantly occurs via the nasal 
epithelium, but the nasal cell biology of SARS-CoV-2 is not well studied. We 
hypothesized that prophylactic intranasal administration of heparin may provide 
strain-agnostic protection for household contacts or those in high-risk settings 
against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we investigated the ability of heparin 
to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in differentiated human nasal 
epithelial cells and showed that prolonged exposure to heparin inhibits virus 
infection. Furthermore, we establish a method for PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 
viral genomes in heparin-treated samples that can be adapted for the detection 
of viruses in clinical studies."
1210,"The avian immunosuppressive and neoplastic diseases caused by Marek's disease 
virus (MDV), avian leucosis virus (ALV), and reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) 
are seriously harmful to the global poultry industry. In recent years, 
particularly in 2020-2022, outbreaks of such diseases in chicken flocks 
frequently occurred in China. Herein, we collected live diseased birds from 30 
poultry farms, out of 42 farms with tumour-bearing chicken flocks distributed in 
central China, to investigate the current epidemiology and co-infections of 
these viruses. The results showed that in individual diseased birds, the 
positive infection rates of MDV, ALV, and REV were 69.5% (203/292), 14.4% 
(42/292), and 4.7% (13/277), respectively, while for the flocks, the positive 
infection rates were 96.7% (29/30), 36.7% (11/30), and 20% (6/30), respectively. 
For chicken flocks, monoinfection of MDV, ALV, or REV was 53.3% (16/30), 3.3% 
(1/30), and 0% (0/30), respectively, but a total of 43.3% (13/30) co-infections 
was observed, which includes 23.3% (7/30) of MDV+ALV, 10.0% (3/30) of MDV+REV, 
and 10.0% (3/30) of MDV+ALV+REV co-infections. Interestingly, no ALV+REV 
co-infection or REV monoinfection was observed in the selected poultry farms. 
Our data indicate that the prevalence of virulent MDV strains, partially 
accompanied with ALV and/or REV co-infections, is the main reason for current 
outbreaks of avian neoplastic diseases in central China, providing an important 
reference for the future control of disease."
1211,"An unheard mobilization of resources to find SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapies 
has been sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Two years ago, COVID-19's launch 
propelled mRNA-based technologies into the public eye. Knowledge gained from 
mRNA technology used to combat COVID-19 is assisting in the creation of 
treatments and vaccines to treat existing illnesses and may avert pandemics in 
the future. Exploiting the capacity of mRNA to create therapeutic proteins to 
impede or treat a variety of illnesses, including cancer, is the main goal of 
the quickly developing, highly multidisciplinary field of biomedicine. In this 
review, we explore the potential of mRNA as a vaccine and therapeutic using 
current research findings."
1212,"The main aim of this study is to investigate the current evidence regarding the 
association between COVID-19 vaccination and ocular vascular events. The 
protocol is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022358133). On 18 August 2022, an 
electronic search was conducted through five databases. All original articles 
reporting individuals who were vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines and developed 
ophthalmic vascular events were included. The methodological quality of the 
included studies was assessed using the NIH tool. A total of 49 studies with 130 
ocular vascular cases were included. Venous occlusive events were the most 
common events (54.3%), which mostly occurred following the first dose (46.2%) 
and within the first five days following vaccination (46.2%). Vascular events 
occurred more with the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines (81.6%), and mostly 
presented unilaterally (73.8%). The most frequently reported treatment was 
intravitreal anti-VEGF (n = 39, 30.4%). The majority of patients (90.1%) 
demonstrated either improvement (p = 0.321) or persistence (p = 0.414) in the 
final BCVA. Ophthalmic vascular events are serious vision-threatening side 
effects that have been associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Clinicians should 
be aware of the possible association between COVID-19 vaccines and ocular 
vascular events to provide early diagnosis and treatment."
1213,"Early and effective diagnosis of cancer is decisive for its proper management. 
In this context biomarker-based cancer diagnosis is budding as one of the 
promising ways for early detection, disease progression monitoring, and 
effective cancer therapy. Integration of Biosensing devices with different 
metallic/nonmetallic nanoparticles offers amplification and multiplexing 
capabilities for simultaneous detection of cancer biomarkers (CB's). This study 
provides a comprehensive analysis of the most recent designs and fabrication 
methodologies designed for developing electrochemical biosensors (EB) for early 
detection of cancers. The role of biomarkers in cancer therapeutics is also 
discussed."
1214,"A lack of a universal adult immunization scheme in India poses a challenge to 
achieve universal health coverage. Healthcare disparity is one of the biggest 
challenges in low- and middle-income countries such as India. We aimed to 
estimate the disparities in coverage of various adult vaccines among older 
adults in India using nationally representative data. An observational analysis 
among 31,464 participants aged ≥60 years from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in 
India, 2017-2018, was conducted. Vaccination coverage across wealth quintiles 
and selected non-communicable diseases were reported as frequencies and weighted 
proportions along with their 95% confidence intervals as a measure of 
uncertainty. The highest coverage was of the diphtheria and tetanus vaccine 
(2.75%) followed by typhoid (1.84%), hepatitis B (1.82%), influenza (1.59%), and 
pneumococcal (0.74%). The most affluent groups had a higher coverage of all 
vaccines. Participants having high cholesterol, psychiatric conditions, and 
cancer had the highest coverage of all vaccines. Overall, a very low coverage of 
all vaccines was observed. The coverage was influenced by social determinants of 
health, depicting a disparity in accessing immunization. Hence, at-risk groups 
such as the deprived and multimorbid patients need to be covered under the ambit 
of free immunization to achieve universal health coverage."
1215,"High-grade serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is an immunogenic tumor 
with a unique tumor microenvironment (TME) that extends to the peritoneal 
cavity. The immunosuppressive nature of TME imposes the major challenge to 
develop effective treatment options for HGSOC. Interaction of immune cells in 
TME is an important factor. Hence, a better understanding of immune profile of 
TME may be required for exploring alternative treatment options. Immune 
profiling of peritoneal fluid (PF), tumor specimens, and blood were carried out 
using flowcytometry, ELISA, and Procartaplex immunoassay. The frequency of 
CD56BrightNK cells and expression of functional receptors were reduced in PF. 
Increased activating NKp46+CD56DimNK cells may indicate differential antitumor 
response in PF. Functional receptors on NK, NKT-like and T cells were reduced 
more drastically in tumor specimens. Soluble ligands MIC-B and PVR were reduced, 
whereas B7-H6 was increased in PF. Dissemination of tumor cells contributes to 
soluble ligands in PF. A differential cytokine profile was found in serum and PF 
as IL-2, IL-8, IL-15, IL-27, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF were elevated specifically in PF. 
In conclusion, the differential immune profile and correlation of soluble 
parameters and NK cell receptors with chemo response score may add knowledge to 
understand anti-tumor immune response to develop effective treatment modality."
1216,"Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it was recognized that infection with SARS-CoV-2 
is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer; 
therefore, preventive vaccination in cancer survivors is expected to be 
particularly impactful. Heterogeneity in how a neoplastic disease diagnosis and 
treatment interferes with humoral and cellular immunity, however, poses a number 
of challenges in vaccination strategies. Herein, the available literature on the 
effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines among patients with cancer is critically 
appraised under the lens of anti-neoplastic treatment optimization. The 
objective of this review is to highlight areas of uncertainty, where more 
research could inform future SARS-CoV-2 immunization programs and maximize 
benefits in the high-risk cancer survivor population, and also minimize cancer 
treatment deviations from standard practices."
1217,"Most oropharyngeal and anogenital cancers are caused by human papillomavirus 
(HPV). Although HPV vaccines showed high efficacy against oropharyngeal and 
anogenital HPV infections, and cancer precursors in randomized clinical trials, 
there are limited data on the effectiveness of HPV vaccination against 
HPV-related cancers. We aimed to evaluate the association of HPV vaccination 
with HPV-related cancers among a nationally representative sample of United 
States adults, aged 20-59 years. In a cross-sectional study combining four 
cycles from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, from 2011 
through 2018, we used a survey-weighted logistic regression model, propensity 
score matching and multiple imputations by chained equations to explore the 
association of HPV vaccination with HPV-related cancers. Among 9891 
participants, we did not find an association of HPV vaccination with HPV-related 
cancers (adjusted OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.19; 1.75). Despite no statistically 
significant association between HPV vaccination and HPV-related cancers, our 
study findings suggest that HPV-vaccinated adults might have lower odds of 
developing HPV-related cancers than those who were not vaccinated. Given the 
importance of determining the impact of vaccination on HPV-related cancers, 
there is a need to conduct future research by linking cancer registry data with 
vaccination records, to obtain more robust results."
1218,"The world has been affected socioeconomically for the last two years due to the 
emergence of different variants of the COVID-19 virus. Vaccination is the major 
and most efficient way to prevent the widening of this pandemic. Those who are 
having comorbidities are more vulnerable to serious infections due to their 
immunocompromised state. Additionally, cancer patients could be at significant 
risk for COVID-19. In this pandemic era, the diagnosis and treatment of cancer 
were significantly affected. Clinical trials at the initial stage were performed 
on healthy or COVID-19 infected patients. This produces a greater level of 
hesitancy in cancer patients. This review article provide an update regarding 
the vaccination and treatment for COVID-19 in patients with cancer and future 
directions."
1219,"(a) Background: Omalizumab is an anti-IgE humanized monoclonal antibody marketed 
in China for the conventional treatment of poorly controlled moderate-to-severe 
allergic asthma. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of 
omalizumab, but the data from studies in actual clinical treatment are still 
relatively limited. (b) Methods: Thirty-two patients with moderate-to-severe 
allergic asthma treated with omalizumab on the basis of ICS-LABA (inhaled 
corticosteroids/long-acting beta2-agonist) were selected. Clinical 
characteristics before and after treatment were collected to analyze the 
relationship between changes in serum total IgE levels and peripheral blood EOS 
(eosinophil) levels, FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second), PEF (peak 
expiratory flow), OCS (oral glucocorticoid) dosage, ATC (asthma control test) 
score, and the number of acute exacerbations and the treatment response, in 
order to observe the efficacy of omalizumab in addition to primary therapy, and 
to investigate whether baseline clinical characteristics such as serum total IgE 
and EOS levels could predict a treatment response. (c) Results: Using the ACT 
score as an evaluation, 68.75% of patients benefited from omalizumab treatment 
at the end of 16 weeks. The response group has a reduction in OCS dosage 
(p-values of 0.026 and 0.039), a significant reduction in ACT scores (both p 
&lt; 0.001), and a reduction in the number of acute exacerbations (p = 0.034 and 
0.025, respectively) after omalizumab treatment. The binary logistics analysis 
of factors affecting the effectiveness of omalizumab in the treatment of 
allergic asthma were total serum IgE and the presence of comorbidities (p-values 
of 0.039 and 0.046, respectively). (d) Conclusions: Combining omalizumab with 
ICS-LABA for 16 weeks significantly improves asthma symptoms in Chinese adults 
and can be used as an add-on treatment. In addition, high serum IgE levels and 
the presence of comorbidities were predictors of its therapeutic efficacy."
1220,"Cervical cancer is the most common gynecological malignant tumor worldwide, and 
it remains a major health problem among women, especially in developing 
countries. Despite the significant research efforts employed for tumor 
prevention, cervical cancer ranks as the leading cause of cancer death. Human 
papillomavirus (HPV) is the most important risk factor for cervical cancer. 
Cervical cancer is a preventable disease, for which early detection could 
increase survival rates. Immunotherapies represent a promising approach in the 
treatment of cancer, and several potential candidates are in clinical trials, 
while some are available in the market. However, equal access to available HPV 
vaccines is limited due to their high cost, which remains a global challenge for 
cervical cancer prevention. The implementation of screening programs, disease 
control systems, and medical advancement in developed countries reduce the 
serious complications associated with the disease somewhat; however, the 
incidence and prevalence of cervical cancer in low-income and middle-income 
countries continues to gradually increase, making it the leading cause of 
mortality, largely due to the unaffordable and inaccessible anti-cancer 
therapeutic options. In recent years, plants have been considered as a 
cost-effective production system for the development of vaccines, therapeutics, 
and other biopharmaceuticals. Several proof-of-concept studies showed the 
possibility of producing recombinant biopharmaceuticals for cancer immunotherapy 
in a plant platform. This review summarizes the current knowledge and 
therapeutic options for the prevention of cervical cancer and discusses the 
potential of the plant expression platform to produce affordable HPV vaccines."
1221,"In view of the severe downsides of conventional cancer therapies, the quest of 
developing alternative strategies still remains of critical importance. In this 
regard, antigen cross-presentation, usually employed by dendritic cells (DCs), 
has been recognized as a potential solution to overcome the present impasse in 
anti-cancer therapeutic strategies. It has been established that an elevated 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against cancer cells can be achieved by 
targeting receptors expressed on DCs with specific ligands. Glycans are known to 
serve as ligands for C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) expressed on DCs, and are 
also known to act as a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), and, thus, can be 
harnessed as a potential immunotherapeutic target. In this scenario, integrating 
the knowledge of cross-presentation and glycan-conjugated nanovaccines can help 
us to develop so called 'glyco-nanovaccines' (GNVs) for targeting DCs. Here, we 
briefly review and analyze the potential of GNVs as the next-generation 
anti-tumor immunotherapy. We have compared different antigen-presenting cells 
(APCs) for their ability to cross-present antigens and described the potential 
nanocarriers for tumor antigen cross-presentation. Further, we discuss the role 
of glycans in targeting of DCs, the immune response due to pathogens, and 
imitative approaches, along with parameters, strategies, and challenges involved 
in cross-presentation-based GNVs for cancer immunotherapy. It is known that the 
effectiveness of GNVs in eradicating tumors by inducing strong CTL response in 
the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been largely hindered by tumor 
glycosylation and the expression of different lectin receptors (such as 
galectins) by cancer cells. Tumor glycan signatures can be sensed by a variety 
of lectins expressed on immune cells and mediate the immune suppression which, 
in turn, facilitates immune evasion. Therefore, a sound understanding of the 
glycan language of cancer cells, and glycan-lectin interaction between the 
cancer cells and immune cells, would help in strategically designing the 
next-generation GNVs for anti-tumor immunotherapy."
1222,"HPV vaccine hesitancy is a key barrier to HPV vaccination. Using a 
population-based survey of HCPs practicing in Texas we determined the 
association between formal training of HCPs and perceived self-efficacy in 
counseling HPV vaccine-hesitant parents and adult patients. A total of 1283 HCPs 
completed the survey, with 879 providing vaccination services to pediatric 
patients and 1018 providing vaccination services to adult patients. Among HCPs 
included in this study, 405 of 577 (70%) and 315 of 505 (62%) perceived they 
were very/completely confident in counseling HPV vaccine-hesitant parents and 
adult patients, respectively. Compared to HCPs who received no training, those 
who received formal training in HPV vaccination promotion or counseling had 2.56 
(AOR: 2.56; 95% CI:1.69-3.86) and 2.84 times higher odds (AOR: 2.84; 95% 
CI:1.87-4.33) of perceiving that they were very/completely confident in 
counseling HPV vaccine-hesitant parents and adult patients, respectively. 
Additionally, increasing years of practice and volume of patients seen were 
positively associated with being very/completely confident in counseling HPV 
vaccine-hesitant parents and adult patients. On the other hand, nurses were less 
likely than physicians to be very/completely confident in counseling HPV 
vaccine-hesitant parents. To increase HPV vaccination uptake, HCPs should 
receive tailored training to improve their self-efficacy in addressing HPV 
vaccine-hesitancy."
1223,"OBJECTIVES: The current study aims to survey the willingness of parents to 
vaccinate their children, who are childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
survivors (CALLS), and identify factors associated with vaccine acceptance.
METHODS: Parents of CALLS on/off treatment, with the general condition of being 
amendable to vaccination, were recruited for interviews with attending 
oncologists about COVID-19 vaccination acceptance from July to November 2021 in 
China. After controlling for socioeconomic factors, the Association of 
Oncologists' recommendations and parent-oncologist alliance with acceptance 
status were investigated. For validation, propensity score-matched (PSM) 
analysis was used.
RESULTS: A total of 424 families were included in the study, with CALLS mean 
remission age of 5.99 ± 3.40 years. Among them, 91 (21.4%) agreed, 168 (39.6%) 
hesitated, and 165 (38.9%) parents disagreed with the vaccination. The most 
common reason that kept parents from vaccinating their children was lack of 
recommendations from professional personnel (84/165, 50.9%), and massive amounts 
of internet information (78/175, 44.6%) was the main nonhealthcare resource 
against vaccination. Logistic regression analysis showed that only the 
recommendation from the oncologist was associated with parents' vaccine 
acceptance (OR = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.93-5.20), as demonstrated by PSM comparison 
(42 in recommendation group vs. 18 in nonrecommendation group among 114 pairs, p 
&lt; 0.001). An exploratory analysis revealed that parents with a better 
patient-oncologist alliance had a significantly higher level of acceptance 
(65.6% in alliance group vs. 15.6% in nonalliance group among 32 pairs, p &lt; 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Due to a lack of professional recommendation resources and the 
potential for serious consequences, parents were generally reluctant to 
vaccinate their CALLS. The recommendation of oncologists, which was influenced 
by the parent-oncologist alliance, significantly increased acceptance. This 
study emphasizes the critical role of oncologists in vaccinating cancer 
survivors and can be used to promote COVID-19 vaccines among vulnerable 
populations."
1224,"Cancer is a chronic disease, and it can be lethal due to limited therapeutic 
options. The conventional treatment options for cancer have numerous challenges, 
such as a low blood circulation time as well as poor solubility of anticancer 
drugs. Therapeutic cancer vaccines emerged to try to improve anticancer drugs' 
efficiency and to deliver them to the target site. Cancer vaccines are 
considered a viable therapeutic technique for most solid tumors. Vaccines boost 
antitumor immunity by delivering tumor antigens, nucleic acids, entire cells, 
and peptides. Cancer vaccines are designed to induce long-term antitumor memory, 
causing tumor regression, eradicate minimal residual illness, and prevent 
non-specific or unpleasant effects. These vaccines can assist in the elimination 
of cancer cells from various organs or organ systems in the body, with minimal 
risk of tumor recurrence or metastasis. Vaccines and antigens for anticancer 
therapy are discussed in this review, including current vaccine adjuvants and 
mechanisms of action for various types of vaccines, such as DNA- or mRNA-based 
cancer vaccines. Potential applications of these vaccines focusing on their 
clinical use for better therapeutic efficacy are also discussed along with the 
latest research available in this field."
1225,"Previous studies have indicated that influenza vaccination reduces the 
development of lung cancer. However, the protective effects of influenza 
vaccination on primary liver cancer in patients with chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) are unclear. This cohort study identified 12,985 patients aged at least 55 
years who had received a diagnosis of CKD between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 
2012 from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. The 
patients were classified according to vaccination status. Propensity score 
matching was used to reduce selection bias. Cox proportional hazards regression 
analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between influenza vaccination and 
primary liver cancer in patients with CKD. The prevalence of primary liver 
cancer was lower in patients with CKD who had received an influenza vaccine 
(adjusted hazard ratio: 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35-0.58, p &lt; 
0.001). The protective effects were observed regardless of sex, age, and 
comorbidities. Moreover, dose-dependent protective effects were observed. In the 
subgroup analysis, where the patients were classified by the number of 
vaccinations received, the adjusted hazard ratios for 1, 2-3, and ≥4 
vaccinations were 0.86 (95% CI: 0.63-1.17), 0.45 (95% CI: 0.31-0.63), and 0.21 
(95% CI: 0.14-0.33), respectively. In conclusion, influenza vaccination was 
associated with a lower incidence of liver cancer in patients with CKD."
1226,"We conducted a prospective, randomized two-arm, parallel group, and open label 
trial to investigate whether the use of LINE would increase HPV vaccine 
intention among not completely vaccinated university students. In June 2020, we 
recruited students aged between 18 and 35 years from four universities in Japan. 
Among the 357 enrollees (female, 53%), 178 and 179 participants were randomized 
into the LINE and Mail groups, respectively. At baseline, within three years, 
vaccine intention was observed in 40% vs. 42% of participants, respectively. At 
the first intervention, which provided similar PDF leaflets about HPV vaccine 
and cervical cancer prevention, there was no significant difference in vaccine 
intention between the two groups. However, at the second intervention of 
LINE-assisted knowledge intervention for 5 days per week for 7 weeks, the LINE 
group had a higher proportion of vaccine intention than the no intervention 
group (66% vs. 44%, OR: 2.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.59-4.35) in 
per-protocol analysis. The significance remained in the intention-to-treat 
analysis of multiply imputed datasets. Although LINE did not directly increase 
HPV vaccine intention compared to conventional posts, the LINE-assisted 
provision of information was effective in improving HPV vaccine intention among 
Japanese university and college students."
1227,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is an unprecedented global health emergency. It has been 
highly disruptive for patients with cancer, both due to an increased burden of 
severe illness and due to pressure on healthcare systems. COVID-19 vaccination 
has been an important public health measure for this patient group.
AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the rapid design and startup of a 
multicentre study of COVID-19 vaccine response for vulnerable patients with 
cancer. Study startup: We set up a multicentre prospective observational study 
of COVID-19 vaccination response for Australian patients with cancer. Due to 
intensive collaboration between health services, the funding body and 
laboratories, we were able to develop a protocol and enrol the first patient 
within 52 days of the initial study proposal. Rapid startup was further enabled 
by prompt availability of funding and by high-level engagement of institutional 
review boards, allowing expedited review. Study enrolment: We rapidly enroled 
more than 500 patients, 80% within 4 months of study opening. Engagement and 
follow-up were maintained throughout the course of up to five serial vaccination 
doses.
CONCLUSION: Our study is an example of intensive collaboration inspired by the 
COVID-19 pandemic and may serve as an example of an agile research response to 
real-time public health challenges."
1228,"Ligation of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A by its ligand HLA-E negatively 
regulates the activation of natural killer (NK) cells, as well as subsets of 
CD8+ T cells and innate T cell populations. NKG2A has recently become a novel 
immune checkpoint target for the treatment of cancer and direct antibody 
mediated blockade of NKG2A function is currently under assessment in two phase 3 
clinical trials. In addition to direct targeting, the NKG2A:HLA-E axis can also 
be disrupted indirectly via multiple different targeted cancer agents that were 
not previously recognised to possess immunomodulatory properties. Increased 
understanding of immune cell modulation by targeted cancer therapies will allow 
for the design of rational and more efficacious drug combination strategies to 
improve cancer patient outcomes. In this review, we summarise and discuss the 
various strategies currently in development which either directly or indirectly 
disrupt the NKG2A:HLA-E interaction to enhance NK cell activation against 
cancer."
1229,"INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus infections are the most prevalent sexually 
transmitted disease among women worldwide. Cervical cancer is the second-most 
frequent disease worldwide in terms of incidence and mortality, and it is 
primarily responsible for fatalities in low- to middle-income nations, including 
Ethiopia.
OBJECTIVE: To assess awareness, acceptance, and associated factors of the human 
papillomavirus vaccine among parents of daughters in the Hadiya zone, southern 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: From November to December 2021, a community-based cross-sectional study 
was conducted in the Hadiya zone among parents with daughters in the zone. The 
study respondents were chosen using a two-stage sampling technique from parents 
with a 9-14-year-old daughter. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was 
used to collect data. For analysis, the data were entered into Epidata version 
3.1 and exported to SPSS version 25. Variables with a p-value less than 0.25 in 
the bivariate analysis were transferred to multivariable analysis. A logistic 
regression model was applied to forecast the association between the predictor 
and outcome variables. Statistical significance was considered at a 0.05 
p-value.
RESULTS: The study showed that the overall acceptance of parents to vaccinate 
their daughters with HPV vaccination was 450 (84.9%). Parents of daughters of 
male sex (AOR: 0.407; 95%CI: 0.221, 0.748), who had only one daughter (AOR: 
2.122; 95%CI: 1.221, 3.685), whose daughter(s) attended a government school 
(AOR: 0.476; 95%CI: 0.263, 0.861), who had poor knowledge (AOR: 0.532; 95%CI: 
0.293, 0.969) and who had a negative attitude (AOR: 0.540; 95%CI: 0.299, 0.977) 
were discovered to have a strong correlation.
CONCLUSION: This study found that there was a high level of parental acceptance; 
attitudes and knowledge about the HPV vaccine are significant in determining 
their intentions to vaccinate their daughter. Authorities in high-risk areas for 
cervical cancer incidence should plan and implement strategies by providing 
health information regarding human papillomavirus vaccination with an emphasis 
on raising community awareness."
1230,"Deep learning has substantially improved the state-of-the-art in object 
detection and image classification. Deep learning usually requires large-scale 
labelled datasets to train the models; however, due to the restrictions in 
medical data sharing and accessibility and the expensive labelling cost, the 
application of deep learning in medical image classification has been 
dramatically hindered. In this study, we propose a novel method that leverages 
semi-supervised adversarial learning and pseudo-labelling to incorporate the 
unlabelled images in model learning. We validate the proposed method on two 
public databases, including ChestX-ray14 for lung disease classification and 
BreakHis for breast cancer histopathological image diagnosis. The results show 
that our method achieved highly effective performance with an accuracy of 93.15% 
while using only 30% of the labelled samples, which is comparable to the 
state-of-the-art accuracy for chest X-ray classification; it also outperformed 
the current methods in multi-class breast cancer histopathological image 
classification with a high accuracy of 96.87%."
1231,"Of the various tumour types, colorectal cancer and brain tumours are still 
considered among the most serious and deadly diseases in the world. Therefore, 
many researchers are interested in improving the accuracy and reliability of 
diagnostic medical machine learning models. In computer-aided diagnosis, 
self-supervised learning has been proven to be an effective solution when 
dealing with datasets with insufficient data annotations. However, medical image 
datasets often suffer from data irregularities, making the recognition task even 
more challenging. The class decomposition approach has provided a robust 
solution to such a challenging problem by simplifying the learning of class 
boundaries of a dataset. In this paper, we propose a robust self-supervised 
model, called XDecompo, to improve the transferability of features from the 
pretext task to the downstream task. XDecompo has been designed based on an 
affinity propagation-based class decomposition to effectively encourage learning 
of the class boundaries in the downstream task. XDecompo has an explainable 
component to highlight important pixels that contribute to classification and 
explain the effect of class decomposition on improving the speciality of 
extracted features. We also explore the generalisability of XDecompo in handling 
different medical datasets, such as histopathology for colorectal cancer and 
brain tumour images. The quantitative results demonstrate the robustness of 
XDecompo with high accuracy of 96.16% and 94.30% for CRC and brain tumour 
images, respectively. XDecompo has demonstrated its generalization capability 
and achieved high classification accuracy (both quantitatively and 
qualitatively) in different medical image datasets, compared with other models. 
Moreover, a post hoc explainable method has been used to validate the feature 
transferability, demonstrating highly accurate feature representations."
1232,"Inspired by the observation that pathologists pay more attention to the nuclei 
regions when analyzing pathological images, this study utilized soft 
segmentation to imitate the visual focus mechanism and proposed a new 
segmentation-classification joint model to achieve superior classification 
performance for breast cancer pathology images. Aiming at the characteristics of 
different sizes of nuclei in pathological images, this study developed a new 
segmentation network with excellent cross-scale description ability called 
DIU-Net. To enhance the generalization ability of the segmentation network, that 
is, to avoid the segmentation network from learning low-level features, we 
proposed the Complementary Color Conversion Scheme in the training phase. In 
addition, due to the disparity between the area of the nucleus and the 
background in the pathology image, there is an inherent data imbalance 
phenomenon, dice loss and focal loss were used to overcome this problem. In 
order to further strengthen the classification performance of the model, this 
study adopted a joint training scheme, so that the output of the classification 
network can not only be used to optimize the classification network itself, but 
also optimize the segmentation network. In addition, this model can also provide 
the pathologist model's attention area, increasing the model's interpretability. 
The classification performance verification of the proposed method was carried 
out with the BreaKHis dataset. Our method obtains binary/multi-class 
classification accuracy 97.24/93.75 and 98.19/94.43 for 200× and 400× images, 
outperforming existing methods."
1233,"Among the non-invasive Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening approaches, Computed 
Tomography Colonography (CTC) and Virtual Colonoscopy (VC), are much more 
accurate. This work proposes an AI-based polyp detection framework for virtual 
colonoscopy (VC). Two main steps are addressed in this work: automatic 
segmentation to isolate the colon region from its background, and automatic 
polyp detection. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of the proposed framework 
on low-dose Computed Tomography (CT) scans. We build on our visualization 
approach, Fly-In (FI), which provides ""filet""-like projections of the internal 
surface of the colon. The performance of the Fly-In approach confirms its 
ability with helping gastroenterologists, and it holds a great promise for 
combating CRC. In this work, these 2D projections of FI are fused with the 3D 
colon representation to generate new synthetic images. The synthetic images are 
used to train a RetinaNet model to detect polyps. The trained model has a 94% 
f1-score and 97% sensitivity. Furthermore, we study the effect of dose variation 
in CT scans on the performance of the the FI approach in polyp visualization. A 
simulation platform is developed for CTC visualization using FI, for regular CTC 
and low-dose CTC. This is accomplished using a novel AI restoration algorithm 
that enhances the Low-Dose CT images so that a 3D colon can be successfully 
reconstructed and visualized using the FI approach. Three senior board-certified 
radiologists evaluated the framework for the peak voltages of 30 KV, and the 
average relative sensitivities of the platform were 92%, whereas the 60 KV peak 
voltage produced average relative sensitivities of 99.5%."
1234,"Healthcare systems in recent times have witnessed timely diagnoses with a high 
level of accuracy. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-enabled deep learning (DL) 
models have been used to support medical diagnostics in real time, thus 
resolving the issue of late-stage diagnosis of various diseases and increasing 
performance accuracy. The current approach for the diagnosis of leukemia uses 
traditional procedures, and in most cases, fails in the initial period. Hence, 
several patients suffering from cancer have died prematurely due to the late 
discovery of cancerous cells in blood tissue. Therefore, this study proposes an 
IoMT-enabled convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect malignant and 
benign cancer cells in the patient's blood tissue. In particular, the 
hyper-parameter optimization through radial basis function and dynamic 
coordinate search (HORD) optimization algorithm was used to search for optimal 
values of CNN hyper-parameters. Utilizing the HORD algorithm significantly 
increased the effectiveness of finding the best solution for the CNN model by 
searching multidimensional hyper-parameters. This implies that the HORD method 
successfully found the values of hyper-parameters for precise leukemia features. 
Additionally, the HORD method increased the performance of the model by 
optimizing and searching for the best set of hyper-parameters for the CNN model. 
Leukemia datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model 
using standard performance indicators. The proposed model revealed significant 
classification accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art models."
1235,"Artificial intelligence plays an essential role in diagnosing lung cancer. Lung 
cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose until it has progressed to a late 
stage, making it a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Lung cancer is 
fatal if not treated early, making this a significant issue. Initial diagnosis 
of malignant nodules is often made using chest radiography (X-ray) and computed 
tomography (CT) scans; nevertheless, the possibility of benign nodules leads to 
wrong choices. In their first phases, benign and malignant nodules seem very 
similar. Additionally, radiologists have a hard time viewing and categorizing 
lung abnormalities. Lung cancer screenings performed by radiologists are often 
performed with the use of computer-aided diagnostic technologies. Computer 
scientists have presented many methods for identifying lung cancer in recent 
years. Low-quality images compromise the segmentation process, rendering 
traditional lung cancer prediction algorithms inaccurate. This article suggests 
a highly effective strategy for identifying and categorizing lung cancer. Noise 
in the pictures was reduced using a weighted filter, and the improved Gray Wolf 
Optimization method was performed before segmentation with watershed 
modification and dilation operations. We used InceptionNet-V3 to classify lung 
cancer into three groups, and it performed well compared to prior studies: 
98.96% accuracy, 94.74% specificity, as well as 100% sensitivity."
1236,"In recent years, Raman spectroscopy has been used to study biological tissues. 
However, the analysis of experimental Raman spectra is still challenging, since 
the Raman spectra of most biological tissue components overlap significantly and 
it is difficult to separate individual components. New methods of analysis are 
needed that would allow for the decomposition of Raman spectra into components 
and the evaluation of their contribution. The aim of our work is to study the 
possibilities of the multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares 
(MCR-ALS) method for the analysis of skin tissues in vivo. We investigated the 
Raman spectra of human skin recorded using a portable conventional Raman 
spectroscopy setup. The MCR-ALS analysis was performed for the Raman spectra of 
normal skin, keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and pigmented 
nevus. We obtained spectral profiles corresponding to the contribution of the 
optical system and skin components: melanin, proteins, lipids, water, etc. The 
obtained results show that the multivariate curve resolution alternating least 
squares analysis can provide new information on the biochemical profiles of skin 
tissues. Such information may be used in medical diagnostics to analyze Raman 
spectra with a low signal-to-noise ratio, as well as in various fields of 
science and industry for preprocessing Raman spectra to remove parasitic 
components."

of curcumin diethyl γ-aminobutyrate (CUR-2GE), a prodrug of curcumin (CUR) 
previously synthesized to overcome unfavorable physicochemical properties of 
CUR. In this study, chitosan (Ch)-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Ch-IONPs) 
were fabricated and optimized using Box-Behnken design-based response surface 
methodology for delivery of CUR-2GE. Ch was used as a coating material on the 
nanoparticle surface to avoid aggregation. The optimized condition for preparing 
Ch-IONPs consisted of using 4 mg Ch fabricated at pH 11 under a reaction 
temperature of 85 °C. The optimized Ch-IONPs were successfully loaded with 
CUR-2GE with sufficient loading capacity (1.72 ± 0.01%) and encapsulation 
efficiency (94.9 ± 0.8%). The obtained CUR-2GE-loaded Ch-IONPs 
(CUR-2GE-Ch-IONPs) exhibited desirable characteristics including a particle size 
of less than 50 nm based on TEM images, superparamagnetic property, highly 
crystalline IONP core, sufficient stability, and sustained-release profile. In 
the presence of permanent magnets, CUR-2GE-Ch-IONPs significantly increased 
cellular uptake and cytotoxicity toward MDA-MB-231 with a 12-fold increase in 
potency compared to free CUR-2GE, indicating the potential of magnetic-field 
assisted delivery of CUR-2GE-Ch-IONPs for the treatment of triple-negative 
breast cancer."
1238,"Lapatinib (Lap) is a lypophilic drug frequently used in cancer treatment; 
however, due to its limited solubility and permeability, achieving therapeutic 
dose through oral administration proves to be a challenge. There are various 
methods for enhancing the solubility of Lap and other similar drugs, one being 
the preparation of amorphous solid dispersions (ASD). In this study, a 
Lap-loaded polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) fiber mat was created with centrifugal 
spinning from a PVP/Lap solution in dimethyl formamide and ethanol. The 
production rate was 12.2 g/h dry fibers, and the fibers had an average thickness 
of 2.55 ± 0.92 μm. In the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram of 
the fiber mat, the melting peak of the crystalline Lap was not visible, 
suggesting that Lap was in an amorphous state. A dissolution study was carried 
out in 0.2 M phosphate buffer saline solution at 37 °C. UV spectrophotometry 
data indicated that in the sample containing the fiber mat, the Lap 
concentration was 332 μg/mL (66%) in 10 min, decreasing to 227 μg/mL by 45 min. 
Meanwhile the crystalline Lap formed a 30-40 μg/mL (6-8%) solution in 5 min, 
maintaining that concentration. We conclude that centrifugal spinning can be an 
effective and easy method to produce ASDs."

and wound treatment. By freeze-drying NFC hydrogel, highly porous NFC structures 
can be manufactured. We freeze-dried NFC hydrogel and subsequently reconstituted 
the samples into a variety of concentrations of NFC fibers, which resulted in 
different stiffness of the material, i.e., different mechanical cues. After the 
successful freeze-drying and reconstitution, we showed that freeze-dried NFC 
hydrogel can be used for one-step 3D cell spheroid culturing of primary 
mesenchymal stem/stromal cells, prostate cancer cells (PC3), and hepatocellular 
carcinoma cells (HepG2). No difference was observed in the viability or 
morphology between the 3D cell spheroids cultured in the freeze-dried and 
reconstituted NFC hydrogel and fresh NFC hydrogel. Furthermore, the 3D cultured 
spheroids showed stable metabolic activity and nearly 100% viability. Finally, 
we applied a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based automatic nuclei 
segmentation approach to automatically segment individual cells of 3D cultured 
PC3 and HepG2 spheroids. These results provide an application to culture 3D cell 
spheroids more readily with the NFC hydrogel and a step towards automatization 
of 3D cell culturing and analysis."
1240,"Polymer colloids have remarkable features and are gaining importance in many 
areas of research including medicinal science. Presently, the innovation of 
cancer drugs is at the top in the world. Polymer colloids have been used as drug 
delivery and diagnosis agents in cancer treatment. The polymer colloids may be 
of different types such as micelles, liposomes, emulsions, cationic carriers, 
and hydrogels. The current article describes the state-of-the-art polymer 
colloids for the treatment of cancer. The contents of this article are about the 
role of polymeric nanomaterials with special emphasis on the different types of 
colloidal materials and their applications in targeted cancer therapy including 
cancer diagnoses. In addition, attempts are made to discuss future perspectives. 
This article will be useful for academics, researchers, and regulatory 
authorities."
1241,"Innovative fibrous materials from cellulose derivative, cellulose acetate (CA) 
and water-soluble polyether, polyethylene glycol (PEG) loaded with natural 
biologically active compounds (BAC), quercetin (QUE) and rutin (RUT), have been 
successfully fabricated by blend electrospinning and dual electrospinning. 
Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the mean fiber diameters of all the 
obtained fibers were in the nanometer range. QUE and RUT incorporated in the 
fibrous mats were in the amorphous state, as evidenced by the performed 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. 
The presence of the polyether in the developed fibrous material assisted the in 
vitro release of the biologically active compounds by improving the 
hydrophilicity and wettability of the mats. Rutin-containing fibrous materials 
manifest the highest antioxidative activity, as determined by the 
2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate free radical method. The cytotoxicity of 
the fabricated novel materials was evaluated using a tumor cell line and normal 
mouse fibroblast cells. The mats containing QUE and QUE/RUT independent of the 
applied spinning method show a higher cytotoxic effect against cancer cells and 
3 to 4.5 times lower cytotoxicity to a noncancer cell line. These features make 
the quercetin- and rutin-containing fibrous materials promising candidates for 
pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and biomedical use."
1242,"Despite its limited exploration, Nymphaea mexicana Zucc. can be beneficial if 
pharmacology, isolation, and biological evaluation are given attention. It is an 
aquatic species that belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae. The thrust area of the 
work was the extraction, isolation, and biological evaluation of different 
extracts of the N. mexicana Zucc. plant. The primary goal of this research was 
to assess the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities of the 
extracts and to isolate the target naringenin compound. Comparative FT IR 
analysis of different extracts of this plant revealed the presence of functional 
groups of plant secondary metabolites, including polyphenols, flavonoids, 
terpenoids, esters, amines, glycosides, alkanes, alkaloids, fatty acids, and 
alcohols. Moderate free radical scavenging potential has been achieved for the 
various extracts via reducing power and DPPH assays. While cytotoxic activity 
was evaluated by colorimetric and lactate dehydrogenase cell viability tests on 
potent cancer cell lines. Lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A-549), and 
breast cells (MC-7) were treated with MeOH extract. The antimicrobial activity 
against bacterial strains was evaluated using Gram-positive and -negative 
cultures, where maximum and minimum inhibition zones were recorded for different 
strains, including 1.6-25.6 μg/mL for Streptococcus aureus, using the agar well 
diffusion method. In addition, the anti-inflammatory activity of different 
extracts of N. mexicana Zucc. was evaluated in a nitrite radical scavenging 
assay with high concentrations of secondary metabolites, which are important 
against human pathogens and other diseases."
1243,"Growing interest has recently been shown in Tepary beans (Phaseolus acutifolius) 
because they contain lectins and protease inhibitors that have been shown to 
have a specific cytotoxic effect on human cancer cells. Bean lectins offer 
protection against biotic and abiotic stress factors, so it is possible that 
mechanical foliar damage may increase lectin production. This study evaluates 
the effect of mechanical stress (foliar damage) on lectin and protease inhibitor 
content in Tepary beans. Seed yield was also analyzed, and phenolic content and 
antioxidant capacity (DPPH and TEAC) were determined in the leaves. An 
experimental design with random blocks of three treatments (T1: control group, 
T2: 50% mechanical foliar damage and T3: 80% mechanical foliar damage) was 
carried out. Mechanical foliar damage increased the amount of lectin binding 
units (LBUs) fivefold (from 1280 to 6542 LBUs in T3) but did not affect units of 
enzymatic activity (UEA) against trypsin (from 60.8 to 51 UEA in T3). Results 
show that controlled mechanical foliar damage could be used to induce 
overexpression of lectins in the seeds of Tepary beans. Mechanical foliar damage 
reduced seed production (-14.6%: from 1890 g to 1615 g in T3) and did not 
significantly increase phenolic compound levels in leaves."
1244,"Leaves of guava (Psidium guajava L.) have been used in Thai folk medicine 
without any supporting evidence as a traditional herbal remedy for hair loss. 
Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is chronic hair loss caused by effects of androgens 
in those with a genetic predisposition, resulting in hair follicle 
miniaturization. Our objectives were to provide the mechanistic assessment of 
guava leaf extract on gene expressions related to the androgen pathway in 
well-known in vitro models, hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPC), and 
human prostate cancer cells (DU-145), and to determine its bioactive 
constituents and antioxidant activities. LC-MS analysis demonstrated that the 
main components of the ethanolic extract of guava leaves are phenolic 
substances, specifically catechin, gallic acid, and quercetin, which contribute 
to its scavenging and metal chelating abilities. The guava leaf extract 
substantially downregulated SRD5A1, SRD5A2, and SRD5A3 genes in the DU-145 
model, suggesting that the extract could minimize hair loss by inhibiting the 
synthesis of a potent androgen (dihydrotestosterone). SRD5A suppression by 
gallic acid and quercetin was verified. Our study reveals new perspectives on 
guava leaf extract's anti-androgen properties. This extract could be developed 
as alternative products or therapeutic adjuvants for the treatment of AGA and 
other androgen-related disorders."
1245,"Myelosuppression is a major adverse effect of chemotherapy. With the increasing 
number of cancer patients worldwide, there is a growing interest in therapeutic 
approaches that reduce the adverse effects of chemotherapy. Angelica gigas Nakai 
(AGN) roots have been widely used in oriental medicine to treat blood-related 
diseases, including cancer. However, the effects of AGN on myelosuppression have 
not been studied. Here, we investigated the effects of AGN ethanol extract 
(AGNEX) on cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression. AGNEX treatment 
significantly decreased white blood cell levels while increasing red blood cell 
and platelet levels in the peripheral blood. It inhibited thymus and spleen 
atrophy. It also enhanced serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF)-α. qRT-PCR results showed that AGNEX decreased the expression of 
IL-1b and stem cell factor (SCF) in the bone marrow (BM) while increasing the 
mRNA expression of IL-3 and IL-6 in the spleen. Although AGNEX did not 
significantly decrease apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the BM and 
splenocytes, AGNEX plays a positive role in cyclophosphamide-induced 
myelosuppression. AGNEX administration increased BM cells in the femur while 
decreasing apoptotic BM cells. These findings suggest that AGNEX could be used 
to treat myelosuppression and as a combination therapy in cancer patients."
1246,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the chemical composition of Tanacetum 
balsamita L. essential oils (EOs) obtained from different plant organs, flowers 
(FEO), leaves (LEO), and stems (SEO), as well as to assess their biological 
properties. The results obtained by using GC and GC/MS analysis indicate that 
this plant belongs to the carvone chemotype. Moreover, we examined the oil's 
antimicrobial and antitumor potential. Antimicrobial effects were determined 
using minimum inhibitory concentrations assay and the vapor phase method. 
Obtained results indicate better antimicrobial activity of investigated EO 
samples compared to the commercially available antibiotics. On the treatment 
with FEO, Y. enterocolitica and H. influenzae showed high sensitivity, while 
treatment with LEO and SEO showed the highest effects against S. aureus. The 
vapor phase method, as an in situ antibacterial analysis, was performed using 
LEO. Obtained results showed that this EO has significant activity toward S. 
pneumoniae in the apple and carrot models, L. monocytogenes in the pear model, 
and Y. enterocolitica in the white radish model. The potential antitumor 
mechanisms of FEO, LEO, and SEO were determined by the means of cell viability, 
redox potential, and migratory capacity in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell 
lines. The results show that these EOs exert antiviability potential in a time- 
and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, treatments with these EOs decreased the 
levels of superoxide anion radical and increased the levels of nitric oxide in 
both tested cell lines. The results regarding total and reduced glutathione 
revealed, overall, an increase in the levels of total glutathione and a decrease 
in the levels of reduced glutathione, indicating strong antioxidative potential 
in tested cancer cells in response to the prooxidative effects of the tested 
EOs. The tested EOs also exerted a drop in migratory capacity, which indicates 
that they can be potentially used as chemotherapeutic agents."
1247,"Major threats to the human lifespan include cancer, infectious diseases, 
diabetes, mental degenerative conditions and also reduced agricultural 
productivity due to climate changes, together with new and more devastating 
plant diseases. From all of this, the need arises to find new biopesticides and 
new medicines. Plants and microorganisms are the most important sources for 
isolating new metabolites. Lampedusa Island host a rich contingent of endemic 
species and subspecies. Seven plant species spontaneously growing in Lampedusa, 
i.e., Atriplex halimus L. (Ap), Daucus lopadusanus Tineo (Dl), Echinops spinosus 
Fiori (Es) Glaucium flavum Crantz (Gf) Hypericum aegypticum L: (Ha), Periploca 
angustifolia Labill (Pa), and Prasium majus L. (Pm) were collected, assessed for 
their metabolite content, and evaluated for potential applications in 
agriculture and medicine. The HPLC-MS analysis of n-hexane (HE) and CH2Cl2 (MC) 
extracts and the residual aqueous phases (WR) showed the presence of several 
metabolites in both organic extracts. Crude HE and MC extracts from Dl and He 
significantly inhibited butyrylcholinesterase, as did WR from the extraction of 
Dl and Pa. HE and MC extracts showed a significant toxicity towards 
hepatocarcinoma Huh7, while Dl, Ha and Er HE extracts were the most potently 
cytotoxic to ileocecal colorectal adenocarcinoma HCT-8 cell lines. Most extracts 
showed antiviral activity. At the lowest concentration tested (1.56 μg/mL), Dl, 
Gf and Ap MC extracts inhibited betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection by&gt; 2 
fold, while the n-hexane extract of Pm was the most potent. In addition, at 1.56 
μg/mL, potent inhibition (&gt;10 fold) of dengue virus was detected for 
Dl,&amp;nbsp;Er, and Pm HE extracts, while Pa and Ap MC extracts dampened 
infections to undetectable levels. Regarding to phytotoxicity, MC extracts from 
Er, Ap and Pm were more effective in inhibiting tomato rootlet elongation; the 
same first two extracts also inhibited seed cress germination while its radicle 
elongation, due to high sensitivity, was affected by all the extracts. Es and Gf 
MC extracts also inhibited seed germination of Phelipanche ramosa. Thus, we have 
uncovered that many of these Lampedusa plants displayed promising biopesticide, 
antiviral, and biological properties."
1248,"The kingdom of Saudi Arabia (SA) ranks fifth in Asia in terms of area. It 
features broad biodiversity, including interesting flora, and was the historical 
origin of Islam. It is endowed with a large variety of plants, including many 
herbs, shrubs, and trees. Many of these plants have a long history of use in 
traditional medicine. The aim of this review is to evaluate the present 
knowledge on the plants growing in SA regarding their pharmacological and 
biological activities and the identification of their bioactive compounds to 
determine which plants could be of interest for further studies. A systematic 
summary of the plants' history, distribution, various pharmacological 
activities, bioactive compounds, and clinical trials are presented in this paper 
to facilitate future exploration of their therapeutic potential. The literature 
was obtained from several scientific search engines, including Sci-Finder, 
PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, MDPI, Wiley publications, and 
Springer Link. Plant names and their synonyms were validated by 'The Plant List' 
on 1 October 2021. SA is home to approximately 2247 plant species, including 
native and introduced plants that belong to 142 families and 837 genera. It 
shares the flora of three continents, with many unique features due to its 
extreme climate and geographical and geological conditions. As plants remain the 
leading supplier of new therapeutic agents to treat various ailments, Saudi 
Arabian plants may play a significant role in the fight against cancer, 
inflammation, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. To date, 102 active compounds 
have been identified in plants from different sites in SA. Plants from the 
western and southwestern regions have been evaluated for various biological 
activities, including antioxidant, anti-cancer, antimicrobial, antimalarial, 
anti-inflammatory, anti-glycation, and cytotoxic activities. The aerial parts of 
the plants, especially the leaves, have yielded most of the bioactive compounds. 
Most bioactivity tests involve in vitro assessments for the inhibition of the 
growth of tumour cell lines, and several compounds with in vitro antitumour 
activity have been reported. More in-depth studies to evaluate the mode of 
action of the compounds are necessary to pave the way for clinical trials. 
Ecological and taxonomical studies are needed to evaluate the flora of SA, and a 
plan for the conservation of wild plants should be implemented, including the 
management of the protection of endemic plants."
1249,"The medicinal potential of hop (Humulus lupulus L.) is widely cited in ancient 
literature and is also allowed in several official pharmacopoeias for the 
treatment of a variety of ailments, mainly related to anxiety states. This is 
due to the plethora of phytoconstituents (e.g., bitter acids, polyphenols, 
prenyl flavonoids) present in the female inflorescences, commonly known as cones 
or strobili, endowed with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and 
phytoestrogen activities. Hop has recently attracted the interest of the 
scientific community due to the presence of xanthohumol, whose strong 
anti-cancer activity against various types of cancer cells has been well 
documented, and for the presence of 8-prenyl naringenin, the most potent known 
phytoestrogen. Studies in the literature have also shown that hop compounds can 
hinder numerous signalling pathways, including ERK1/2 phosphorylation, 
regulation of AP-1 activity, PI3K-Akt, and nuclear factor NF-κB, which are the 
main targets of the antiproliferative action of bitter acids and 
prenylflavonoids. In light of these considerations, the aim of this review was 
to provide an up-to-date overview of the main biologically active compounds 
found in hops, as well as their in vitro and in vivo applications for human 
health and disease prevention. To this end, a quantitative literature analysis 
approach was used, using VOSviewer software to extract and process Scopus 
bibliometric data. In addition, data on the pharmacokinetics of bioactive hop 
compounds and clinical studies in the literature were analysed. To make the 
information more complete, studies on the beneficial properties of the other two 
species belonging to the genus Humulus, H. japonicus and H. yunnanensis, were 
also reviewed for the first time."
1250,"A typical feature of living tissues is proliferation by division: it is a 
fundamental aspect of many biological processes, including embryonic 
development, morphogenesis, and cancer growth. Here, we study the energetics of 
cell division occurring in epithelia, highlighting the interplay of the key 
parameters ruling mitosis. We find the existence of a region, in the parameter 
space, which is independent of the cell elasticity and weakly dependent on the 
ratio between mother and daughter cells areas. In this region, cell division is 
energetically favorable. Our results may lead to an exact characterization of 
cells having anomalous proliferation."
1251,"Chitosan-decorated liposomes were proposed for the first time for the intranasal 
delivery of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reactivator pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM) 
to the brain as a therapy for organophosphorus compounds (OPs) poisoning. 
Firstly, the chitosome composition based on phospholipids, cholesterol, 
chitosans (Cs) of different molecular weights, and its arginine derivative was 
developed and optimized. The use of the polymer modification led to an increase 
in the encapsulation efficiency toward rhodamine B (RhB; ~85%) and 2-PAM (~60%) 
by 20% compared to conventional liposomes. The formation of monodispersed and 
stable nanosized particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of up to 130 nm was 
shown using dynamic light scattering. The addition of the polymers recharged the 
liposome surface (from -15 mV to +20 mV), which demonstrates the successful 
deposition of Cs on the vesicles. In vitro spectrophotometric analysis showed a 
slow release of substrates (RhB and 2-PAM) from the nanocontainers, while the 
concentration and Cs type did not significantly affect the chitosome 
permeability. Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy qualitatively and 
quantitatively demonstrated the penetration of the developed chitosomes into 
normal Chang liver and M-HeLa cervical cancer cells. At the final stage, the 
ability of the formulated 2-PAM to reactivate brain AChE was assessed in a model 
of paraoxon-induced poisoning in an in vivo test. Intranasal administration of 
2-PAM-containing chitosomes allows it to reach the degree of enzyme reactivation 
up to 35 ± 4%."
1252,"Prophylaxis and the treatment of surgical site infections (SSIs) with 
antibiotics frequently fail due to the antibiotic resistance of bacteria and the 
ability of bacteria to reside in biofilms (i.e., bacterial clusters in a 
protective matrix). Therefore, alternative antibacterial treatments are required 
to combat biofilm infections. The combination of diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC-) 
and copper ions (Cu2+) exhibited antibiofilm activity against the staphylococci 
species associated with SSIs; however, the formation of a water-insoluble 
Cu(DDC)2 complex limits its application to SSIs. Here, we describe the 
development and antibiofilm activity of an injectable gel containing a liposomal 
formulation of Cu(DDC)2 and Cu2+ (lipogel). Lyophilized liposomes were 
incorporated into a mixture of chitosan (CS) and beta-glycerophosphate (βGP), 
and the thermosensitive gelling properties of CS-βGP and the lipogel were 
determined. The liposomes remained stable after lyophilization over six months 
at 4-6 °C and -20 °C. The sol-gel transition of the gel and lipogel occurred 
between 33 and 39 °C, independently of sterilization or storage at -20 °C. 
CS-βGP is biocompatible and the liposomes were released over time. The lipogel 
prevented biofilm formation over 2 days and killed 98.7% of the 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 99.9% of the Staphylococcus 
epidermidis biofilms. Therefore, the lipogel is a promising new prophylaxis and 
treatment strategy for local application to SSIs."
1253,"Two chemical motifs of interest for medicinal chemistry, silatrane as 
1-(3-aminopropyl) silatrane (SIL M), and nitro group attached in position 5 to 
salicylaldehyde, are coupled in a new structure, 
1-(3-{[(2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)methylidene]amino}propyl)silatrane (SIL-BS), 
through an azomethine moiety, also known as a versatile pharmacophore. The high 
purity isolated compound was structurally characterized by an elemental, 
spectral, and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Given the structural 
premises for being a biologically active compound, different specific techniques 
and protocols have been used to evaluate their in vitro hydrolytic stability in 
simulated physiological conditions, the cytotoxicity on two cancer cell lines 
(HepG2 and MCF7), and protein binding ability-with a major role in drug ADME 
(Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion), in parallel with those of 
the SIL M. While the latter had a good biocompatibility, the nitro-silatrane 
derivative, SIL-BS, exhibited a higher cytotoxic activity on HepG2 and MCF7 cell 
lines, performance assigned, among others, to the known capacity of the nitro 
group to promote a specific cytotoxicity by a ""activation by reduction"" 
mechanism. Both compounds exhibited increased bio- and muco-adhesiveness, which 
can favor an optimized therapeutic effect by increased drug permeation and 
residence time in tumor location. Additional benefits of these compounds have 
been demonstrated by their antimicrobial activity on several fungi and bacteria 
species. Molecular docking computations on Human Serum Albumin (HSA) and MPRO 
COVID-19 protease demonstrated their potential in the development of new drugs 
for combined therapy."
1254,"The incorporation of both nitric oxide (NO) donor (S-nitrosoglutathione, GSNO) 
and silica nanoparticles loaded with cisplatin (SiO2@CisPt NPs) into a polymeric 
matrix represents a suitable approach to creating a drug-delivery system with 
sustained and localized drug release against tumor cells. Herein, we report the 
synthesis, characterization, and cytotoxicity evaluation of Pluronic 
F-127/hyaluronic acid hydrogel containing GSNO and SiO2@CisPt NPs against breast 
cancer cells. SiO2@CisPt NPs were successfully synthesized, revealing a 
spherical morphology with an average size of 158 ± 20 nm. Both GSNO and 
SiO2@CisPt NPs were incorporated into the thermoresponsive Pluronic/hyaluronic 
hydrogel for sustained and localized release of both NO and cisplatin. The 
kinetics of NO release from a hydrogel matrix revealed spontaneous and sustained 
release of NO at the millimolar range for 24 h. The MTT assay showed 
concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of the hydrogel. The combination of GSNO 
and SiO2@CisPt incorporated into a polymeric matrix decreased the cell viability 
20% more than the hydrogel containing only GSNO or SiO2@CisPt. At 200 µg/mL, 
this combination led to a critical cell viability of 30%, indicating a 
synergistic effect between GSNO and SiO2@CisPt NPs in the hydrogel matrix, and, 
therefore, highlighting the potential application of this drug-delivery system 
in the field of biomedicine."
1255,"Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in males. In the case of 
locally advanced prostate cancer radical prostatectomy is one of the first-line 
therapy. However, recurrence after resection of the tumor can appear. 
Drug-eluting bioresorbable implants acting locally in the area of the tumor or 
the resection margins, that reduce the risk of recurrence would be advantageous. 
Electrospinning offers many benefits in terms of local delivery so fiber-forming 
polyesters and polyestercarbonates which are suitable to be drug-loaded were 
used in the study to obtain CTX or DTX-loaded electrospun patches for local 
delivery. After a fast verification step, patches based on the blend of 
poly(glycolide-ε-caprolactone) and poly(lactide-glycolide) as well as patches 
obtained with poly(lactide-glycolide- ε-caprolactone) were chosen for long-term 
study. After three months, 60% of the drug was released from (PGCL/PLGA) + CTX 
and it was selected for final, anticancer activity analysis with the use of PC-3 
and DU145 cells to establish its therapeutic potential. CTX-loaded patches 
reduced cell growth to 53% and 31% respectively, as compared to drug-free 
patches. Extracts from drug-free patches showed excellent biocompatibility with 
the PC-3 cell line. Cabazitaxel-loaded bioresorbable patches are a promising 
drug delivery system for prostate cancer therapy."
1256,"Over 75 kinase inhibitors (KIs) have been approved for the treatment of various 
cancers. KIs are orally administrated but mostly lack pediatric age-appropriate 
dosage forms or instructions for dose manipulation. This is highly problematic 
for clinical practice in pediatric oncology, as flexible oral formulations are 
essential to individually set dosages and to adjust it to a child's 
swallowability. Most KIs are poorly soluble, categorized in Biopharmaceutics 
Classification System (BCS) class II or IV, and improperly manipulating the KI 
formulation can alter pharmacokinetics and jeopardize KI drug safety and 
efficacy. Therefore, the goals of this review were to provide practical 
recommendations for manipulating the formulation of the 15 most frequently used 
KIs in pediatric oncology (i.e., bosutinib, cabozantinib, cobimetinib, 
crizotinib, dabrafenib, dasatinib, entrectinib, imatinib, larotrectinib, 
nilotinib, ponatinib, ruxolitinib, selumetinib, sunitinib and trametinib) based 
on available literature studies and fundamental drug characteristics and to 
establish a decision tool that supports decisions regarding formulation 
manipulation of solid oral dosages of KIs that have been or will be licensed 
(for adult and/or pediatric cancers) but are not included in this review."
1257,"Nanomaterials have been extensively used in several applications in the past few 
decades related to biomedicine and healthcare. Among them, nanogels (NGs) have 
emerged as an important nanoplatform with the properties of both hydrogels and 
nanoparticles for the controlled/sustained delivery of chemo drugs, nucleic 
acids, or other bioactive molecules for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. In 
the recent past, significant research efforts have been invested in synthesizing 
NGs through various synthetic methodologies such as free radical polymerization, 
reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer method (RAFT) and atom transfer 
radical polymerization (ATRP), as well as emulsion techniques. With further 
polymeric functionalizations using activated esters, thiol-ene/yne processes, 
imines/oximes formation, cycloadditions, nucleophilic addition reactions of 
isocyanates, ring-opening, and multicomponent reactions were used to obtain 
functionalized NGs for targeted delivery of drug and other compounds. NGs are 
particularly intriguing for use in the areas of diagnosis, analytics, and 
biomedicine due to their nanodimensionality, material characteristics, 
physiological stability, tunable multi-functionality, and biocompatibility. 
Numerous NGs with a wide range of functionalities and various external/internal 
stimuli-responsive modalities have been possible with novel synthetic reliable 
methodologies. Such continuous development of innovative, intelligent materials 
with novel characteristics is crucial for nanomedicine for next-generation 
biomedical applications. This paper reviews the synthesis and various 
functionalization strategies of NGs with a focus on the recent advances in 
different biomedical applications of these surface modified/functionalized 
single-/dual-/multi-responsive NGs, with various active targeting moieties, in 
the fields of cancer theranostics, immunotherapy, antimicrobial/antiviral, 
antigen presentation for the vaccine, sensing, wound healing, thrombolysis, 
tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine."
1258,"(1) Background: This investigation aimed at developing a series of 
c-Met-targeting cabozantinib-based PROTACs. (2) Methods: Purification of 
intermediate and target compounds was performed using column chromatography, in 
vitro antiproliferation activity was measured using a standard MTT assay and a 
c-Met degradation assay was performed via the immunoblotting technique. (3) 
Results: Several compounds exhibited antiproliferative activity towards 
different cell lines of breast cancer (T47D, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, HCC1954 and 
MCF7) at the same level as parent cabozantinib and 7-demethyl cabozantinib. Two 
target conjugates, bearing a VHL-ligand as an E3-ligase binding moiety and 
glycol-based linkers, exhibited the effective inhibition of c-Met 
phosphorylation and an ability to decrease the level of c-Met in HCC1954 cells 
at micromolar concentrations. (4) Conclusions: Two compounds exhibit c-Met 
inhibition activity in the nanomolar range and can be considered as PROTAC 
molecules due to their ability to decrease the total level of c-Met in HCC1954 
cells. The structures of the offered compounds can be used as starting points 
for further evaluation of cabozantinib-based PROTACs."
1259,"Vincristine (VCR) is responsible for the onset of the VCR-induced peripheral 
neuropathy (VIPN), associated with neuropathic pain. Several reports have 
strongly linked the cholecystokinin type 2 receptor (CCK2R) to nociceptive 
modulation. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the effect of CCK2R blockade on the 
onset of VIPN, as well as its interaction on VCR anticancer efficacy. VCR was 
administrated in mice for 8 days (100 µg/kg/d, i.p.). Transcriptomic analysis of 
the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) was performed at day 7 in VCR and control mice. 
Proglumide (30 mg/kg/d), a CCK1R and CCK2R antagonist, and Ly225910 (1 mg/kg/d), 
a selective CCK2R antagonist, were administrated one day before and during VCR 
treatment. Tactile sensitivity was assessed during treatments. 
Immunofluorescence and morphological analyses were performed on the skin, DRG 
and sciatic nerve at day 7. The cytotoxicity of VCR in combination with 
proglumide/Ly225910 was evaluated in human cancer cell lines. Cck2r was highly 
upregulated in the DRG of VCR mice. Proglumide accelerated the recovery of 
normal sensitivity, while Ly225910 totally prevented the onset of allodynia and 
nerve injuries induced by VCR. Proglumide or Ly225910 in combination with VCR 
did not affect the cytotoxicity of VCR. Targeting CCK2R could therefore be an 
effective strategy to prevent the onset of VIPN."
1260,"Antibodies that recognize cancer biomarkers, such as MUC16, can be used as 
vehicles to deliver contrast agents (imaging) or cytotoxic payloads (therapy) to 
the site of tumors. MUC16 is overexpressed in 80% of epithelial ovarian cancer 
(EOC) and 65% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), where effective 
'theranostic' probes are much needed. This work aims to develop fully human 
antibodies against MUC16 and evaluate them as potential immuno-PET imaging 
probes for detecting ovarian and pancreatic cancers. We developed a fully human 
monoclonal antibody, M16Ab, against MUC16 using phage display. M16Ab was 
conjugated with p-SCN-Bn-DFO and radiolabeled with 89Zr. 89Zr-DFO-M16Ab was then 
evaluated for binding specificity and affinity using flow cytometry. In vivo 
evaluation of 89Zr-DFO-M16Ab was performed by microPET/CT imaging at different 
time points at 24-120 h post injection (p.i.) and ex vivo biodistribution 
studies in mice bearing MUC16-expressing OVCAR3, SKOV3 (ovarian) and SW1990 
(pancreatic) xenografts. 89Zr-DFO-M16Ab bound specifically to MUC16-expressing 
cancer cells with an EC50 of 10nM. 89Zr-DFO-M16Ab was stable in serum and showed 
specific uptake and retention in tumor xenografts even after 120 h p.i. 
(microPET/CT) with tumor-to-blood ratios &gt; 43 for the SW1990 xenograft. 
Specific tumor uptake was observed for SW1990/OVCAR3 xenografts but not in 
MUC16-negative SKOV3 xenografts. Pharmacokinetic study shows a relatively short 
distribution (t1/2α) and elimination half-life (t1/2ß) of 4.4 h and 99 h, 
respectively. In summary, 89Zr-DFO-M16Ab is an effective non-invasive imaging 
probe for ovarian and pancreatic cancers and shows promise for further 
development of theranostic radiopharmaceuticals."
1261,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are particles that are released from cells into the 
extracellular space both under pathological and normal conditions. It is now 
well established that cancer cells secrete more EVs compared to non-cancerous 
cells and that, captivatingly, several proteins that are involved in EV 
biogenesis and secretion are upregulated in various tumours. Recent studies have 
revealed that EVs facilitate the interaction between cancer cells and their 
microenvironment and play a substantial role in the growth of tumours. As EVs 
are involved in several aspects of cancer progression including angiogenesis, 
organotropism, pre-metastatic niche formation, fostering of metastasis, and 
chemoresistance, inhibiting the release of EVs from cancer and the surrounding 
tumour microenvironment cells has been proposed as an ideal strategy to treat 
cancer and associated paraneoplastic syndromes. Lately, EVs have shown immense 
benefits in preclinical settings as a novel drug delivery vehicle. This review 
provides a brief overview of the role of EVs in various hallmarks of cancer, 
focusing on (i) strategies to treat cancer by therapeutically targeting the 
release of tumour-derived EVs and (ii) EVs as valuable drug delivery vehicles. 
Furthermore, we also outline the drawbacks of the existing anti-cancer 
treatments and the future prospective of EV-based therapeutics."
1262,"Among cyclic di-nucleotides (CDN), both cyclic di-AMP (CDA) and di-GMP (CDG) are 
promising adjuvants and immune modulators. These molecules are not only able to 
induce profuse antibody production but also predominant T helper 1 and cytotoxic 
CD8 T lymphocytes (CTL) responses, which enable their use for vaccination 
against intracellular pathogens as well as in cancer immunotherapy. However, for 
their successful translation into the clinic, a comprehensive understanding of 
CDN mode of action is still essential. Consistent with evidence in the 
literature, we show here that IFN-α/β (Type I IFN) is crucial for CDG-mediated B 
cell activation. We recently determined the key role of type I IFN signaling for 
CDA-mediated enhancement of immunogenicity. Based on the biological activities 
of type I IFN, in this study, we hypothesized that it might also be required for 
CTL induction by CDG. We disclose here the mode of action of type I IFN 
signaling in CDG-mediated cross-presentation and subsequent CTL generation."
1263,"The research on flavonoids has exponentially grown since their first therapeutic 
evidence, in 1937. They are effective in vitro in a wide range of human 
diseases, particularly those mediated by free radicals, such as cancer, 
atherosclerosis, AIDS, or neuronal diseases. However, their applications have 
been reduced due to their low solubility, poor absorption, and rapid metabolism. 
Flavonoid encapsulation in nanocarriers significantly improves their oral 
absorption, protects the drug against degradation, decreases the first-pass 
hepatic effect, and makes absorption through the lymphatic system easier. In 
this work, carbon nanotubes were used as nanocarriers of 7-hydroxyflavone, 7-HF. 
The encapsulation of 7-HF into pristine single- and multi-walled carbon 
nanotubes, and into -COOH functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes has been 
investigated. The equilibrium association constants were estimated. The 
structural backbone of 7-HF, two benzene rings linked through three carbon atoms 
that form a pyran heterocyclic ring containing a keto group, seems to play a key 
role in the 7-HF/CNT interactions, although other types of interactions are also 
at work. The in vitro release of 7-HF was studied at three pHs, 2.0, 7.4, and 
9.2, mimicking the different biological barriers of the human organism."
1264,"A family of dinuclear iron (II) compounds with iminopyridine-based ligands 
displays selective cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines. All compounds 
have IC50 values 2-6 fold lower than that of cisplatin, and 30-90 fold lower 
than that of carboplatin for the tumor cell lines assayed. Comparing the IC50 
values between tumor and non-tumor cell lines, the selectivity indexes range 
from 3.2 to 34, compound 10, [Fe2(4)2(CH3CN)4](BF4)4, showing the highest 
selectivity. Those compounds carrying substituents on the iminopyridine ring 
show the same cytotoxicity as those without substituents. However, the 
electronic effects of the substituents on position 6 may be important for the 
cytotoxicity of the complexes, and consequently for their selectivity. All 
compounds act over DNA, promoting cuts on both strands in the presence of 
reactive oxygen species. Since compound 10 presented the highest selectivity, 
its cytotoxic effect was further characterized. It induces apoptosis, affects 
cell cycle phase distribution in a cell-dependent manner, and its cytotoxic 
effect is linked to reactive oxygen species generation. In addition, it 
decreases tumor cell migration, showing potential antimetastatic effects. These 
properties make compound 10 a good lead antitumor agent among all compounds 
studied here."
1265,"Over the past 15 years, glycolipid-type biosurfactant compounds have been 
postulated as novel, naturally synthesized anticancer agents. This study 
utilized a recombinant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to biosynthesize a 
preparation of mono-rhamnolipids that were purified via both liquid and 
solid-phase extraction, characterized by HPLC-MS, and utilized to treat two 
colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT-116 and Caco2) and a healthy colonic 
epithelial cell line CCD-841-CoN. Additionally, the anticancer activity of these 
mono-rhamnolipids was compared to an alternative naturally derived anticancer 
agent, Piceatannol. XTT cell viability assays showed that treatment with 
mono-rhamnolipid significantly reduced the viability of both colorectal cancer 
cell lines whilst having little effect on the healthy colonic epithelial cell 
line. At the concentrations tested mono-rhamnolipids were also shown to be more 
cytotoxic to the colorectal cancer cells than Piceatannol. Staining of 
mono-rhamnolipid-treated cells with propidium iodine and acridine orange 
appeared to show that these compounds induced necrosis in both colorectal cancer 
cell lines. These data provide an early in vitro proof-of-principle for 
utilizing these compounds either as active pharmaceutical ingredient for the 
treatment of colorectal cancer or incorporations into nutraceutical formulations 
to potentially prevent gastrointestinal tract cancer."
1266,"Here, we describe the synthesis of a novel type of rare-earth-doped 
nanoparticles (NPs) for multimodal imaging, by combining the rare-earth elements 
Ce, Gd and Nd in a crystalline host lattice consisting of CaF2 (CaF2: Ce, Gd, 
Nd). CaF2: Ce, Gd, Nd NPs are small (15-20 nm), of uniform shape and size 
distribution, and show good biocompatibility and low immunogenicity in vitro. In 
addition, CaF2: Ce, Gd, Nd NPs possess excellent optical properties. CaF2: Ce, 
Gd, Nd NPs produce downconversion emissions in the second near-infrared window 
(NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) under 808 nm excitation, with a strong emission peak at 
1056 nm. Excitation in the first near- infrared window (NIR-I, 700-900 nm) has 
the advantage of deeper tissue penetration power and reduced autofluorescence, 
compared to visible light. Thus, CaF2: Ce, Gd, Nd NPs are ideally suited for in 
vivo fluorescence imaging. In addition, the presence of Gd3+ makes the NPs 
intrinsically monitorable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Moreover, next to 
fluorescence and MR imaging, our results show that CaF2: Ce, Gd, Nd NPs can be 
used as imaging probes for photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in vitro. Therefore, due 
to their biocompatibility and suitability as multimodal imaging probes, CaF2: 
Ce, Gd, Nd NPs exhibit great potential as a traceable imaging agent in 
biomedical applications."
1267,"Radiation therapy (RT) is frequently used to locally treat tumors. One of the 
major issues in RT is normal tissue toxicity; thus, it is necessary to limit 
dose escalation for enhanced local control in patients that have locally 
advanced tumors. Integrating radiosensitizing agents such as gold nanoparticles 
(GNPs) into RT has been shown to greatly increase the cure rate of solid tumors. 
The objective of this study was to explore the repurposing of an antimalarial 
drug, pyronaridine (PYD), as a DNA repair inhibitor to further enhance 
RT/GNP-induced DNA damage in cancerous cell lines. We were able to achieve 
inhibitory effects of DNA repair due to PYD at 500 nM concentration. Our results 
show a significant enhancement in DNA double-strand breaks of 42% in HeLa cells 
treated with PYD/GNP/RT in comparison to GNP/RT alone when irradiated with a 
dose of 2 Gy. Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in cellular 
proliferation for both HeLa and HCT-116 irradiated cells with the combined 
treatment of PYD/GNP/RT. Therefore, the emergence of promising novel concepts 
introduced in this study could lay the foundation for the transition of this 
treatment modality into clinical environments."
1268,"Exploring the potential of natural extracts for pharmaceutical applications in 
the treatment of different diseases is an emerging field of medical research, 
owing to the tremendous advantages that they can offer. These include compound 
sustainability due to the natural origin and virtually unlimited availability. 
In addition, they contribute to promoting the countries in which they are 
extracted and manufactured. For this reason, wild active compounds derived from 
plants are attracting increasing interest due to their beneficial properties. 
Among them, Avicennia marina has been recently recognized as a potential source 
of natural substances with therapeutic activities for anti-cancer treatment. A. 
marina beneficially supplies different chemical compounds, including cyclic 
triterpenoids, flavonoids, iridoids, naphtaquinones, polyphenols, 
polysaccharides, and steroids, most of them exhibiting potent antitumor 
activity. The in vivo and in vitro studies on different models of solid tumors 
demonstrated its dose-dependent activity. Moreover, the possibility to formulate 
the A. marina extracted molecules in nanoparticles allowed researchers to 
ameliorate the therapeutic outcome of treatments exploiting improved selectivity 
toward cancer cells, thus reducing the side effects due to nonspecific spread."
1269,"Programmed cell death protein 1/Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) 
immune checkpoint inhibitors are the most promising treatments for malignant 
tumors currently, but the low response rate limits their further clinical 
utilization. To address this problem, our group constructed an engineered strain 
of VNP20009-Abvec-Igκ-mPD-1 [V-A-mPD-1 (mPD-1, murine PD-1)] to combine 
oncolytic bacterial therapy with immunotherapy. Further, we evaluated its growth 
performance and mPD-1 expression ability in vitro while establishing the 
melanoma mice model to explore its potential anti-cancer effects in tumor 
therapy. Our results indicated that the V-A-mPD-1 strain has superior growth 
performance and can invade B16F10 melanoma cells and express PD-1. In addition, 
in the melanoma mice model, we observed a marked reduction in tumor volume and 
the formation of a larger necrotic area. V-A-mPD-1 administration resulted in a 
high expression of mPD-1 at the tumor site, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation 
via the down-regulation of the expression of rat sarcoma (Ras), phosphorylated 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-MEK)/MEK, and phosphorylated extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK)/ERK expression significantly inhibited tumor 
cell proliferation. Tumor cell apoptosis was promoted by down-regulating 
phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways, 
as evidenced by an increased Bcl-2-associated X protein/B cell lymphoma-2 
(Bax/Bcl-2) expression ratio. Meanwhile, the expression levels of systemic 
inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), 
and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), were substantially reduced. In conclusion, 
our research demonstrated that V-A-mPD-1 has an excellent anti-tumor effect, 
prompting that the combined application of microbial therapy and immunotherapy 
is a feasible cancer treatment strategy."
1270,"A primary illness that accounts for a significant portion of fatalities 
worldwide is cancer. Among the main malignancies, lung cancer is recognised as 
the most chronic kind of cancer around the globe. Radiation treatment, surgery, 
and chemotherapy are some medical procedures used in the traditional care of 
lung cancer. However, these methods lack selectivity and damage nearby healthy 
cells. Several polysaccharide-based nanomaterials have been created to transport 
chemotherapeutics to reduce harmful and adverse side effects and improve 
response during anti-tumour reactions. To address these drawbacks, a class of 
naturally occurring polymers called polysaccharides have special physical, 
chemical, and biological characteristics. They can interact with the immune 
system to induce a better immunological response. Furthermore, because of the 
flexibility of their structures, it is possible to create multifunctional 
nanocomposites with excellent stability and bioavailability for the delivery of 
medicines to tumour tissues. This study seeks to present new views on the use of 
polysaccharide-based chemotherapeutics and to highlight current developments in 
polysaccharide-based nanomedicines for lung cancer."
1271,"Lung cancer is a common malignancy worldwide, with high morbidity and mortality. 
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an important 
transcription factor that not only regulates different hallmarks of cancer, such 
as tumorigenesis, cell proliferation, and metastasis but also regulates the 
occurrence and maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Abnormal STAT3 activity 
has been found in a variety of cancers, including lung cancer, and its 
phosphorylation level is associated with a poor prognosis of lung cancer. 
Therefore, the STAT3 pathway may represent a promising therapeutic target for 
the treatment of lung cancer. To date, various types of STAT3 inhibitors, 
including natural compounds, small molecules, and gene-based therapies, have 
been developed through direct and indirect strategies, although most of them are 
still in the preclinical or early clinical stages. One of the main obstacles to 
the development of STAT3 inhibitors is the lack of an effective targeted 
delivery system to improve their bioavailability and tumor targetability, 
failing to fully demonstrate their anti-tumor effects. In this review, we will 
summarize the recent advances in STAT3 targeting strategies, as well as the 
applications of nanoparticle-mediated targeted delivery of STAT3 inhibitors in 
the treatment of lung cancer."
1272,"Breast cancer is the most diagnosed type of cancer, with 2.26 million cases and 
685,000 deaths recorded in 2020. If left untreated, this deadly disease can 
metastasize to distant organs, which is the reason behind its incurability and 
related deaths. Currently, conventional therapies are used to treat breast 
cancer, but they have numerous shortcomings such as low bioavailability, short 
circulation time, and off-target toxicity. To address these challenges, 
nanomedicines are preferred and are being extensively investigated for breast 
cancer treatment. Nanomedicines are novel drug delivery systems that can improve 
drug stability, aqueous solubility, blood circulation time, controlled release, 
and targeted delivery at the tumoral site and enhance therapeutic safety and 
effectiveness. Nanoparticles (NPs) can be administered through different routes. 
Although the injectable route is less preferred than the oral route for drug 
administration, it has its advantages: it helps tailor drugs with targeted 
moiety, boosts payload, avoids first-pass metabolism, and improves the 
pharmacokinetic parameters of the active pharmaceutical ingredients. Targeted 
delivery of nanomedicine, closer to organelles such as the mitochondria and 
nuclei in breast cancer, reduces the dosage requirements and the toxic effects 
of chemotherapeutics. This review aims to provide the current status of the 
recent advances in various injectable nanomedicines for targeted treatment of 
breast cancer."
1273,"Aptamer-drug conjugates (ApDCs) are potential targeted pharmaceutics, but their 
clinical applications are hampered by fast clearance in blood. Herein we report 
the construction of ApDCs modified with artificial base F and the study of 
biological activities. Two types of F-base-modified ApDCs were prepared, 
Sgc8-paclitaxel by conjugation and Sgc8-gemcitabine, by automated solid-phase 
synthesis. In vitro experiments showed that F-base-modified ApDCs retain the 
specificity of the aptamer to target cells and the biological stability is 
improved. In vivo studies demonstrated that the circulatory time is increased by 
up to 55 h or longer, as the incorporated F base leads to a stable ApDC-albumin 
complex as the formulation for targeted delivery. Moreover, conjugated drug 
molecules were released efficiently and the drug (paclitaxel) concentration in 
the tumor site was improved. The results demonstrate that an F-base-directed 
ApDC-albumin complex is a potential platform for drug delivery and targeted 
cancer therapy."
1274,"Four platinum(IV) prodrugs incorporating a biotin moiety to selectively target 
cancer cells were synthesised, characterised, and their biological activity 
assessed. All complexes exhibited exceptional in vitro cytotoxicity against a 
panel of cancer cell lines, with 
[Pt(5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(1S,2S-diaminocyclohexane)(biotin)(hydroxido)](NO3)2, 
(2) exhibiting the lowest GI50 of 4 nM in the prostate Du145 cancer cell line. 
Each complex displayed significantly enhanced activity compared to cisplatin, 
with 2 being 1000-fold more active in the HT29 colon cancer cell line. Against 
the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, in which high levels of biotin receptors are 
expressed, 2, 
[Pt(4,7-dimethoxy-1,10-phenanthroline)(1S,2S-diaminocyclohexane)(biotin)(hydroxido)](NO3)2, 
(3), and 
[Pt(5-methyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(1S,2S-diaminocyclohexane)(biotin)(hydroxido)](NO3)2, 
(4) exhibited enhanced activity compared to their platinum(II) cores, with 4 
being 6-fold more active than its platinum(II) precursor. Furthermore, 3 
exhibited 3-fold greater selectivity towards MCF-7 breast cancer cells compared 
to MCF10A breast healthy cells, and this was further confirmed by platinum 
uptake studies, which showed 3 to have almost 3-fold greater uptake in MCF-7 
cells, compared to MCF10A cells. The results show that lipophilicity and 
selectivity both contributed to the cellular uptake of 1-4; however, this was 
not always translated to the observed cytotoxicity."
1275,"Viscum album L., popularly known as mistletoe, is well known for its anti-cancer 
properties, and the pharmaceutical application of hydroalcoholic dry extracts is 
still limited due to its low solubility in aqueous media, and physicochemical 
instability. The Pluronic® F127 is an amphiphilic polymer, which permits the 
solubilization of lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds. In this investigation, 
physicochemical features of hydrogel containing V. album dry extract 
(VADE-loaded-hydrogel) were performed by: dynamic light scattering (DLS), 
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). VADE-loaded-hydrogel presented 
nanometer-size micelles with volume distribution ranging from 10.58 nm to 246.7 
nm, and a polydispersity index of 0.441. The sample thermal analyses (TG and 
DSC) showed similar decomposition curves; however, the thermal events indicated 
an increase in thermal stability in relation to the presence of the extract. In 
addition to these interesting pharmaceutical features, IC50 values of 333.40 
µg/mL and &gt;1000 µg/mL were obtained when tumor (SCC-25) and non-tumor (L929) 
cells were incubated with VADE-loaded-hydrogel, respectively. The optical and 
ultrastructural cellular analysis confirmed the tumor selectivity since the 
following alterations were detected only in SCC-25 cells: disorganization of 
plasmatic membrane; an increase of cytoplasmatic vacuole size; alteration in the 
cristae mitochondrial shape; and generation of amorphous cellular material. 
These results emphasize the promising antitumoral potential of 
VADE-loaded-hydrogel as an herbal drug delivery system via in vitro assays."
1276,"PURPOSE: Many natural agents have a high anticancer potential, and their 
combination may be advantageous for improved anticancer effects. Such agents, 
however, often are not water soluble and do not efficiently target cancer cells, 
and the kinetics of their action is poorly controlled. One way to overcome these 
barriers is to combine natural agents with nanoparticles. Our aim in the current 
study was to fabricate an anticancer nanoformulation for co-delivery of two 
natural agents, curcumin (CR) and colchicine (CL), with a core-shell structure. 
Using cancer cell lines, we compared the anticancer efficacy between the 
combination and a nanoformulation with CL alone.
METHODS: For the single-drug nanoformulation, we used phosphonate groups to 
functionalize mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and loaded the MSNs with 
CL. Additional loading of this nanoformulation with CR achieved the co-delivery 
format. To create the structure with a core shell, we selected a 
chitosan-cellulose mixture conjugated with targeting ligands of folic acid for 
the coating. For evaluating anticancer and apoptosis effects, we assessed 
changes in important genes and proteins in apoptosis (p53, caspase-3, Bax, 
Bcl-2) in several cell lines (MCF-7, breast adenocarcinoma; HCT-116, colon 
carcinoma; HOS, human osteosarcoma; and A-549, non-small cell lung cancer).
RESULTS: Nanoformulations were successfully synthesized and contained 10.9 wt.% 
for the CL single-delivery version and 18.1 wt.% for the CL+CR co-delivery 
nanoformulation. Anticancer effects depended on treatment, cell line, and 
concentration. Co-delivery nanoformulations exerted anticancer effects that were 
significantly superior to those of single delivery or free CL or CR. Anticancer 
effects by cell line were in the order of HCT-116 &gt; A549 &gt; HOS &gt; MCF-7. 
The lowest IC50 value was obtained for the nanoformulation consisting of CL and 
CR coated with a polymeric shell conjugated with FA (equivalent to 4.1 ± 0.05 
µg/mL). With dual delivery compared with the free agents, we detected strongly 
increased p53, caspase-3, and Bax expression, but inhibition of Bcl-2, 
suggesting promotion of apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, although preliminary, indicate that the proposed dual 
delivery nanoformulation consisting of nanocore: MSNs loaded with CL and CR and 
coated with a shell of chitosan-cellulose conjugated folic acid exerted strong 
anticancer and apoptotic effects with potent antitumor activity against HCT-116 
colon cells. The effect bested CL alone. Evaluating and confirming the efficacy 
of co-delivery nanoformulations will require in vivo studies."
1277,"Ovarian damage and fertility impairment are major side effects of chemotherapy 
in pre-menopausal cancer patients. Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic 
drug. The present study was designed to assess the ameliorative effects of 
melatonin as an adjuvant for fertility preservation. Thirty-two adult female 
Wistar rats were divided randomly into four equal groups: Control, Melatonin, 
Cisplatin (CP) treated, and CP + Melatonin treated. The cisplatin-treated group 
showed decreased body and ovarian weights, decreased serum E2 and AMH, increased 
serum LH and FSH, reduced ovarian levels of SOD, CAT, GSH, and TAC, and 
increased ovarian MDA. The histopathological examination of the 
cisplatin-treated group showed deleterious changes within ovarian tissue in the 
form of damaged follicles and corpus luteum, hemorrhage, and inflammatory 
infiltrates with faint PAS reaction in zona pellucida, increased ovarian 
collagen deposition, and marked expression of caspase-3 immune reaction in 
granulosa and theca cells, stroma, and oocytes. Alongside, there was a 
significant downregulation in the mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes, 
IL10, AMPK, PI3K, AKT, mTOR, and PTEN, while TGF-β1, IL1β, IL6, TNF-α, NF-Kβ, 
P53, p38-MAPK, JNK, and FOXO3 mRNA expressions were upregulated in 
cisplatin-treated rats' ovarian tissue. Coadministration of cisplatin-treated 
rats with melatonin reversed these changes significantly. In conclusion, 
melatonin's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities could 
modulate ovarian disturbances induced by cisplatin and preserve fertility."
1278,"Computed tomography (CT) is a diagnostic medical imaging modality commonly used 
to detect disease and injury. Contrast agents containing iodine, such as 
iohexol, are frequently used in CT examinations to more clearly differentiate 
anatomic structures and to detect and characterize abnormalities, including 
tumors. However, these contrast agents do not have a specific tropism for cancer 
cells, so the ability to detect tumors is severely limited by the degree of 
vascularization of the tumor itself. Identifying delivery systems allowing 
enrichment of contrast agents at the tumor site would increase the sensitivity 
of detection of tumors and metastases, potentially in organs that are normally 
inaccessible to contrast agents, such as the CNS. Recent work from our 
laboratory has identified cancer patient-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEVs) 
as effective delivery vehicles for targeting diagnostic drugs to patients' 
tumors. Based on this premise, we explored the possibility of introducing 
iohexol into PDEVs for targeted delivery to neoplastic tissue. Here, we provide 
preclinical proof-of-principle for the tumor-targeting ability of iohexol-loaded 
PDEVs, which resulted in an impressive accumulation of the contrast agent 
selectively into the neoplastic tissue, significantly improving the ability of 
the contrast agent to delineate tumor boundaries."
1279,"The antineoplastic activity of the thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR) inhibitor, 
auranofin (AF), has already been investigated in various cancer mouse models as 
a single drug, or in combination with other molecules. However, there are 
inconsistencies in the literature on the solvent, dose and administration route 
of AF treatment in vivo. Therefore, we investigated the solvent and 
administration route of AF in a syngeneic SB28 glioblastoma (GBM) C57BL/6J and a 
344SQ non-small cell lung cancer 129S2/SvPasCrl (129) mouse model. Compared to 
daily intraperitoneal injections and subcutaneous delivery of AF via osmotic 
minipumps, oral gavage for 14 days was the most suitable administration route 
for high doses of AF (10-15 mg/kg) in both mouse models, showing no measurable 
weight loss or signs of toxicity. A solvent comprising 50% DMSO, 40% PEG300 and 
10% ethanol improved the solubility of AF for oral administration in mice. In 
addition, we confirmed that AF was a potent TrxR inhibitor in SB28 GBM tumors at 
high doses. Taken together, our results and results in the literature indicate 
the therapeutic value of AF in several in vivo cancer models, and provide 
relevant information about AF's optimal administration route and solvent in two 
syngeneic cancer mouse models."
1280,"The lymphatic system has gained significant interest as a target tissue to 
control cancer progress, which highlights its central role in adaptive immune 
response. Numerous mechanistic studies have revealed the benefits of nano-sized 
materials in the transport of various cargos to lymph nodes, overcoming barriers 
associated with lymphatic physiology. The potential of sustained drug delivery 
systems in improving the therapeutic index of various immune modulating agents 
is also being actively discussed. Herein, we aim to discuss design rationales 
and principles of locoregional lymphatic drug delivery systems for invigorating 
adaptive immune response for efficient antitumor immunotherapy and provide 
examples of various advanced nanoparticle- and hydrogel-based formulations."
1281,"Ex vivo-produced dendritic cells (DCs) constitute the core of active cellular 
immunotherapy (ACI) for cancer treatment. After many disappointments in clinical 
trials, the current protocols for their preparation are attempting to boost 
their therapeutic efficacy by enhancing their functionality towards Th1 response 
and capability to induce the expansion of cytotoxic tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. 
LL-37 is an antimicrobial peptide with strong immunomodulatory potential. This 
potential was previously found to either enhance or suppress the desired 
anti-tumor DC functionality when used at different phases of their ex vivo 
production. In this work, we show that LL-37 can be implemented during the whole 
process of DC production in a way that allows LL-37 to enhance the anti-tumor 
functionality of produced DCs. We found that the supplementation of LL-37 during 
the differentiation of monocyte-derived DCs showed only a tendency to enhance 
their in vitro-induced lymphocyte enrichment with CD8+ T cells. The 
supplementation of LL-37 also during the process of DC antigen loading 
(pulsation) and maturation significantly enhanced the cell culture enrichment 
with CD8+ T cells. Moreover, this enrichment was also associated with the 
downregulated expression of PD-1 in CD8+ T cells, significantly higher frequency 
of tumor cell-reactive CD8+ T cells, and superior in vitro cytotoxicity against 
tumor cells. These data showed that LL-37 implementation into the whole process 
of the ex vivo production of DCs could significantly boost their anti-tumor 
performance in ACI."
1282,"The major risk factor associated with the development of gastric cancer is 
chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori. The available treatments, based on a 
cocktail of antibiotics, fail in up to 40% of patients and disrupt their gut 
microbiota. The potential of blank nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) for H. 
pylori eradication was previously demonstrated by us. However, the effect of NLC 
charge, size and protein corona on H. pylori-specific bactericidal activity 
herein studied was unknown at that time. All developed NLC formulations proved 
bactericidal against H. pylori. Although cationic NLC had 10-fold higher 
bactericidal activity than anionic NLC, they lacked specificity, since 
Lactobacillus acidophilus was also affected. Anionic NLC achieved complete 
clearance in both H. pylori morphologies (rod- and coccoid-shape) by inducing 
alterations in bacteria membranes and the cytoplasm, as visualized by 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The presence of an NLC protein corona, 
composed of 93% albumin, was confirmed by mass spectrometry. This protein corona 
delayed the bactericidal activity of anionic NLC against H. pylori and hindered 
NLC activity against Escherichia coli. Overall, these results sustain the use of 
NLC as a promising antibiotic-free strategy targeting H. pylori."
1283,"Microenvironmental factors such as non-classical human leukocyte antigen-G 
(HLA-G) have been associated with cancer invasiveness and metastatic 
progression. HLA-G expression has been associated with specific 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in HLA-G 3'untranslated region (UTR) in 
several diseases. The primary aim was to investigate the predictive role of 
HLA-G polymorphisms on treatment efficacy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) 
patients homogeneously treated with first-line FOLFIRI (irinotecan, 
5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin) and their association with soluble HLA-G 
(sHLA-G) plasma concentration. HLA-G 3'UTR was sequenced in 248 patients. A set 
of eight polymorphisms and related haplotypes were analyzed for their 
association with best tumor response, overall survival (OS), and 
progression-free survival (PFS). sHLA-G was measured by immunoassay in 35 
available plasma samples and correlated with HLA-G 3'UTR 
polymorphisms/haplotypes. Our results showed that carriers of rs371194629 
(+2960)-Ins allele were at risk for lack of complete response (hazard ratio 
(HR):0.29, pBH = 0.0336), while carriers of rs1710 (+3010)-G allele (rs1063320 
(+3142)-C allele in linkage-disequilibrium), and rs9380142 (+3187)-G allele had 
a higher chance of complete response according to additive models (HR:4.58, pBH 
= 0.0245; HR:3.18, pBH = 0.0336, respectively). The combination of 
rs371194629-Del, rs1710-G, and rs9380142-G alleles forms the UTR1 haplotype. 
Patients who were carriers of UTR1/UTR-1 diplotype had a greater chance of 
complete response to therapy (HR:10.59, pBH = 0.0294). The same three beneficial 
alleles showed a trend toward higher pre-treatment sHLA-G plasma levels, 
supporting a functional role for polymorphisms in protein secretion. In 
conclusion, genetic variants of HLA-G are associated with treatment efficacy in 
mCRC patients treated with first-line FOLFIRI. This finding shed light on the 
combined effect of this immune system factor and chemotherapy in cancer 
patients."
1284,"This study reports the CD44 receptor-targeted gold-doxorubicin nanocomposite 
(TGNC-DOX) for pulsatile chemo-photothermal therapy of triple-negative breast 
cancer (TNBC). The developed TGNC-DOX was nanometric, having a particle size of 
71.34 ± 3.66 nm. The doxorubicin was loaded by electrostatic interaction with 
high entrapment and loading efficiency (&gt;75%). TGNC-DOX showed potent 
photothermal response and reversible photothermal stability following 
irradiation with 808 nm NIR laser irradiation. Further, TGNC-DOX showed 
laser-responsive and pH-dependent drug release behavior suggesting its 
suitability for chemo-photothermal therapy, specifically at the tumor 
microenvironment site. Cellular viability, cellular uptake, ROS generation, and 
apoptosis assays suggested selective localization of TGNC-DOX in cancer cells 
that showed a significant cytotoxic effect against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer 
cells. Moreover, the developed TGNC-DOX showed ferroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. 
The event of TGNC-DOX-mediated thermal ablation is marked by a significant 
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis, as affirmed by flow 
cytometry. NIR-808 laser-responsive photothermal therapy of cancer cells was 
found to be more effective than without NIR-808 laser-treated cells, suggesting 
the fundamental role of photothermal ablation. The outcome concludes developed 
TGNC-DOX is a novel and potential tool to mediate laser-guided 
chemo-photothermal ablation treatment of cancer cells."
1285,"INTRODUCTION: Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) is an emerging target for imaging 
and therapy of many types of cancer. Nuclear imaging of NTSR1 allows for 
noninvasive assessment of the receptor levels of NTSR1 on the primary tumor, as 
well as potential metastases. This work focuses on a the neurotensin peptide 
analogue NT-20.3 conjugated to the chelator NOTA for radiolabeling for use in 
noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET). NOTA-NT-20.3 was radiolabeled 
with gallium-68, copper-64, and cobalt-55 to determine the effect that 
modification of the radiometal has on imaging and potential therapeutic 
properties of NOTA-NT-20.3.
METHODS: In vitro assays investigating cell uptake and subcellular localization 
of the radiolabeled peptides were performed using human colorectal 
adenocarcinoma HT29 cells. In vivo PET/CT imaging was used to determine the 
distribution and clearance of the peptide in mice bearing NTSR1 expressing HT29 
tumors.
RESULTS: Cell uptake studies showed that the highest uptake was obtained with 
[55Co] Co-NOTA-NT-20.3 (18.70 ± 1.30%ID/mg), followed by [64Cu] Cu-NOTA-NT-20.3 
(15.46 ± 0.91%ID/mg), and lastly [68Ga] Ga-NOTA-NT-20.3 (10.94 ± 0.46%ID/mg) (p 
&lt; 0.001). Subcellular distribution was similar across the three constructs, 
with the membranous fraction containing the highest amount of radioactivity. In 
vivo PET/CT imaging of the three constructs revealed similar distribution and 
tumor uptake at the 1 h imaging timepoint. Tumor uptake was receptor-specific 
and blockable by co-injection of non-radiolabeled NOTA-NT-20.3. SUV ratios of 
tumor to heart at the 24 h imaging timepoint show that [55Co] Co-NOTA-NT-20.3 
(20.28 ± 3.04) outperformed [64Cu] Cu-NOTA-NT-20.3 (6.52 ± 1.97). In conclusion, 
our studies show that enhanced cell uptake and increasing tumor to blood ratios 
over time displayed the superiority of [55Co] Co-NOTA-NT-20.3 over [68Ga] 
Ga-NOTA-NT-20.3 and [64Cu] Cu-NOTA-NT-20.3 for the targeting of NTSR1."
1286,"Biologic-based medicines are used to treat a variety of diseases and account for 
around one-quarter of the worldwide pharmaceutical market. The use of biologic 
medications among cancer patients has resulted in substantial advancements in 
cancer treatment and supportive care. Biosimilar medications (or biosimilars) 
are very similar to the reference biologic drugs, although they are not 
identical. As patent protection for some of the most extensively used biologics 
begins to expire, biosimilars have the potential to enhance access and provide 
lower-cost options for cancer treatment. Initially, regulatory guidelines were 
set up in Europe in 2003, and the first biosimilar was approved in 2006 in 
Europe. Many countries, including the United States of America (USA), Canada, 
and Japan, have adopted Europe's worldwide regulatory framework. The use of 
numerous biosimilars in the treatment and supportive care of cancer has been 
approved and, indeed, the count is set to climb in the future around the world. 
However, there are many challenges associated with biosimilars, such as cost, 
immunogenicity, lack of awareness, extrapolation of indications, and 
interchangeability. The purpose of this review is to provide an insight into 
biosimilars, which include various options available for oncology, and the 
associated adverse events. We compare the regulatory guidelines for biosimilars 
across the world, and also present the latest trends and challenges in medical 
oncology both now and in the future, which will assist healthcare professionals, 
payers, and patients in making informed decisions, increasing the acceptance of 
biosimilars in clinical practice, increasing accessibility, and speeding up the 
health and economic benefits associated with biosimilars."
1287,"BACKGROUND: Breast tumor inflammation is an immunological process that occurs 
mainly by mediation of Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAM). Aiming for a specific 
measurement of tumor inflammation, the current study evaluated the potential of 
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with [11C](R)-PK11195 to evaluate 
tumor inflammation in a mammary tumor animal model.
METHODS: Female Balb/C mice were inoculated with 4T1 cells. The PET imaging with 
[11C](R)-PK11195 and [18F]FDG was acquired 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks after 
cell inoculation.
RESULTS: The [11C](R)-PK11195 tumor uptake increased from 3 days to 1 week, and 
decreased at 2 weeks after cell inoculation, as opposed to the [18F]FDG uptake, 
which showed a slight decrease in uptake at 1 week and increased uptake at 2 
weeks. In the control group, no significant differences occurred in tracer 
uptake over time. Tumor uptake of both radiopharmaceuticals is more expressed in 
tumor edge regions, with greater intensity at 2 weeks, as demonstrated by 
[11C](R)-PK11195 autoradiography and immunofluorescence with TSPO antibodies and 
CD86 pro-inflammatory phenotype.
CONCLUSION: The [11C](R)-PK11195 was able to identify heterogeneous tumor 
inflammation in a murine model of breast cancer and the uptake varied according 
to tumor size. Together with the glycolytic marker [18F]FDG, molecular imaging 
with [11C](R)-PK11195 may provide a better characterization of inflammatory 
responses in cancer."
1288,"Cancer is the leading cause of death after cardiovascular disease. Despite 
significant advances in cancer research over the past few decades, it is almost 
impossible to cure end-stage cancer patients and bring them to remission. 
Adverse effects of chemotherapy are mainly caused by the accumulation of 
chemotherapeutic agents in normal tissues, and drug resistance hinders the 
potential therapeutic effects and curing of this disease. New drug formulations 
need to be developed to overcome these problems and increase the therapeutic 
index of chemotherapeutics. As a chemotherapeutic delivery platform, 
three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds are an up-and-coming option because they can 
respond to biological factors, modify their properties accordingly, and promote 
site-specific chemotherapeutic deliveries in a sustainable and controlled 
release manner. This review paper focuses on the features and applications of 
the variety of 3D scaffold-based nano-delivery systems that could be used to 
improve local cancer therapy by selectively delivering chemotherapeutics to the 
target sites in future."
1289,"Perhaps the greatest limitation for the continually advancing developments in 
cancer immunotherapy remains the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). 
The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) axis 
is an emerging immunotherapy target, with the resulting type I interferons and 
transcription factors acting at several levels in both tumor and immune cells 
for the generation of adaptive T cell responses. The cGAS-STING axis activation 
by therapeutic agents that induce DNA damage, such as certain chemotherapies, 
continues to be reported, highlighting the importance of the interplay of this 
signaling pathway and the DNA damage response in cancer immunity/immunotherapy. 
We have developed a multi-targeted mannosylated cationic liposomal 
immunomodulatory system (DS) which contains low doses of the chemotherapeutic 
cytarabine (Ara-C). In this work, we show that entrapment of non-cytotoxic doses 
of Ara-C within the DS improves its ability to induce DNA double strand breaks 
in human ovarian and colorectal cancer cell lines, as well as in various immune 
cells. Importantly, for the first time we demonstrate that the DNA damage 
induced by Ara-C/DS translates into cGAS-STING axis activation. We further 
demonstrate that Ara-C/DS-mediated DNA damage leads to upregulation of surface 
expression of immune ligands on cancer cells, coinciding with priming of 
cytotoxic lymphocytes as assessed using an ex vivo model of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells from colorectal cancer patients, as well as an in vitro NK 
cell model. Overall, the results highlight a broad immunotherapeutic potential 
for Ara-C/DS by enhancing tumor-directed inflammatory responses."
1290,"Tumor organoids are defined as self-organized three-dimensional assemblies of 
heterogeneous cell types derived from patient samples that mimic the key 
histopathological, genetic, and phenotypic characteristics of the original 
tumor. This technology is proposed as an ideal candidate for the evaluation of 
possible therapies against cancer, presenting advantages over other models which 
are currently used. However, there are no reports in the literature that relate 
the techniques and material development of tumor organoids or that emphasize in 
the physicochemical and biological properties of materials that intent to 
biomimicry the tumor extracellular matrix. There is also little information 
regarding the tools to identify the correspondence of native tumors and tumoral 
organoids (tumoroids). Moreover, this paper relates the advantages of organoids 
compared to other models for drug evaluation. A growing interest in tumoral 
organoids has arisen from 2009 to the present, aimed at standardizing the 
process of obtaining organoids, which more accurately resemble patient-derived 
tumor tissue. Likewise, it was found that the characteristics to consider for 
the development of organoids, and therapeutic responses of them, are cell 
morphology, physiology, the interaction between cells, the composition of the 
cellular matrix, and the genetic, phenotypic, and epigenetic characteristics. 
Currently, organoids have been used for the evaluation of drugs for brain, lung, 
and colon tumors, among others. In the future, tumor organoids will become 
closer to being considered a better model for studying cancer in clinical 
practice, as they can accurately mimic the characteristics of tumors, in turn 
ensuring that the therapeutic response aligns with the clinical response of 
patients."
1291,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and battling cancer has 
always been a challenging subject in medical sciences. All over the world, 
scientists from different fields of study try to gain a deeper knowledge about 
the biology and roots of cancer and, consequently, provide better strategies to 
fight against it. During the past few decades, nanoparticles (NPs) have 
attracted much attention for the delivery of therapeutic and diagnostic agents 
with high efficiency and reduced side effects in cancer treatment. Targeted and 
stimuli-sensitive nanoparticles have been widely studied for cancer therapy in 
recent years, and many more studies are ongoing. This review aims to provide a 
broad view of different nanoparticle systems with characteristics that allow 
them to target diverse properties of the tumor microenvironment (TME) from 
nanoparticles that can be activated and release their cargo due to the specific 
characteristics of the TME (such as low pH, redox, and hypoxia) to nanoparticles 
that can target different cellular and molecular targets of the present cell and 
molecules in the TME."
1292,"According to the WHO, cancer caused almost 10 million deaths worldwide in 2020, 
i.e., almost one in six deaths. Among the most common are breast, lung, colon 
and rectal and prostate cancers. Although the diagnosis is more perfect and 
spectrum of available drugs is large, there is a clear trend of an increase in 
cancer that ends fatally. A major advance in treatment was the introduction of 
gentler antineoplastics for targeted therapy-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). 
Although they have undoubtedly revolutionized oncology and hematology, they have 
significant side effects and limited efficacy. In addition to the design of new 
TKIs with improved pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, and being more resistant 
to the development of drug resistance, high expectations are placed on the 
reformulation of TKIs into various drug delivery lipid-based nanosystems. This 
review provides an insight into the history of chemotherapy, a brief overview of 
the development of TKIs for the treatment of cancer and their mechanism of 
action and summarizes the results of the applications of self-nanoemulsifying 
drug delivery systems, nanoemulsions, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, 
lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers used as 
drug delivery systems of TKIs obtained in vitro and in vivo."
1293,"Alpha-particle radiotherapy has gained considerable attention owing to its 
potent anti-cancer effect. 211At, with a relatively short half-life of 7.2 h, 
emits an alpha particle within a few cell diameters with high kinetic energy, 
which damages cancer cells with high biological effectiveness. In this study, we 
investigated the intravenous injection of 211At-labeled gold nanoparticles 
(AuNPs) for targeted alpha-particle therapy (TAT). Different kinds of 
surface-modified gold nanoparticles can be labeled with 211At in high 
radiochemical yield in 5 min, and no purification is necessary. The in vivo 
biodistribution results showed the accumulation of 5 nm 211At-AuNPs@mPEG at 
2.25% injection dose per gram (% ID/g) in tumors within 3 h via the enhanced 
permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Additionally, we observed a long 
retention time in tumor tissues within 24 h. This is the first study to 
demonstrate the anti-tumor efficacy of 5 nm 211At-AuNPs@mPEG that can 
significantly suppress tumor growth in a pancreatic cancer model via intravenous 
administration. AuNPs are satisfactory carriers for 211At delivery, due to 
simple and efficient synthesis processes and high stability. The intravenous 
administration of 5 nm 211At-AuNPs@mPEG has a significant anti-tumor effect. 
This study provides a new framework for designing nanoparticles suitable for 
targeted alpha-particle therapy via intravenous injection."
1294,"Over the last few years, research on silica nanoparticles has rapidly increased. 
Particularly on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), as nanocarriers for the 
treatment of various diseases because of their physicochemical properties and 
biocompatibility. The use of MSNs combined with therapeutic agents can provide 
better encapsulation and effective delivery. MSNs as nanocarriers might also be 
a promising tool to lower the therapeutic dosage levels and thereby to reduce 
undesired side effects. Researchers have explored several routes to conjugate 
both imaging and therapeutic agents onto MSNs, thus expanding their potential as 
theranostic platforms, in order to allow for the early diagnosis and treatment 
of diseases. This review introduces a general overview of recent advances in the 
field of silica nanoparticles. In particular, the review tackles the fundamental 
aspects of silicate materials, including a historical presentation to new 
silicates and then focusing on the key parameters that govern the tailored 
synthesis of functional MSNs. Finally, the biomedical applications of MSNs are 
briefly revised, along with their biocompatibility, biodistribution and 
degradation. This review aims to provide the reader with the tools for a 
rational design of biocompatible MSNs for their application in the biomedical 
field. Particular attention is paid to the role that the synthesis conditions 
have on the physicochemical properties of the resulting MSNs, which, in turn, 
will determine their pharmacological behavior. Several recent examples are 
highlighted to stress the potential that MSNs hold as drug delivery systems, for 
biomedical imaging, as vaccine adjuvants and as theragnostic agents."
1295,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant neoplasm of the bile ducts, being the 
second most common type of cancer in the liver, and most patients are diagnosed 
at a late stage with poor prognosis. Targeted therapy aiming at receptors 
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as c-Met or EGFR have been developed but with 
unsatisfactory outcomes. In our recent report, we found several oncogenic 
molecules downstream of RTKs, including hydrogen peroxide clone-5 (Hic-5), Src, 
AKT and JNK, were elevated in tissues of a significant portion of metastatic 
CCAs. By inhibitor studies and a knockdown approach, these molecules were found 
to be within the same signal cascade responsible for the migration of HuCCT1 
cells, a conventionally used CCA cell line. Herein, we also found Src inhibitor 
dasatinib and Hic-5 siRNA corporately suppressed HuCCT1 cell invasion. Moreover, 
dasatinib inhibited the progression of the HuCCT1 tumor on SCID mice skin 
coupled with decreasing the expression of Hic-5 and EGFR and the activities of 
Src, AKT and JNK. In addition, we found a glycolytic enzyme 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and several cytoskeletal 
molecules such as tubulin and cofilin were dramatically decreased after a 
long-term treatment of the HuCCT1 tumor with a high dose of dasatinib. 
Specifically, GAPDH was shown to be a downstream effector of the Hic-5/Src/AKT 
cascade involved in HuCCT1 cell migration. On the other hand, TFK1, another CCA 
cell line without Hic-5 expression, exhibited very low motility, whereas an 
ectopic Hic-5 expression enhanced the activation of Src and AKT and marginally 
increased TFK1 migration. In the future, it is tempting to investigate whether 
cotargeting Src, Hic-5 and/or GAPDH is efficient for preventing CCA progression 
in future clinical trials."
1296,"Calcium-doped manganese ferrite nanoparticles (NPs) are gaining special interest 
in the biomedical field due to their lower cytotoxicity compared with other 
ferrites, and the fact that they have improved magnetic properties. Magnetic 
hyperthermia (MH) is an alternative cancer treatment, in which magnetic 
nanoparticles promote local heating that can lead to the apoptosis of cancer 
cells. In this work, manganese/calcium ferrite NPs coated with citrate 
(CaxMn1-xFe2O4 (x = 0, 0.2, 1), were synthesized by the sol-gel method, followed 
by calcination, and then characterized regarding their crystalline structure (by 
X-ray diffraction, XRD), size and shape (by Transmission Electron Microscopy, 
TEM), hydrodynamic size and zeta potential (by Dynamic Light Scattering, DLS), 
and heating efficiency (measuring the Specific Absorption Rate, SAR, and 
Intrinsic Loss Power, ILP) under an alternating magnetic field. The obtained NPs 
showed a particle size within the range of 10 nm to 20 nm (by TEM) with a 
spherical or cubic shape. Ca0.2Mn0.8Fe2O4 NPs exhibited the highest SAR value of 
36.3 W/g at the lowest field frequency tested, and achieved a temperature 
variation of ~7 °C in 120 s, meaning that these NPs are suitable magnetic 
hyperthermia agents. In vitro cellular internalization and cytotoxicity 
experiments, performed using the human cell line HEK 293T, confirmed 
cytocompatibility over 0-250 µg/mL range and successful internalization after 24 
h. Based on these studies, our data suggest that these manganese-calcium ferrite 
NPs have potential for MH application and further use in in vivo systems."
1297,"Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare form of cancer with local as well as 
systemic manifestations. Concomitant bacterial infections increase morbidity and 
mortality rates due to impaired skin barrier and immune deficiency. In the 
current study, we demonstrated that the in vitro anti-lymphoma potential of 
erufosine is diminished by TWIST1 expression and micellar curcumin substantially 
increases its antineoplastic activity. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the 
micellar curcumin (MCRM) used in our study was characterized by low zeta 
potential, slow release of curcumin, and fast cell membrane penetration. The 
combination ratio 1:4 [erufosine:MCRM] achieved strong synergism by inhibiting 
cell proliferation and clonogenicity. The combined antiproliferative effects 
were calculated using the symbolic mathematical software MAPLE 15. The 
synergistic combination strongly decreased the expression of TWIST1 and protein 
kinase B/Akt as proven by western blotting. Significant reductions in NF-κB 
activation, induction of apoptosis, and altered glutathione levels were 
demonstrated by corresponding assays. In addition, the synergistic combination 
enhanced the anti-staphylococcal activity and prevented biofilm formation, as 
shown by crystal violet staining. Taken together, the above results show that 
the development of nanotechnological treatment modalities for CTCL, based on 
rational drug combinations exhibiting parallel antineoplastic and antibacterial 
effects, may prove efficacious."
1298,"Rizatriptan (RZT) is an efficient anti-migraine drug which belongs to the class 
of selective 5 HT (1B/1D) serotonin receptor agonists. Nevertheless, RZT elicits 
several adverse effects and RZT nasal sprays have a limited half-life, requiring 
repeated doses that could cause patient noncompliance or harm to the nasopharynx 
and cilia. The current research aimed to develop orally disintegrating films 
(ODFs) of RZT employing maltodextrin (MTX) and pullulan (PUL) as film-forming 
polymers, as well as propylene glycol (PG) as a plasticizer. The ODFs were 
prepared by solvent casting method (SCM). The technique was optimized using 
Box-Behnken design (BBD), contemplating the ratios of PUL: MTX and different 
levels of PG (%) as factor variables. The influence of these factors was 
systematically analyzed on the selected dependent variables, including film 
thickness, disintegration time (D-time), folding endurance (FE), tensile 
strength (TS), percent elongation (%E), moisture content (%), and water uptake 
(%). In addition, the surface morphology, solid state analysis, drug content 
uniformity (%), drug release (%), and pH of the RZT-ODFs were also studied. The 
results demonstrated a satisfactory stable RZT-ODFs formulation that exhibited 
surface homogeneity and amorphous RZT in films with no discernible interactions 
between the model drug and polymeric materials. The optimized film showed a 
rapid D-time of 16 s and remarkable mechanical features. The in vitro 
dissolution kinetics showed that 100% RZT was released from optimized film 
compared to 61% RZT released from conventional RZT formulation in the initial 5 
min. An animal pharmacokinetic (PK) investigation revealed that RZT-ODFs had a 
shorter time to achieve peak plasma concentration (Tmax), a higher maximum 
plasma concentration (Cmax), and area under the curve (AUC0-t) than traditional 
oral mini capsules. These findings proposed a progressive approach for 
developing anti-migraine drugs that could be useful in reducing the 
complications of dysphagia in geriatric and pediatric sufferers."
1299,"In order to improve the efficacy of doxorubicin in the treatment of breast 
cancer, we constructed a drug delivery system combined with local administration 
of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) and photothermal-material polypyrrole 
nanoparticles (PPY NPs). In vitro cytotoxicity experiments showed that the 
inhibitory effect of DOX + LBP + PPY NPs on 4T1 cells under NIR (near infrared) 
laser was eight times that of DOX at the same concentration (64% vs. 8%). In 
vivo antitumor experiments showed that the tumor inhibition rate of LBP + DOX + 
PPY NPs + NIR reached 87.86%. The results of the H&E staining and biochemical 
assays showed that the systemic toxicity of LBP + DOX + PPY NPs + NIR group was 
reduced, and liver damage was significantly lower in the combined topical 
administration group (ALT 54 ± 14.44 vs. 28 ± 3.56; AST 158 ± 16.39 vs. 111 ± 
20.85) (p &lt; 0.05). The results of the Elisa assay showed that LBP + DOX + PPY 
NPs + NIR can enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity (IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IgA, 
ROS). In conclusion, LBP + DOX + PPY NPs combined with photothermal therapy can 
improve the therapeutic effect of DOX on breast cancer and reduce its toxic side 
effects."
1300,"The usage of peptide-based drugs to combat cancer is gaining significance in the 
pharmaceutical industry. The collateral damage caused to normal cells due to the 
use of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc. has given an impetus to the search for 
alternative methods of cancer treatment. For a long time, antimicrobial peptides 
(AMPs) have been shown to display anticancer activity. However, the 
immunomodulatory activity of anti-cancer peptides has not been researched very 
extensively. The interconnection of cancer and immune responses is well-known. 
Hence, a search and design of molecules that can show anti-cancer and 
immunomodulatory activity can be lead molecules in this field. A large number of 
anti-cancer peptides show good immunomodulatory activity by inhibiting the 
pro-inflammatory responses that assist cancer progression. Here, we thoroughly 
review both the naturally occurring and synthetic anti-cancer peptides that are 
reported to possess both anti-cancer and immunomodulatory activity. We also 
assess the structural and biophysical parameters that can be utilized to improve 
the activity. Both activities are mostly reported by different groups, however, 
we discuss them together to highlight their interconnection, which can be used 
in the future to design peptide drugs in the field of cancer therapeutics."
1301,"Interaction between cationic surfactants and nucleic acids attracts much 
attention due to the possibility of using such systems for gene delivery. 
Herein, the lipoplexes based on cationic surfactants with imidazolium head group 
bearing methoxyphenyl fragment (MPI-n, n = 10, 12, 14, 16) and nucleic acids 
(oligonucleotide and plasmid DNA) were explored. The complex formation was 
confirmed by dynamic/electrophoretic light scattering, transmission electron 
microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and gel 
electrophoresis. The nanosized lipoplex formation (of about 100-200 nm), 
contributed by electrostatic, hydrophobic interactions, and intercalation 
mechanism, has been shown. Significant effects of the hydrocarbon tail length of 
surfactant and the type of nucleic acid on their interaction was revealed. The 
cytotoxic effect and transfection ability of lipoplexes studied were determined 
using M-HeLa, A549 cancer cell lines, and normal Chang liver cells. A selective 
reduced cytotoxic effect of the complexes on M-HeLa cancer cells was 
established, as well as a high ability of the systems to be transfected into 
cancer cells. MPI-n/DNA complexes showed a pronounced transfection activity 
equal to the commercial preparation Lipofectamine 3000. Thus, it has been shown 
that MPI-n surfactants are effective agents for nucleic acid condensation and 
can be considered as potential non-viral vectors for gene delivery."
1302,"The use of natural compounds is becoming increasingly popular among patients, 
and there is a renewed interest among scientists in nature-based bioactive 
agents. Traditionally, herbal drugs can be taken directly in the form of 
teas/decoctions/infusions or as standardized extracts. However, the 
disadvantages of natural compounds, especially essential oils, are their 
instability, limited bioavailability, volatility, and often irritant/allergenic 
potential. However, these active substances can be stabilized by encapsulation 
and administered in the form of nanoparticles. This brief overview summarizes 
the latest results of the application of nanoemulsions, liposomes, solid lipid 
nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers used as drug delivery systems 
of herbal essential oils or used directly for their individual secondary 
metabolites applicable in cancer therapy. Although the discussed bioactive 
agents are not typical compounds used as anticancer agents, after inclusion into 
the aforesaid formulations improving their stability and bioavailability and/or 
therapeutic profile, they indicated anti-tumor activity and became interesting 
agents with cancer treatment potential. In addition, co-encapsulation of 
essential oils with synthetic anticancer drugs into nanoformulations with the 
aim to achieve synergistic effect in chemotherapy is discussed."
1303,"Messenger RNA (mRNA), which is composed of ribonucleotides that carry genetic 
information and direct protein synthesis, is transcribed from a strand of DNA as 
a template. On this basis, mRNA technology can take advantage of the body's own 
translation system to express proteins with multiple functions for the treatment 
of various diseases. Due to the advancement of mRNA synthesis and purification, 
modification and sequence optimization technologies, and the emerging lipid 
nanomaterials and other delivery systems, mRNA therapeutic regimens are becoming 
clinically feasible and exhibit significant reliability in mRNA stability, 
translation efficiency, and controlled immunogenicity. Lipid nanoparticles 
(LNPs), currently the leading non-viral delivery vehicles, have made many 
exciting advances in clinical translation as part of the COVID-19 vaccines and 
therefore have the potential to accelerate the clinical translation of gene 
drugs. Additionally, due to their small size, biocompatibility, and 
biodegradability, LNPs can effectively deliver nucleic acids into cells, which 
is particularly important for the current mRNA regimens. Therefore, the 
cutting-edge LNP@mRNA regimens hold great promise for cancer vaccines, 
infectious disease prevention, protein replacement therapy, gene editing, and 
rare disease treatment. To shed more lights on LNP@mRNA, this paper mainly 
discusses the rational of choosing LNPs as the non-viral vectors to deliver 
mRNA, the general rules for mRNA optimization and LNP preparation, and the 
various parameters affecting the delivery efficiency of LNP@mRNA, and finally 
summarizes the current research status as well as the current challenges. The 
latest research progress of LNPs in the treatment of other diseases such as 
oncological, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases is also given. Finally, the 
future applications and perspectives for LNP@mRNA are generally introduced."
1304,"Obtusifolin, a major anthraquinone component present in the seeds of Cassia 
tora, exhibits several biological activities, including the amelioration of 
memory impairment, prevention of breast cancer metastasis, and reduction of 
cartilage damage in osteoarthritis. We aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effects 
of obtusifolin and its analogs on CYP1A enzymes, which are responsible for 
activating procarcinogens, and investigate its inhibitory mechanism and 
chemopreventive effects. P450-selective substrates were incubated with human 
liver microsomes (HLMs) or recombinant CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in the presence of 
obtusifolin and its four analogs. After incubation, the samples were analyzed 
using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Molecular docking 
simulations were performed using the crystal structure of CYP1A2 to identify the 
critical interactions between anthraquinones and human CYP1A2. Obtusifolin 
potently and selectively inhibited CYP1A2-mediated phenacetin O-deethylation 
(POD) with a Ki value of 0.031 µM in a competitive inhibitory manner in HLMs, 
whereas it exhibited negligible inhibitory effect against other P450s (IC50 &gt; 
28.6 µM). Obtusifolin also inhibited CYP1A1- and CYP1A2-mediated POD and 
ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation with IC50 values of &lt;0.57 µM when using 
recombinant enzymes. Our molecular docking models suggested that the high CYP1A2 
inhibitory activity of obtusifolin may be attributed to the combination of 
hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. This is the first report of 
selective and potent inhibitory effects of obtusifolin against CYP1A, indicating 
their potential chemopreventive effects."
1305,"Following our previous study on the development of EGFR-targeted nanomedicine 
(NM-scFv) for the active delivery of siRNA in EGFR-positive cancers, this study 
focuses on the development and the quality control of a radiolabeling method to 
track it in in vivo conditions with nuclear imaging. Our NM-scFv is based on the 
electrostatic complexation of targeted nanovector (NV-scFv), siRNA and two 
cationic polymers. NV-scFv comprises an inorganic core, a fluorescent dye, a 
polymer layer and anti-EGFR ligands. To track NM-scFv in vivo with nuclear 
imaging, the DTPA chemistry was used to radiolabel NM-scFv with 111In. DTPA was 
thiolated and introduced onto NV-scFv via the maleimide chemistry. To obtain 
suitable radiolabeling efficiency, different DTPA/NV-scFv ratios were tested, 
including 0.03, 0.3 and 0.6. At the optimized ratio (where the DTPA/NV-scFv 
ratio was 0.3), a high radiolabeling yield was achieved (98%) and neither 
DTPA-derivatization nor indium-radiolabeling showed any impact on NM-scFv's 
physicochemical characteristics (DH ~100 nm, PDi &lt; 0.24). The selected 
NM-scFv-DTPA demonstrated good siRNA protection capacity and comparable in vitro 
transfection efficiency into EGFR-overexpressing cells in comparison to that of 
non-derivatized NM-scFv (around 67%). Eventually, it was able to track both 
qualitatively and quantitatively NM-scFv in in vivo environments with nuclear 
imaging. Both the radiolabeling and the NM-scFv showed a high in vivo stability 
level. Altogether, a radiolabeling method using DTPA chemistry was developed 
with success in this study to track our NM-scFv in in vivo conditions without 
any impact on its active targeting and physicochemical properties, highlighting 
the potential of our NM-scFv for future theranostic applications in 
EGFR-overexpressing cancers."
1306,"Brachytherapy is one mainstay treatment for lung cancer. However, a great 
challenge in brachytherapy is radio-resistance, which is caused by severe 
hypoxia in solid tumors. In this research, we have developed a PEGylated 
131I-labeled CuS nanotheranostics (CuS-131I-PEG)-induced ""multiple 
mild-hyperthermia"" strategy to reverse hypoxia-associated radio-resistance. 
Specifically, after being injected with CuS-131I-PEG nanotheranostics, tumors 
were irradiated by NIR laser to mildly increase tumor temperature (39~40 °C). 
This mild hyperthermia can improve oxygen levels and reduce expression of 
hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α) inside tumors, which brings about alleviation 
of tumor hypoxia and reversion of hypoxia-induced radio-resistance. During the 
entire treatment, tumors are treated by photothermal brachytherapy three times, 
and meanwhile mild hyperthermia stimulation is conducted before each treatment 
of photothermal brachytherapy, which is defined as a ""multiple 
mild-hyperthermia"" strategy. Based on this strategy, tumors have been completely 
inhibited. Overall, our research presents a simple and effective ""multiple 
mild-hyperthermia"" strategy for reversing radio-resistance of lung cancer, 
achieving the combined photothermal brachytherapy."
1307,"Breast cancer is a prevalent tumor and causes deadly metastatic complications. 
Myriad cancer types, including breast cancer, are effectively treated by 
methotrexate (MTX). However, MTX hydrophobicity, adverse effects and the 
development of resistance have inspired a search for new effective strategies to 
overcome these challenges. These may include the addition of a bioenhancer 
and/or encapsulation into appropriate nano-based carriers. In the present study, 
the anticancer effect of MTX was fortified through dual approaches. First, the 
concomitant use of piperine (PIP) as a bioenhancer with MTX, which was 
investigated in the MCF-7 cell line. The results depicted significantly lower 
IC50 values for the combination (PIP/MTX) than for MTX. Second, PIP and MTX were 
individually nanoformulated into F-127 pluronic nanomicelles (PIP-NMs) and 
F-127/P-105 mixed pluronic nanomicelles (MTX-MNMs), respectively, validated by 
several characterization techniques, and the re-investigated cytotoxicity of 
PIP-NMs and MTX-MNMs was fortified. Besides, the PIP-NMs/MTX-MNMs demonstrated 
further cytotoxicity enhancement. The PIP-NMs/MTX-MNMs combination was analyzed 
by flow cytometry to understand the cell death mechanism. Moreover, the in vivo 
assessment of PIP-NMs/MTX-MNMs was adopted through the Ehrlich ascites model, 
which revealed a significant reduction of the tumor weight. However, some 
results of the tumor markers showed that the addition of PIP-NMs to MTX-MNMs did 
not significantly enhance the antitumor effect."
1308,"Sibiriline is a novel drug inhibiting receptor-interacting protein 1 kinase 
(RIPK1) and necroptosis, a regulated form of cell death involved in several 
disease models. In this study, we aimed to investigate the metabolic fate of 
sibiriline in a cross-sectional manner using an in silico prediction, coupled 
with in vitro and in vivo experiments. In silico predictions were performed 
using GLORYx and Biotransformer 3.0 freeware; in vitro incubation was performed 
on differentiated human HepaRG cells, and in vivo experiments including a 
pharmacokinetic study were performed on mice treated with sibiriline. HepaRG 
culture supernatants and mice plasma samples were analyzed with 
ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). The molecular networking bioinformatics tool applied 
to LC-HRMS/MS data allowed us to visualize the sibiriline metabolism kinetics. 
Overall, 14 metabolites, mostly produced by Phase II transformations 
(glucuronidation and sulfation) were identified. These data provide initial 
reassurance regarding the toxicology of this new RIPK1 inhibitor, although 
further studies are required."
1309,"Mitochondria are implicated in a wide range of functions apart from ATP 
generation, and, therefore, constitute one of the most important organelles of 
cell. Since healthy mitochondria are essential for proper cellular functioning 
and survival, mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to various pathologies. 
Mitochondria are considered a novel and promising therapeutic target for the 
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of various human diseases including 
metabolic disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. For 
mitochondria-targeted therapy, there is a need to develop an effective drug 
delivery approach, owing to the mitochondrial special bilayer structure through 
which therapeutic molecules undergo multiple difficulties in reaching the core. 
In recent years, various nanoformulations have been designed such as polymeric 
nanoparticles, liposomes, inorganic nanoparticles conjugate with 
mitochondriotropic moieties such as mitochondria-penetrating peptides (MPPs), 
triphenylphosphonium (TPP), dequalinium (DQA), and mitochondrial protein import 
machinery for overcoming barriers involved in targeting mitochondria. The 
current approaches used for mitochondria-targeted drug delivery have provided 
promising ways to overcome the challenges associated with targeted-drug 
delivery. Herein, we review the research from past years to the current scenario 
that has identified mitochondrial dysfunction as a major contributor to the 
pathophysiology of various diseases. Furthermore, we discuss the recent 
advancements in mitochondria-targeted drug delivery strategies for the 
pathologies associated with mitochondrial dysfunction."
1310,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a rapidly developing modality of primary and 
adjuvant anticancer treatment. The main trends today are the search for new 
effective photodynamic agents and the creation of targeted delivery systems with 
the function of controlling the release of the agent in the tumor. Recently, the 
new group of cyanoarylporphyrazine dyes was reported, which combine the 
properties of photosensitizers and sensors of the local microenvironment. Such 
unique characteristics allow the release of the photosensitizer from the 
transport carrier to be assessed in real time in vivo. The aim of the present 
work was to compare the photophysical and photobiological properties of 
tetra(2-naphthyl)tetracyanoporphyrazine and its newly synthesized Fe(II) 
complex. We have shown that the chelation of the Fe(II) cation with the 
porphyrazine macrocycle leads to a decrease in molar extinction and an increase 
in the quantum yield of fluorescence and photostability. We demonstrate that the 
iron cation significantly affects the rate of dye accumulation in cells, the 
dark toxicity and photodynamic activity, and the direction of the changes 
depends on the particular cell line. However, in all the cases, the photodynamic 
index of a metal complex was higher than that of a metal-free base. In general, 
both of the compounds were found to be very promising for PDT, including for the 
use with transport delivery systems, and can be recommended for further in vivo 
studies."
1311,"Selumetinib is administered orally in capsule form and is indicated for the 
treatment of neurofibromatosis. To facilitate dosage adjustments, liquid 
preparations, such as solutions or suspensions, are to be developed. This led, 
first, to determine the stability profile of soluble or dispersed selumetinib 
and, secondly, to look for ways to stabilize the active substance. The 
degradation kinetics of selumetinib as a function of stress conditions were 
determined and compared. The degradation products were detected and identified 
by LC-HRMSn. In solution, selumetinib is sensitive to oxidation and degrades by 
photooxidation. In both cases, the side chain represented by the oxoamide group 
is concerned, leading to the formation of an amide derivative for the first case 
and an ester derivative for the second. The identification of such degradation 
mechanisms allowed us to study, in a targeted way, processes aiming at 
stabilizing the active molecule."
1312,"Protein-based materials intended as nanostructured drugs or drug carriers are 
progressively gaining interest in nanomedicine, since their structure, assembly 
and cellular interactivity can be tailored by recruiting functional domains. The 
main bottleneck in the development of deliverable protein materials is the 
lysosomal degradation that follows endosome maturation. This is especially 
disappointing in the case of receptor-targeted protein constructs, which, while 
being highly promising and in demand in precision medicines, enter cells via 
endosomal/lysosomal routes. In the search for suitable protein agents that might 
promote endosome escape, we have explored the translocation domain (TD) of the 
diphtheria toxin as a functional domain in CXCR4-targeted oligomeric 
nanoparticles designed for cancer therapies. The pharmacological interest of 
such protein materials could be largely enhanced by improving their proteolytic 
stability. The incorporation of TD into the building blocks enhances the amount 
of the material detected inside of exposed CXCR4+ cells up to around 25-fold, in 
absence of cytotoxicity. This rise cannot be accounted for by endosomal escape, 
since the lysosomal degradation of the new construct decreases only moderately. 
On the other hand, a significant loss in the specificity of the CXCR4-dependent 
cellular penetration indicates the unexpected role of the toxin segment as a 
cell-penetrating peptide in a dose-dependent and receptor-independent fashion. 
These data reveal that the diphtheria toxin TD displayed on receptor-targeted 
oligomeric nanoparticles partially abolishes the exquisite receptor specificity 
of the parental material and it induces nonspecific internalization in mammalian 
cells."
1313,"Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies and a leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. The elements of group XIV in the 
periodic table exhibit a wide range of chemical manners. Recently, there have 
been remarkable developments in the field of nanobiomedical research, especially 
in the application of engineered nanomaterials in biomedical applications. In 
this review, we concentrate on the recent investigations on the 
antiproliferative effects of nanomaterials of the elements of group XIV in the 
periodic table on breast cancer cells. In this review, the data available on 
nanomaterials of group XIV for breast cancer treatment has been documented, 
providing a useful insight into tumor biology and nano-bio interactions to 
develop more effective nanotherapeutics for cancer patients."
1314,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline porous materials with periodic 
network structures formed by self-assembly of metal ions and organic ligands. 
Attributed to their tunable composition and pore size, ultrahigh surface area 
(1000-7000 m2/g) and pore volume (1.04-4.40 cm3/g), easy surface modification, 
appropriate physiological stability, etc., MOFs have been widely used in 
biomedical applications in the last two decades, especially for the delivery of 
bioactive agents. In the initial stage, MOFs were widely used to load small 
molecule drugs with ultra-high doses. Whereafter, more recent work has focused 
on the load of biomacromolecules, such as nucleic acids and proteins. Over the 
past years, we have devoted extensive effort to investigate the function of MOF 
materials for bioactive agent delivery. MOFs can be used not only as an 
intelligent nanocarrier to deliver or protect bioactive agents but also as an 
activator for their release or activation in response to the different 
microenvironments. Altogether, this review details the current progress of MOF 
materials for bioactive agent delivery and looks into their future development."
1315,"This study aimed to determine the damage mechanisms caused by naturally targeted 
nanoarchaeosomes made of diether lipids from Halorubrum tebenquichense loaded 
with curcumin (CUR, nATC), which mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) on A549 
cells and on THP-1-macrophages, two cell types found in airway cancers. The 
effect of nATC- PDT on vessels modeled with a chicken embryo chorioallantoic 
membrane (CAM), after dropping the formulations on its surface covered with 
mucins, was also determined. nATCs are known to efficiently trap CUR for at 
least six months, constituting easy-to-prepare, stable formulations suitable for 
nebulization. CUR instead, is easily released from carriers such as liposomes 
made of ordinary phospholipids and cholesterol after a few weeks. Irradiated at 
9 J/cm2, nATC (made of archaeolipids: Tween 80: CUR at 1:0.4:0.04 w:w, size 180 
± 40 nm, ζ potential -24 mV, 150 μg CUR/15 mg lipids/mL) was phototoxic (3.7 ± 
0.5 μM IC50), on A549 cells after 24 h. The irradiation reduced mitochondrial 
membrane potential (ΔΨm), ATP levels and lysosomal functionalism, and caused 
early apoptotic death and late necrosis of A549 cells upon 24 h. nATC induced 
higher extra and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) than free CUR. 
nATC-PDT impaired the migration of A549 cells in a wound healing assay, reduced 
the expression of CD204 in THP-1 macrophages, and induced the highest levels of 
IL-6 and IL-8, suggesting a switch of macrophage phenotype from pro-tumoral M2 
to antitumoral M1. Moreover, nATC reduced the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), 
-2 and -9 secretion, by A549 cells with independence of irradiation. Finally, 
remarkably, upon irradiation at 9 J/cm2 on the superficial vasculature of a CAM 
covered with mucins, nATC caused the vessels to collapse after 8 h, with no harm 
on non-irradiated zones. Overall, these results suggest that nebulized nATC blue 
light-mediated PDT may be selectively deleterious on superficial tumors 
submerged under a thick mucin layer."
1316,"The aim of this study was to obtain solid carvacrol-cyclodextrin (CD) complexes 
for use in the pharmaceutical industry. To this end, the complexation of 
carvacrol at different pH values was studied in detail, to determine the type of 
CD and the reaction environment that supported the highest amount of 
encapsulated carvacrol. Evidence of the capability of 
hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrins (HP-β-CD) to form inclusion complexes with 
carvacrol (KC = 5042 ± 176 L mol-1) and more high complexation efficiency 
(2.824) was demonstrated for HP-β-CDs using two different energy sources, 
ultrasound (US) (KC = 8129 ± 194 L mol-1 24 h) and microwave irradiation (MWI) 
(KC = 6909 ± 161 L mol-1), followed by spraying the resulting solution in a 
spray dryer. To confirm complex formation, the complexes were characterized 
using various instrumental methods to corroborate the carvacrol incorporation 
into the hydrophobic cavity of HP-β-CD. The obtained carvacrol solid complexes 
were analyzed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) and 2D nuclear magnetic 
resonance (ROSEY), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric 
analysis (TG) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 
characterization. The structures of the resulting complexes were also 
characterized by molecular modeling. Furthermore, 1 mM HP-β-CD-carvacrol complex 
has been shown to reduce cell proliferation in HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells 
by 43%, much more than in a healthy lung fibroblast MRC-5 cell line (11%)."
1317,"Nowadays, mesoporous bioactive glasses (MBGs) are envisaged as promising 
candidates in the field of bioceramics for bone tissue regeneration. This is 
ascribed to their singular chemical composition, structural and textural 
properties and easy-to-functionalize surface, giving rise to accelerated 
bioactive responses and capacity for local drug delivery. Since their discovery 
at the beginning of the 21st century, pioneering research efforts focused on the 
design and fabrication of MBGs with optimal compositional, textural and 
structural properties to elicit superior bioactive behavior. The current trends 
conceive MBGs as multitherapy systems for the treatment of bone-related 
pathologies, emphasizing the need of fine-tuning surface functionalization. 
Herein, we focus on the recent developments in MBGs for biomedical applications. 
First, the role of MBGs in the design and fabrication of three-dimensional 
scaffolds that fulfil the highly demanding requirements for bone tissue 
engineering is outlined. The different approaches for developing multifunctional 
MBGs are overviewed, including the incorporation of therapeutic ions in the 
glass composition and the surface functionalization with zwitterionic moieties 
to prevent bacterial adhesion. The bourgeoning scientific literature on MBGs as 
local delivery systems of diverse therapeutic cargoes 
(osteogenic/antiosteoporotic, angiogenic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and 
antitumor agents) is addressed. Finally, the current challenges and future 
directions for the clinical translation of MBGs are discussed."
1318,"Although cancer-therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) is a critical issue 
in clinical practice, there is a glaring lack of evidence regarding 
cardiotoxicity management. To determine an effective and suitable dosage of 
treatment using angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) with 
sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), we adopted a clinically 
relevant rodent model with doxorubicin, which would mimic cardiac dysfunction in 
CTRCD patients. After the oral administration of drugs (vehicle, SGLT2i, ARNI, 
Low-ARNI/SGLT2i, ARNI/SGLT2i), several physiologic parameters, including 
hemodynamic change, cardiac function, and histopathology, were evaluated. Bulk 
RNA-sequencing was performed to obtain insights into the molecular basis of a 
mouse heart response to Low-ARNI/SGLT2i treatment. For the first time, we report 
that the addition of low-dose ARNI with SGLT2i resulted in greater benefits than 
ARNI, SGLT2i alone or ARNI/SGLT2i combination in survival rate, cardiac 
function, hemodynamic change, and kidney function against doxorubicin-induced 
cardiotoxicity through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling 
pathway. Low-dose ARNI with SGLT2i combination treatment would be practically 
beneficial for improving cardiac functions against doxorubicin-induced heart 
failure with minimal adverse effects. Our findings suggest the Low-ARNI/SGLT2i 
combination as a feasible novel strategy in managing CTRCD patients."
1319,"Flibanserin was licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
as an oral non-hormonal therapy for pre-menopausal women with inhibited sexual 
desire disorder. However, it suffers from susceptibility to first-pass 
metabolism in the liver, low aqueous solubility, and degradation in the acidic 
stomach environment. Such hurdles result in a limited oral bioavailability of 
33%. Thus, the aim of the study was to utilize the principles of nanotechnology 
and the benefits of an intranasal route of administration to develop a 
formulation that could bypass these drawbacks. A response-surface randomized 
D-optimal strategy was used for the formulation of flibanserin spanlastics 
(SPLs) with reduced size and increased absolute zeta potential. Two numerical 
factors were studied, namely the Span 60: edge activator ratio (w/w) and 
sonication time (min), in addition to one categorical factor that deals with the 
type of edge activator. Particle size (nm) and zeta potential (mV) were studied 
as responses. A mathematical optimization method was implemented for predicting 
the optimized levels of the variables. The optimized formulation was prepared 
using a Span: sodium deoxycholate ratio of 8:2 w/w; a sonication time of 5 min 
showed particle sizes of 129.70 nm and a zeta potential of -33.17 mV. Further in 
vivo assessment following intranasal administration in rats showed boosted 
plasma and brain levels, with 2.11- and 2.23-fold increases (respectively) 
compared to raw FLB. The aforementioned results imply that the proposed 
spanlastics could be regarded as efficient drug carriers for the trans-nasal 
delivery of drugs to the brain."
1320,"For the delivery of anticancer drugs, an injectable in situ hydrogel with 
thermal responsiveness and prolonged drug release capabilities shows 
considerable potential. Here, we present a series of thermosensitive in situ 
hydrogels that serve as drug delivery systems for the treatment of liver cancer. 
These hydrogels were created by utilizing the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
oligomer, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polypropylene glycol (PPG)'s chemical 
cross-linking capabilities. Doxorubicin (DOX) was encapsulated in a hydrogel 
with a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic shell to enhance DOX solubility. Studies 
into the behavior of in situ produced hydrogels at the microscopic and 
macroscopic levels revealed that the copolymer solution exhibits a progressive 
shift from sol to gel as the temperature rises. The hydrogels' chemical 
composition, thermal properties, rheological characteristics, gelation period, 
and DOX release behavior were all reported. Subcutaneous injection in mice was 
used to confirm the injectability. Through the in vitro release of DOX in a PBS 
solution that mimics the tumor microenvironment, the hydrogel's sustained drug 
release behavior was confirmed. Additionally, using human hepatocellular 
hepatoma, the anticancer efficacy of thermogel (DEP-2@DOX) was assessed (HepG2). 
The carrier polymer material DEP-2 was tested for cytotoxicity using HepG2 cells 
and its excellent cytocompatibility was confirmed. In conclusion, these 
thermally responsive injectable hydrogels are prominent potential candidates as 
drug delivery vehicles for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma."
1321,"Despite the vast amounts of research and remarkable discoveries that have been 
made in recent decades, cancer remains a leading cause of death and a major 
public health concern worldwide. Gossypol, a natural polyphenolic compound 
derived from the seeds, roots, and stems of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), was 
first used as a male contraceptive agent. Due to its diverse biological 
properties, including antifertility, antiviral, antioxidant, antibacterial, 
antimalarial, and most notably antitumor activities, gossypol has been the 
subject of numerous studies. Nevertheless, no systematic review has been 
performed that analyzes the antineoplastic potential of gossypol and related 
natural compounds in an organ-specific manner while delineating the molecular 
mechanisms of action. Hence, we have performed an extensive literature search 
for anticancer properties of gossypol and their natural derivatives against 
various types of cancer cells utilizing PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, 
and Scopus. The sources, distribution, chemical structure, and toxicity of 
gossypol and its constituents are briefly reviewed. Based on emerging evidence, 
gossypol and related compounds exhibit significant antineoplastic effects 
against various cancer types through the modulation of different cancer 
hallmarks and signaling pathways. Additionally, the synergistic activity of 
gossypol and its derivatives with chemotherapeutic agents has been observed. Our 
evaluation of the current literature suggests the potential of gossypol and its 
derivatives as multitargeting drug candidates to combat multiple human 
malignancies."
1322,"A new family of perylenediimide (PDI) silver and copper complexes has been 
successfully synthesized by reacting ortho- and bay-substituted 
(dipyrid-2',2″-ylamino)perylenediimide ligands with metal phosphine fragments. 
The coordination of the metal center did not reveal a significant effect on the 
photophysical properties, which are mainly due to the PDI ligands, and in some 
cases quenching of the luminescence was observed. The antiproliferative effect 
of the free perylenediimide ligands and the metalloPDI complexes against the 
cervix cancer cell line HeLa was determined by MTT assay. The free 
perylenediimide ligands exhibited a moderate cytotoxic activity, but the 
coordination of silver or copper to the dypyridylamino fragment greatly enhanced 
the activity, suggesting a synergistic effect between the two fragments. In 
attempts to elucidate the cellular biodistribution of the PDIs and the 
complexes, a colocalization experiment using specific dyes for the lysosomes or 
mitochondria as internal standards revealed a major internalization inside the 
cell for the metal complexes, as well as a partial mitochondrial localization."
1323,"Cancer is a major threat to the health of humans. Recently, various natural 
products including curcumin (CCM) have attracted enormous interest for 
efficacious cancer therapy. However, natural therapeutic agents still encounter 
certain challenges such as rapid clearance, low bioavailability, and poor tumor 
targeting. Recently, the platelet membrane (PM) camouflaged nanoparticle has 
provided a promising solution for cancer targeting therapy. Nevertheless, only 
limited efforts have been dedicated to systematically explore the mechanism of 
affinity between PM bioinspired nanoparticles and various tumor cells. Herein, a 
CCM-encapsulated platelet membrane biomimetic lipid vesicle (CCM@PL) with a size 
of 163.2 nm, zeta potential of -31.8 mV and encapsulation efficiency of 93.62% 
was developed. The values of the area under the concentration-time curve and 
mean residence time for CCM@PL were 3.08 times and 3.04 times those of CCM, 
respectively. Furthermore, this PM biomimetic carrier showed an excellent 
affinity against Huh-7, SK-OV-3 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines due to the 
biomolecular interaction between P-selectin on the PM and tumoral CD44 
receptors. In addition, CCM@PL displayed enhanced cytotoxicity compared with 
free CCM and the synthetic formulation. Overall, our results suggest that this 
developed PM biomimetic lipid nanovector has great potential for targeted cancer 
treatment and natural components delivery."
1324,"In the generational evolution of nano-based drug delivery carriers, active 
targeting has been a major milestone for improved and selective drug 
accumulation in tissues and cell types beyond the existing passive targeting 
capabilities. Among the various active targeting moieties, chlorotoxin, a 
peptide extracted from scorpions, demonstrated promising tumor cell accumulation 
and selection. With lung cancer being among the leading diagnoses of 
cancer-related deaths in both men and women, novel therapeutic methodologies 
utilizing nanotechnology for drug delivery emerged. Given chlorotoxin's 
promising biological activity, we explore its potential against lung cancer and 
its utilization for active targeting against this cancer's tumor cells. Our 
analysis indicates that despite the extensive chlorotoxin's research against 
glioblastoma, lung cancer research with the molecule has been limited, despite 
some promising early results."
1325,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising add-on therapy to the current standard 
of care for patients with glioblastoma (GBM). The traditional explanation of the 
anti-cancer PDT effects involves the PDT-induced generation of a singlet oxygen 
in the GBM cells, which causes tumor cell death and microvasculature collapse. 
Recently, new vascular mechanisms of PDT associated with opening of the 
blood-brain barrier (OBBB) and the activation of functions of the meningeal 
lymphatic vessels have been discovered. In this review, we highlight the 
emerging trends and future promises of immunotherapy for brain tumors and 
discuss PDT-OBBB as a new niche and an important informative platform for the 
development of innovative pharmacological strategies for the modulation of brain 
tumor immunity and the improvement of immunotherapy for GBM."
1326,"DNA is an excellent programmable polymer for the generation of self-assembled 
multivalent nanostructures useful for biomedical applications. Herein, we 
developed (i) folate-functionalized nanocages (Fol-NC), very efficiently 
internalized by tumor cells overexpressing the α isoform of the folate receptor; 
(ii) AS1411-linked nanocages (Apt-NC), internalized through nucleolin, a protein 
overexpressed in the cell surface of many types of cancers; and (iii) 
nanostructures that harbor both folate and AS1411 aptamer functionalization 
(Fol-Apt-NC). We analyzed the specific miRNA silencing activity of all types of 
nanostructures harboring miRNA sequestering sequences complementary to miR-21 
and the cytotoxic effect when loaded with doxorubicin in a drug-resistant 
triple-negative breast cancer cell line. We demonstrate that the presence of 
folate as a targeting ligand increases the efficiency in miR-21 silencing 
compared to nanocages functionalized with AS1411. Double-functionalized 
nanocages (Fol-Apt-NC), loaded with doxorubicin, resulted in an increase of over 
51% of the cytotoxic effect on MDA-MB-231 cells compared to free doxorubicin, 
demonstrating, besides selectivity, the ability of nanocages to overcome Dox 
chemoresistance. The higher efficiency of the folate-functionalized nanocages is 
due to the way of entrance, which induces more than four times higher 
intracellular stability and indicates that the folate-mediated route of cell 
entry is more efficient than the nucleolin-mediated one when both folate and 
AS1411 modifications are present."
1327,"Immunotherapy has gradually become an emerging treatment modality for tumors 
after surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Cytokine therapy is a promising 
treatment for cancer immunotherapy. Currently, there are many preclinical 
theoretical bases to support this treatment strategy and a variety of cytokines 
in clinical trials. When cytokines were applied to tumor immunotherapy, it was 
found that the efficacy was not satisfactory. As research on tumor immunity has 
deepened, the role of cytokines in the tumor microenvironment has been further 
explored. Meanwhile, the study of nanomaterials in drug delivery has been fully 
developed in the past 20 years. Researchers have begun to think about the 
possibility of combining cytokine therapy with nanomaterials. Herein, we briefly 
review various nano-delivery systems that can directly deliver cytokines or 
regulate the expression of cytokines in tumor cells for cancer immunotherapy. We 
further discussed the feasibility of the combination of various therapies. We 
looked forward to the main challenges, opportunities, and prospects of tumor 
immunotherapy with multiple cytokines and a nano-delivery system."
1328,"Nanoparticles (NPs) are versatile candidates for nanomedical applications due to 
their unique physicochemical properties. However, their clinical applicability 
is hindered by their undesirable recognition by the immune system and the 
consequent immunotoxicity, as well as their rapid clearance in vivo. After 
injection, NPs are usually covered with layers of proteins, called protein 
coronas (PCs), which alter their identity, biodistribution, half-life, and 
efficacy. Therefore, the characterization of the PC is for in predicting the 
fate of NPs in vivo. The aim of this review was to summarize the state of the 
art regarding the intrinsic factors closely related to the NP structure, and 
extrinsic factors that govern PC formation in vitro. In addition, well-known 
opsonins, including complement, immunoglobulins, fibrinogen, and dysopsonins, 
such as histidine-rich glycoprotein, apolipoproteins, and albumin, are described 
in relation to their role in NP detection by immune cells. Particular emphasis 
is placed on their role in mediating the interaction of NPs with innate and 
adaptive immune cells. Finally, strategies to reduce PC formation are discussed 
in detail."
1329,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is a representative anticancer drug with a unique ability to 
induce immunogenic cell death of cancer cells. However, undesired toxicity on 
immune cells has remained a significant challenge, hindering the usage of DOX in 
cancer immunotherapy. Here, we report a combined therapy to avoid the off-target 
toxicity of DOX by adapting ultrasound-responsive liposomal doxorubicin and 
focused ultrasound exposure. Histological analysis demonstrated that the 
combined therapy induced less hemosiderosis of splenocytes and improved tumor 
infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Additionally, in vivo therapeutic 
evaluation results indicate that the combined therapy achieved higher efficacy 
when combined with PD-1 immune-checkpoint blockade therapy by improving 
immunogenicity."
1330,"The objective of this study was to develop a new preparation method for 
cisplatin (CDDP)-incorporated gelatin hydrogels without using chemical 
crosslinking nor a vacuum heating instrument for dehydrothermal crosslinking. By 
simply mixing CDDP and gelatin, CDDP-crosslinked gelatin hydrogels (CCGH) were 
prepared. CDDP functions as a crosslinking agent of gelatin to form the gelatin 
hydrogel. Simultaneously, CDDP is incorporated into the gelatin hydrogel as a 
controlled release carrier. CDDP's in vitro and in vivo anticancer efficacy 
after incorporation into CCGH was evaluated. In the in vitro system, the CDDP 
was released gradually due to CCGH degradation with an initial burst release of 
approximately 16%. CDDP metal-coordinated with the degraded fragment of gelatin 
was released from CCGH with maintaining the anticancer activity. After 
intraperitoneal administration of CCGH, CDDP was detected in the blood 
circulation while its toxicity was low. Following intraperitoneal administration 
of CCGH in a murine peritoneal dissemination model of human gastric cancer 
MKN45-Luc cell line, the survival time was significantly prolonged compared with 
free CDDP solution. It is concluded that CCGH prepared by the CDDP-based 
crosslinking of gelatin is an excellent sustained release system of CDDP to 
achieve superior anticancer effects with minimal side effects compared with free 
CDDP solution."
1331,"Isoform-selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition is promoted as a 
rational strategy to develop safer anti-cancer drugs compared to non-selective 
HDAC inhibitors. Despite this presumed benefit, considerably more non-selective 
HDAC inhibitors have undergone clinical trials. In this report, we detail the 
design and discovery of potent HDAC inhibitors, with 1-benzhydryl piperazine as 
a surface recognition group, that differ in hydrocarbon linker. In vitro HDAC 
screening identified two selective HDAC6 inhibitors with nanomolar IC50 values, 
as well as two non-selective nanomolar HDAC inhibitors. Structure-based 
molecular modeling was employed to study the influence of linker chemistry of 
synthesized inhibitors on HDAC6 potency. The breast cancer cell lines 
(MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) were used to evaluate compound-mediated in vitro 
anti-cancer, anti-migratory, and anti-invasive activities. Experiments on the 
zebrafish MDA-MB-231 xenograft model revealed that a novel non-selective HDAC 
inhibitor with a seven-carbon-atom linker exhibits potent anti-tumor, 
anti-metastatic, and anti-angiogenic effects when tested at low micromolar 
concentrations."
1332,"Bacterial extracellular membrane nanovesicles (EMNs) are attracting the 
attention of scientists more and more every year. These formations are involved 
in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, among which, of course, the leading 
role is occupied by infectious diseases, the causative agents of which are a 
range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. A separate field for the 
study of the role of EMN is cancer. Extracellular membrane nanovesicles nowadays 
have a practical application as vaccine carriers for immunization against many 
infectious diseases. At present, the most essential point is their role in 
stimulating immune response to bacterial infections and tumor cells. The 
possibility of nanovesicles' practical use in several disease treatments is 
being evaluated. In our review, we listed diseases, focusing on their multitude 
and diversity, for which EMNs are essential, and also considered in detail the 
possibilities of using EMNs in the therapy and prevention of various 
pathologies."
1333,"Encorafenib (LGX818, trade name Braftovi), a novel BRAF inhibitor, has been 
approved for the treatment of melanoma and colorectal cancer. In the present 
work, we evaluated encorafenib's possible antagonistic effects on the 
pharmacokinetic mechanisms of multidrug resistance (MDR), as well as its 
perpetrator role in drug interactions. Firstly, encorafenib potently inhibited 
the efflux function of the ABCC1 transporter in drug accumulation assays, while 
moderate and null interaction levels were recorded for ABCB1 and ABCG2, 
respectively. In contrast, the mRNA expression levels of all the tested 
transporters were not altered by encorafenib. In the drug combination studies, 
we found that daunorubicin and topotecan resistances were synergistically 
attenuated by the encorafenib-mediated interaction in A431-ABCC1 cells. Notably, 
further experiments in ex vivo patient-derived explants confirmed the 
MDR-modulating ability of encorafenib. Advantageously, the overexpression of 
tested drug efflux transporters failed to hinder the antiproliferative activity 
of encorafenib. In addition, no significant modulation of the CYP3A4 enzyme's 
activity by encorafenib was observed. In conclusion, our work indicated that 
encorafenib can act as an effective chemosensitizer targeting the ABCC1-induced 
MDR. Our in vitro and ex vivo data might provide valuable information for 
designing the novel effective scheme applicable in the clinical pharmacotherapy 
of BRAF-mutated/ABCC1-expressing tumors."
1334,"The development of stimuli-responsive polymeric micelles for targeted drug 
delivery has attracted much research interest in improving therapeutic outcomes. 
This study designs copolymers responsive to ultraviolet (UV) light and 
glutathione (GSH). A disulfide linkage is positioned between a hydrophilic 
poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (mPEG) and a hydrophobic o-nitrobenzyl 
methacrylate (ONBMA) to yield amphiphilic copolymers termed mPEG-SS-pONBMA. 
Three copolymers with different ONBMA lengths are synthesized and formulated 
into micelles. An increase in particle size and a decrease in critical micelle 
concentration go together with increasing ONBMA lengths. The ONB cleavage from 
mPEG-SS-pONBMA-formed micelles results in the transformation of hydrophobic 
cores into hydrophilic ones, accelerating drug release from the micelles. 
Obvious changes in morphology and molecular weight of micelles upon 
combinational treatments account for the dual-stimuli responsive property. 
Enhancement of a cell-killing effect is clearly observed in doxorubicin 
(DOX)-loaded micelles containing disulfide bonds compared with those containing 
dicarbon bonds upon UV light irradiation. Collectedly, the 
dual-stimuli-responsive mPEG-SS-pONBMA micelle is a better drug delivery carrier 
than the single-stimuli-responsive mPEG-CC-pONBMA micelle. After HT1080 cells 
were treated with the DOX-loaded micelles, the high expression levels of RIP-1 
and MLKL indicate that the mechanism involved in cell death is mainly via the 
DOX-induced necroptosis pathway."
1335,"Cancer cells' resistance to anticancer drugs represents a major clinical problem 
and the most important failure of treatment. Combination chemotherapy is more 
effective than monotherapy due to additive or synergistic effects. The aim of 
our research was to assess the effects of the combinations of apple extract's 
triterpenic compounds, individual triterpenic acids, and doxorubicin (DOX) on 
human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) and human glioblastoma (U-87) cell lines in 
2D and 3D cultures. The effect of the combination of apple extracts, the 
triterpenic standards, and DOX against HT-29 and U-87 cell viability was tested 
by the MTT and spheroid growth assays. Cell line HT-29 was more sensitive to DOX 
when incubated with all tested apple extracts than DOX alone. Cell line HT-29 
was the most strongly sensitive to DOX when it was treated with 5 µM oleanolic 
acid (change of EC50 = -64.6% ± 4.4%) and with 5 µM ursolic acid (change of EC50 
= -61.9% ± 8.8%) in 2D culture. Meanwhile, cell line U-87 was the most strongly 
sensitive to DOX when treated with 2 µM betulinic acid (change of EC50 = -45.1% 
± 4.5%) in 2D culture. The combination of apple extract (E3) and DOX reduced the 
viability of HT-29 spheroids the most (spheroid viability reduced from -19.9% to 
-10.9%, compared to spheroids treated with DOX alone). Our study in 2D and 3D 
cultures showed that combining apple extract's triterpenic complexes or 
individual triterpenic acids with DOX may sensitize chemotherapeutic drugs and 
increase the cytotoxicity effects in HT-29 and U-87 cell lines."
1336,"Designing new metallodrugs for anticancer therapy is a driving force in the 
scientific community. Aiming to contribute to this field, we hereby report the 
development of a Schiff base (H2L) derived from the condensation of 
2-carbaldehyde-8-hydroxyquinoline with 2-hydrazinobenzothiazole and its 
complexation with transition metal ions. All compounds were characterised by 
analytical and spectroscopic techniques, which disclosed their structure: 
[Cu(HL)Cl], [Cu(HL)2], [Ni(HL)(acetate)], [Ni(HL)2], [Ru(HL)Cl(DMSO)], [VO(HL)2] 
and [Fe(HL)2Cl(H2O)]. Different binding modes were proposed, showing the 
ligand's coordination versatility. The ligand proton dissociation constants were 
determined, and the tested compounds showed high lipophilicity and light 
sensitivity. The stability of all complexes in aqueous media and their ability 
to bind to albumin were screened. Based on an antiproliferative in vitro 
screening, [Ni(HL)(acetate)] and [Ru(HL)Cl(DMSO)] were selected for further 
studies aiming to investigate their mechanisms of action and therapeutic 
potential towards colon cancer. The complexes displayed IC50 &lt; 21 μM towards 
murine (CT-26) and human (HCT-116) colon cancer cell lines. Importantly, both 
complexes exhibited superior antiproliferative properties compared to the 
clinically approved 5-fluorouracil. [Ni(HL)(acetate)] induced cell cycle arrest 
in S phase in CT-26 cells. For [Ru(HL)Cl(DMSO)] this effect was observed in both 
colon cancer cell lines. Additionally, both compounds significantly inhibited 
cell migration particularly in the human colon cancer cell line, HCT-116. 
Overall, the therapeutic potential of both metal complexes was demonstrated."
1337,"Hepatocellular carcinoma is the seventh most common type of cancer in the world, 
with limited treatment options. A promising strategy to treat cancer is to 
associate chemotherapeutics and plant bioactive compounds. Here, we examined 
whether diallyl disulfide (DADS; 50-200 μM) and sorafenib (SORA; 8 μM), either 
alone or in combination, were toxic to hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) in 
vitro. We assessed whether DADS and/or SORA induced cell death (LIVE/DEAD assay 
and autophagy) and cell cycle changes (flow cytometry), altered expression of 
key genes and proteins (RT-qPCR and Western blot), and modulated tumorigenesis 
signatures, such as proliferation (clonogenic assay), migration (wound healing), 
and invasion (inserts). The DADS + SORA combination elicited autophagic cell 
death by upregulating LC3 and NRF2 expression and downregulating FOS and TNF 
expression; induced the accumulation of cells in the G1 phase which thereby 
upregulated the CHEK2 expression; and inhibited invasion by downregulating the 
MMP2 expression. Predictive analysis indicated the participation of the MAPK 
pathway in the reported results. The DADS + SORA combination suppressed both 
cell invasion and clonogenic survival, which indicated that it dampened tumor 
growth, proliferation, invasion, and metastatic potential. Therefore, the DADS + 
SORA combination is a promising therapy to develop new clinical protocols."
1338,"Essential oils' therapeutic potential is highly recognized, with many 
applications rising due to reported anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, 
neuroprotective, anti-aging, and anti-cancer effects. Nevertheless, clinical 
translation still remains a challenge, mainly due to essential oils' volatility 
and low water solubility and stability. The present review gathers relevant 
information and postulates on the potential application of plant nanovesicles to 
effectively deliver essential oils to target organs. Indeed, plant nanovesicles 
are emerging as alternatives to mammalian vesicles and synthetic carriers due to 
their safety, stability, non-toxicity, and low immunogenicity. Moreover, they 
can be produced on a large scale from various plant parts, enabling an easier, 
more rapid, and less costly industrial application that could add value to waste 
products and boost the circular economy. Importantly, the use of plant 
nanovesicles as delivery platforms could increase essential oils' 
bioavailability and improve chemical stability while reducing volatility and 
toxicity issues. Additionally, using targeting strategies, essential oils' 
selectivity, drug delivery, and efficacy could be improved, ultimately leading 
to dose reduction and patient compliance. Bearing this in mind, information on 
current pharmaceutical technologies available to enable distinct routes of 
administration of loaded vesicles is also discussed."
1339,"The discovery and improvements of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have become an 
alternative to conventional antibiotics. They are usually small and heat-stable 
peptides, exhibiting inhibitory activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive 
bacteria. In this way, studies on broad-spectrum AMPs found in amphibians with 
the remarkable capability to regenerate a wide array of tissues are of 
particular interest in the search for new strategies to treat 
multidrug-resistant bacterial strains. In this work, the use of bioinformatic 
approaches such as sequence alignment with Fasta36 and prediction of 
antimicrobial activity allowed the identification of the Ramosin peptide from 
the de novo assembled transcriptome of the plethodontid salamander Bolitoglossa 
ramosi obtained from post-amputation of the upper limb tissue, heart, and 
intestine samples. BLAST analysis revealed that the Ramosin peptide sequence is 
unique in Bolitoglossa ramosi. The peptide was chemically synthesized, and 
physicochemical properties were characterized. Furthermore, the in vitro 
antimicrobial activity against relevant Gram-positive and Gram-negative human 
pathogenic bacteria was demonstrated. Finally, no effect against eukaryotic 
cells or human red blood cells was evidenced. This is the first antibacterial 
peptide identified from a Colombian endemic salamander with interesting 
antimicrobial properties and no hemolytic activity."
1340,"Due to the simple one-step preparation method and a promising application in 
biomedical research, amphiphilic gradient copoly(2-oxazoline)s are gaining more 
and more interest compared to their analogous block copolymers. In this work, 
the curcumin solubilization ability was tested for a series of amphiphilic 
gradient copoly(2-oxazoline)s with different lengths of hydrophobic side-chains, 
consisting of 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline as a hydrophilic monomer and 
2-(4-alkyloxyphenyl)-2-oxazoline as a hydrophobic monomer. It is shown that the 
length of the hydrophobic side-chain in the copolymers plays a crucial role in 
the loading of curcumin onto the self-assembled nanoparticles. The kinetic 
stability of self-assembled nanoparticles studied using FRET shows a link 
between their integrity and cellular uptake in human glioblastoma cells. The 
present study demonstrates how minor changes in the molecular structure of 
gradient copoly(2-oxazoline)s can lead to significant differences in the 
loading, stability, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and pharmacokinetics of 
nano-formulations containing curcumin. The obtained results on the behavior of 
the complex of gradient copoly(2-oxazoline)s and curcumin may contribute to the 
development of effective next-generation polymeric nanostructures for biomedical 
applications."
1341,"This study systematically reviews and characterizes the existing literature on 
transferrin/transferrin receptor-mediated drug delivery. Transferrin is an 
iron-binding protein. It can be used as a ligand to deliver various proteins, 
genes, ions, and drugs to the target site via transferrin receptors for 
therapeutic or diagnostic purposes via transferrin receptors. This study is 
based on a cross-sectional bibliometric analysis of 583 papers limited to the 
subject areas of pharmacology, toxicology, and pharmaceutics as extracted from 
the Scopus database in mid-September 2022. The data were analyzed, and we 
carried out a performance analysis and science mapping. There was a significant 
increase in research from 2018 onward. The countries that contributed the most 
were the USA and China, and most of the existing research was found to be from 
single-country publications. Research studies on transferrin/transferrin 
receptor-mediated drug delivery focus on drug delivery across the blood-brain 
barrier in the form of nanoparticles. The thematic analysis revealed four 
themes: transferrin/transferrin receptor-mediated drug delivery to the brain, 
cancer cells, gene therapy, nanoparticles, and liposomes as drug delivery 
systems. This study is relevant to academics, practitioners, and decision makers 
interested in targeted and site-specific drug delivery."
1342,"The topical use of imiquimod (IMQ), a non-specific immune response modifier, 
showed to be a promising therapeutic option for the early-stage treatment of 
some type of oral cancer, even when performed with a formulation (Aldara®) 
developed and approved for skin application. The aim of this work was the 
development of buccal formulations for the topical administration of IMQ with 
improved mucosal retention and reduced trans-mucosal permeation when compared to 
the reference formulation. Three different hydrogels based on carboxymethyl 
chitosan (CMChit), sodium alginate (A), and xanthan gum (X) in different 
combinations were prepared, and the loading of imiquimod was successfully 
performed by using a micellar formulation based on d-α-tocopheril polyethylene 
glycol 100 succinate (TPGS). Except for CMChit formulation, in all the other 
cases, the performance in vitro on the mucosa resulted comparable to the 
commercial formulation, despite the drug loading being 50-fold lower. Converting 
the gels in films did not modify the IMQ accumulated with respect to the 
correspondent gel formulation but produced as a positive effect a significant 
reduction in the amount permeated. Compared to the commercial formulation, this 
reduction was significant (p &lt; 0.01) in the case of X film, resulting in an 
improvement of the retained/permeated ratio from 1 to 5.44. Mucoadhesion 
evaluation showed similar behavior when comparing the developed gels and the 
commercial formulation, and an excellent bioadhesion was observed for the films."
1343,"The restoration of the efficacy of antitumor medicines is a cornerstone in the 
combat with multidrug resistant (MDR) cancers. The overexpression of the ABCB1 
transporter is a major obstacle to conventional doxorubicin therapy. The synergy 
of ABCB1 suppression and PARP1 activity inhibition that hampers malignant cell 
DNA repair could be a powerful tool in anticancer therapy. Herein, we report the 
design and synthesis of three novel olaparib conjugates with 
selenophenoquinolinones, their ability to reverse doxorubicin resistance in 
uterus sarcoma cells as well as their mechanism of action. It was found that the 
most potent chemosensitizer among studied compounds preserves PARP1 inhibitory 
activity and attenuates cells' resistance to doxorubicin by inhibiting ABCB1 
transporter activity. These results demonstrate that the conjugation of PARP 
inhibitors with selenophenoquinolinones is a prospective direction for the 
development of agents for the treatment of MDR cancers."
1344,"Several gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) antagonists with improved in 
vivo behavior have been recently developed and tested in the clinic. However, 
despite the generally mild side effects of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy 
(PRRT), toxicity has been observed due to high doses delivered to nontarget 
tissues, especially in the kidneys and pancreas. Previous experiences with 
radiolabeled peptides opened a unique opportunity to explore GRPR pretargeting 
using clickable bombesin antagonists. Toward this goal, we used clickable 
DOTA-like radiocomplexes which have been previously evaluated by our group. We 
functionalized a potent GRPR antagonist with a clickable TCO moiety using two 
different linkers. These precursors were then studied to select the compound 
with the highest GRPR binding affinity and the best pharmacokinetics to finally 
explore the advantages of the devised pretargeting approach. Our results 
provided an important proof of concept toward the development of bioorthogonal 
approaches to GRPR-expressing cancers, which are worth investigating further to 
improve the in vivo results. Moreover, the use of clickable GRPR antagonists and 
DOTA/DOTAGA derivatives allows for fine-tuning of their pharmacokinetics and 
metabolic stability, leading to a versatile synthesis of new libraries of 
(radio)conjugates useful for the development of theranostic tools toward 
GRPR-expressing tumors."
1345,"Undesirable side effects and multidrug tolerance are the main holdbacks to the 
treatment of cancer in conventional chemotherapy. Fortunately, targeted drug 
delivery can improve the enrichment of drugs at the target site and reduce 
toxicity to normal tissues and cells. A targeted drug delivery system is usually 
composed of a nanocarrier and a targeting component. The targeting component is 
called a ""ligand"". Aptamers have high target affinity and specificity, which are 
identified as attractive and promising ligands. Therefore, aptamers have 
potential application in the development of smart targeting systems. For 
instance, aptamers are able to efficiently recognize tumor markers such as 
nucleolin, mucin, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Besides, aptamers 
can also identify glycoproteins on the surface of tumor cells. Thus, the 
aptamer-mediated targeted drug delivery system has received extensive attention 
in the application of cancer therapy. This article reviews the application of 
aptamers as smart ligands for targeted drug delivery in cancer therapy. Special 
interest is focused on aptamers as smart ligands, aptamer-conjugated 
nanocarriers, aptamer targeting strategy for tumor microenvironment (TME), and 
aptamers that are specified to crucial cancer biomarkers for targeted drug 
delivery."
1346,"Human chromogranin A (CgA), a 439 residue-long member of the ""granin"" secretory 
protein family, is the precursor of several peptides and polypeptides involved 
in the regulation of the innate immunity, cardiovascular system, metabolism, 
angiogenesis, tissue repair, and tumor growth. Despite the many biological 
activities observed in experimental and preclinical models for CgA and its most 
investigated fragments (vasostatin-I and catestatin), limited information is 
available on the receptor mechanisms underlying these effects. The interaction 
of vasostatin-1 with membrane phospholipids and the binding of catestatin to 
nicotinic and b2-adrenergic receptors have been proposed as important mechanisms 
for some of their effects on the cardiovascular and sympathoadrenal systems. 
Recent studies have shown that neuropilin-1 and certain integrins may also work 
as high-affinity receptors for CgA, vasostatin-1 and other fragments. In this 
case, we review the results of these studies and discuss the structural 
requirements for the interactions of CgA-related peptides with neuropilin-1 and 
integrins, their biological effects, their mechanisms, and the potential 
exploitation of compounds that target these ligand-receptor systems for cancer 
diagnosis and therapy. The results obtained so far suggest that integrins 
(particularly the integrin avb6) and neuropilin-1 are important receptors that 
mediate relevant pathophysiological functions of CgA and CgA fragments in 
angiogenesis, wound healing, and tumor growth, and that these interactions may 
represent important targets for cancer imaging and therapy."
1347,"Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), initially utilized in the 
treatment of malaria, have now developed a long list of applications. Despite 
their clinical relevance, their mechanisms of action are not clearly defined. 
Major pathways by which these agents are proposed to function include 
alkalinization of lysosomes and endosomes, downregulation of C-X-C chemokine 
receptor type 4 (CXCR4) expression, high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) 
inhibition, alteration of intracellular calcium, and prevention of thrombus 
formation. However, there is conflicting data present in the literature. This is 
likely the result of the complex overlapping pathways between these mechanisms 
of action that have not previously been highlighted. In fact, prior research has 
focused on very specific portions of particular pathways without describing 
these in the context of the extensive CQ/HCQ literature. This review summarizes 
the detailed data regarding CQ/HCQ's mechanisms of action while also providing 
insight into the overarching themes. Furthermore, this review provides clinical 
context to the application of these diverse drugs including their role in 
malaria, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, thrombus formation, 
malignancies, and viral infections."
1348,"Malignant melanoma is the most fatal form of skin cancer worldwide, and earlier 
diagnosis and more effective therapies are required to improve prognosis. As a 
possible solution, near-infrared fluorescent heptamethine cyanine dyes have been 
shown to be useful for tumor diagnosis and treatment. Here, we synthesized a 
novel theranostic agent, IR-817, a multifunctional bioactive small-molecule that 
has near-infrared emission, targets mitochondria in cancer cells, and has 
selective anti-cancer effects. In in vitro experiments, IR-817 preferentially 
accumulated in melanoma cells through organic anion transporting polypeptide 
transporters but also selectively inhibited the growth of tumor cells by 
inducing mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic apoptosis. Mechanistically, IR-817 
caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by targeting the E2F/Cyclin/CDK pathway. Finally, 
IR-817 significantly suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors in zebrafish and 
mice. Immunohistochemical staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed 
that IR-817 induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor cell proliferation without 
notable side effects. Therefore, mitochondrial-targeting theranostic agent 
IR-817 may be promising for accurate tumor diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and 
safe anti-cancer treatments."
1349,"Andrographolide (Andro), the major constituent of Andrographis paniculata Nees 
(Acanthaceae), is was known to reduces inflammatory reaction. In the current 
study, the ability of Andro to reduce pain sensation in a rat post-operative 
wound model was explored. The hind paws of 18 Sprague-Dawley rats (SD) bearing 
post-operative wounds received the following three treatments: Saline, Andro via 
direct injection into the paw (Andro-injected) and Tablet containing Andro + 
poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) (Andro-tablet). Von Frey tests assessed 
mechanical allodynia at 1, 3, 5 h and 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-days post-operation. 
Behavioral analyses were performed to measure reaction threshold and reaction 
frequencies. Immunoreactivity of p-ERK and GluR1 was examined in the dorsal horn 
of the spinal cord. Histopathological and immunostaining studies were conducted 
on paw epidermis to observe the gross morphology and angiogenesis. The threshold 
for inducing allodynia increased and the reaction frequency reduced in the 
Andro-injected group compared to the saline-group, at 3 h post-surgery and the 
effect lasted between 3-4 days. The threshold for inducing pain and reaction 
frequency for the Andro-tablet group did not differ from the saline-treated 
group. The levels of p-ERK and GluR1 in the dorsal horn were reduced after Andro 
treatment. No significant difference in wound healing index was observed between 
saline and Andro-injected groups, but CD-31 staining showed less angiogenesis in 
the Andro-injected group. Andro significantly reduced mechanical allodynia 
compared to saline treatment, both in shorter and longer time frames. 
Furthermore, Andro influenced the expression of p-ERK and GluR1 in the dorsal 
horn, and the angiogenesis process in the wound healing area."
1350,"Kaempferol, a natural flavonoid abundantly found in plants, is known to have 
pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. 
In this study, we investigated the antiviral effects of kaempferol against a 
varicella-zoster virus (VZV) clinical isolate in vitro. We found that kaempferol 
significantly inhibited VZV replication without exhibiting cytotoxicity. 
Kaempferol exerted its antiviral effect at a similar stage of the VZV life cycle 
as acyclovir, which inhibits VZV DNA replication. Taken together, our results 
suggest that kaempferol inhibits VZV infection by blocking the DNA replication 
stage in the viral life cycle."
1351,"Searching for bioactive compounds within the huge chemical space is like trying 
to find a needle in a haystack. Isatin is a unique natural compound which is 
endowed with different bio-pertinent activities, especially in cancer therapy. 
Herein, we envisaged that adopting a hybrid strategy of isatin and 
α,β-unsaturated ketone would afford new chemical entities with strong 
chemotherapeutic potential. Of interest, compounds 5b and 5g demonstrated 
significant antiproliferative activities against different cancer genotypes 
according to NCI-60 screening. Concomitantly, their IC50 against HL-60 cells 
were 0.38 ± 0.08 and 0.57 ± 0.05 µM, respectively, demonstrating remarkable 
apoptosis and moderate cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Intriguingly, an 
impressive safety profile for 5b was reflected by a 37.2 times selectivity 
against HL-60 over PBMC from a healthy donor. This provoked us to further 
explore their mechanism of action by in vitro and in silico tools. Conclusively, 
5b and 5g stand out as strong chemotherapeutic agents that hold clinical promise 
against acute myeloid leukemia."
1352,"Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs) block estrogen production and improve survival in 
patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. However, half of patients 
develop aromatase-inhibitor-induced arthralgia (AIIA), which is characterized by 
inflammation of the joints and the surrounding musculoskeletal tissue. To create 
a platform for future interventional strategies, our objective was to 
characterize a novel animal model of AIIA. Female BALB/C-Tg(NFκB-RE-luc)-Xen 
mice, which have a firefly luciferase NFκB reporter gene, were oophorectomized 
and treated with an AI (letrozole). Bioluminescent imaging showed significantly 
enhanced NFκB activation with AI treatment in the hind limbs. Moreover, an 
analysis of the knee joints and legs via MRI showed enhanced signal detection in 
the joint space and the surrounding tissue. Surprisingly, the responses observed 
with AI treatment were independent of oophorectomy, indicating that inflammation 
is not mediated by physiological estrogen levels. Histopathological and 
pro-inflammatory cytokine analyses further demonstrated the same trend, as 
tenosynovitis and musculoskeletal infiltrates were detected in all mice 
receiving AI, and serum cytokines were significantly upregulated. Human PBMCs 
treated with letrozole/estrogen combinations did not demonstrate an AI-specific 
gene expression pattern, suggesting AIIA-mediated pathogenesis through other 
cell types. Collectively, these data identify an AI-induced stimulation of 
disease pathology and suggest that AIIA pathogenesis may not be mediated by 
estrogen deficiency, as previously hypothesized."
1353,"The anticancer effects and mechanisms of marine sponge Aaptos suberitoides were 
rarely assessed, especially for methanol extract of A. suberitoides (MEAS) to 
breast cancer cells. This study evaluated the differential suppression effects 
of proliferation by MEAS between breast cancer and normal cells. MEAS 
demonstrated more antiproliferation impact on breast cancer cells than normal 
cells, indicating oxidative stress-dependent preferential antiproliferation 
effects on breast cancer cells but not for normal cells. Several oxidative 
stress-associated responses were highly induced by MEAS in breast cancer cells 
but not normal cells, including the generations of cellular and mitochondrial 
oxidative stress as well as the depletion of mitochondrial membrane potential. 
MEAS downregulated cellular antioxidants such as glutathione, partly 
contributing to the upregulation of oxidative stress in breast cancer cells. 
This preferential oxidative stress generation is accompanied by more DNA damage 
(γH2AX and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine) in breast cancer cells than in normal 
cells. N-acetylcysteine reverted these MEAS-triggered responses. In conclusion, 
MEAS is a potential natural product for treating breast cancer cells with the 
characteristics of preferential antiproliferation function without cytotoxicity 
to normal cells in vitro."
1354,"Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of 
non-small-cell lung cancer, but it is inefficient on brain metastases. 
Crizotinib is a substrate of the P-glycoprotein, and non-invasive nuclear 
imaging can be used to assess the brain penetration of crizotinib. Positron 
emission tomography (PET) imaging using fluorine-18-labeled crizotinib would be 
a powerful tool for investigating new strategies to enhance the brain 
distribution of crizotinib. We have synthesized a spirocyclic hypervalent iodine 
precursor for the isotopic labeling of crizotinib in a 2.4% yield. Because 
crizotinib is an enantiomerically pure drug, a chiral separation was performed 
to afford the (R)-precursor. A two-step radiolabeling process was optimized and 
automated using the racemic precursor to afford [18F](R,S)-crizotinib in 15 ± 2 
radiochemical yield and 103 ± 18 GBq/µmol molar activity. The same radiolabeling 
process was applied to the (R)-precursor to afford [18F](R)-crizotinib with 
comparable results. As a proof-of-concept, PET was realized in a single 
non-human primate to demonstrate the feasibility of [18F](R)-crizotinib in in 
vivo imaging. Whole-body PET highlighted the elimination routes of crizotinib 
with negligible penetration in the brain (SUVmean = 0.1). This proof-of-concept 
paves the way for further studies using [18F](R)-crizotinib to enhance its brain 
penetration depending on the P-glycoprotein function."
1355,"The sigma-2 receptor/transmembrane protein 97 (σ2R/TMRM97) is a promising 
biomarker of tumor proliferation and a target for cancer therapy. [3H]DTG has 
been used to evaluate σ2R/TMEM97 binding affinity in compound development 
studies. However, [3H]DTG has equal and moderate binding affinities to both 
sigma 1 receptor (σ1R) and σ2R/TMEM97. Furthermore, co-administration with the 
σ1R masking compound (+)-pentazocine may cause bias in σ2R/TMEM97 binding 
affinity screening experiments. We have developed a radioiodinated ligand, 
[125I]RHM-4, which has high affinity and selectivity for σ2R/TMEM97 versus σ1R. 
In this study, a head-to-head comparison between [3H]DTG and [125I]RHM-4 on the 
binding affinity and their effectiveness in σ2R/TMEM97 compound screening 
studies was performed. The goal of these studies was to determine if this 
radioiodinated ligand is a suitable replacement for [3H]DTG for screening new 
σ2R/TMEM97 compounds. Furthermore, to delineate the binding properties of 
[125I]RHM-4 to the σ2R/TMEM97, the structure of RHM-4 was split into two 
fragments. This resulted in the identification of two binding regions in the 
σ2R, the ""DTG"" binding site, which is responsible for binding to the σ2R/TMEM97, 
and the secondary binding site, which is responsible for high affinity and 
selectivity for the σ2R/TMEM97 versus the σ1R. The results of this study 
indicate that [125I]RHM-4 is an improved radioligand for in vitro binding 
studies of the σ2R/TMEM97 versus [3H]DTG."
1356,"Cancer chemotherapy is known to cause cognitive defects in patients. Our study 
investigated the effect of piracetam (PIRA; 200 or 400 mg/kg) against 
doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cognitive deficits in a rat model. The cognitive 
parameters were analyzed using elevated plus-maze, novel object recognition, and 
Y-maze tests. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), neuroinflammatory mediators 
(cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)), apoptotic proteins (B-cell lymphoma-2 
(Bcl-2), Bcl2 associated X protein (Bax), cysteine aspartate specific protease-3 
(caspase-3)), oxidative parameters (malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and 
glutathione (GSH)) were also determined in the brain. PIRA administration 
offered significant protection against DOX-induced cognitive deficits in all 
maze tests and restored cholinergic functions via a significant reduction in 
AChE levels. Additionally, PIRA suppressed DOX-induced neuroinflammatory 
mediators (COX-2, PGE2, NF-κB, and TNF-α), pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and 
caspase-3), and oxidative stress (MDA). Besides, it facilitated antioxidant (CAT 
and GSH) levels. Hence, our study highlighted that the neuroprotective activity 
of PIRA against DOX-induced cognitive deficits can be linked to reductions of 
AChE levels, neuro-inflammatory mediators, pro-apoptotic proteins, and oxidative 
stress."
1357,"Lung cancer and cutaneous leishmaniasis are critical diseases with a relatively 
higher incidence in developing countries. In this research, the activity of 
Carissa macrocarpa leaf hydromethanolic extract and its solvent-fractions 
(n-hexane, EtOAc, n-butanol, and MeOH) against the lung adenocarcinoma cell line 
(A549) and Leishmania major was investigated. The MeOH fraction exhibited higher 
cytotoxic activity (IC50 1.57 ± 0.04 μg/mL) than the standard drug, etoposide 
(IC50 50.8 ± 3.16 μg/mL). The anti-L. major results revealed strong growth 
inhibitory effects of the EtOAc fraction against L. major promastigotes (IC50 
27.52 ± 0.7 μg/mL) and axenic amastigotes (29.33 ± 4.86% growth inhibition at 
100 μg/mL), while the butanol fraction exerted moderate activity against 
promastigotes (IC50 73.17 ± 1.62), as compared with miltefosine against 
promastigotes (IC50 6.39 ± 0.29 μg/mL) and sodium stibogluconate against axenic 
amastigotes (IC50 22.45 ± 2.22 μg/mL). A total of 102 compounds were tentatively 
identified using UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of the total extract and its fractions. 
The MeOH fraction was found to contain several flavonoids and flavan-3-ol 
derivatives with known cytotoxic properties, whereas the EtOAc fractions 
contained triterpene, hydroxycinnamoyl, sterol, and flavanol derivatives with 
known antileishmanial activity. Molecular docking of various polyphenolics of 
the MeOH fraction with HDAC6 and PDK3 enzymes demonstrates high binding affinity 
of the epicatechin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and catechin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside 
toward HDAC6, and procyanidin C2, procyanidin B5 toward PDK3. These results are 
promising and encourage the pursuit of preclinical research using C. 
macrocarpa's MeOH fraction as anti-lung cancer and the EtOAc fraction as an 
anti-L. major drug candidates."
1358,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a malignancy accounting for only 3% of total cancers, 
but with a low 5-year relative survival rate. Approximately 80% of PC patients 
are diagnosed at a late stage when the disease has already spread from the 
primary site. Despite advances in PC treatment, there is an urgently needed for 
the identification of novel therapeutic strategies for PC, particularly for 
patients who cannot undergo classical surgery. Autophagy is an evolutionarily 
conserved process used by cells to adapt to metabolic stress via the degrading 
or recycling of damaged or unnecessary organelles and cellular components. This 
process is elevated in PC and, thus, it contributes to the onset, progression, 
and cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy in pancreatic tumors. Autophagy 
inhibition has been shown to lead to cancer regression and to increase the 
sensitivity of pancreatic cells to radiation and chemotherapy. Emerging studies 
have focused on the roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as miRNAs, long 
non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs, in PC development and progression. 
Furthermore, ncRNAs have been reported as crucial regulators of many biological 
processes, including autophagy, suggesting that ncRNA-based autophagy targeting 
methods could be promising novel molecular approaches for specifically reducing 
autophagic flux, thus improving the management of PC patients. In this review, 
we briefly summarize the existing studies regarding the role and the regulatory 
mechanisms of autophagy-related ncRNAs in the context of this cancer."
1359,"Cancers and neurological disorders are two major types of diseases. We 
previously developed a new concept termed ""Aberrant Cell Cycle Diseases"" (ACCD), 
revealing that these two diseases share a common mechanism of aberrant cell 
cycle re-entry. The aberrant cell cycle re-entry is manifested as 
kinase/oncogene activation and tumor suppressor inactivation, which are 
hallmarks of both tumor growth in cancers and neuronal death in neurological 
disorders. Therefore, some cancer therapies (e.g., kinase inhibition, tumor 
suppressor elevation) can be leveraged for neurological treatments. The United 
States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has so far approved 74 kinase 
inhibitors, with numerous other kinase inhibitors in clinical trials, mostly for 
the treatment of cancers. In contrast, there are dire unmet needs of 
FDA-approved drugs for neurological treatments, such as Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), ischemic stroke (IS), traumatic brain 
injury (TBI), and others. In this review, we list these 74 FDA-approved 
kinase-targeted drugs and identify those that have been reported in preclinical 
and/or clinical trials for neurological disorders, with a purpose of discussing 
the feasibility and applicability of leveraging these cancer drugs (FDA-approved 
kinase inhibitors) for neurological treatments."
1360,"Polyphenol, one of the major components that exert the therapeutic effect of 
Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), comprises several categories, including 
flavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans and stilbenes, and has long been studied in 
oncology due to its significant efficacy against cancers in vitro and in vivo. 
Recent evidence has linked this antitumor activity to the role of polyphenols in 
the modulation of redox homeostasis (e.g., pro/antioxidative effect) in cancer 
cells. Dysregulation of redox homeostasis could lead to the overproduction of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in oxidative stress, which is essential 
for many aspects of tumors, such as tumorigenesis, progression, and drug 
resistance. Thus, investigating the ROS-mediated anticancer properties of 
polyphenols is beneficial for the discovery and development of novel 
pharmacologic agents. In this review, we summarized these extensively studied 
polyphenols and discussed the regulatory mechanisms related to the modulation of 
redox homeostasis that are involved in their antitumor property. In addition, we 
discussed novel technologies and strategies that could promote the development 
of CHM-derived polyphenols to improve their versatile anticancer properties, 
including the development of novel delivery systems, chemical modification, and 
combination with other agents."
1361,"Isoorientin (ISO) is a flavonoid compound containing a luteolin structure, which 
can induce autophagy in some tumor cells. This study investigated the impact of 
ISO in gastric cancer AGS cells, and performed an experimental analysis on the 
main signaling pathways and transduction pathways it regulates. CCK-8 assay 
results showed that ISO reduced the survival rate of gastric cancer AGS cells, 
but the toxicity to normal cells was minimal. Hoechst 33342/PI double staining 
assay results showed that ISO induced apoptosis in gastric cancer AGS cells. 
Further analysis by flow cytometry and Western blot showed that ISO induced 
apoptosis via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. In addition, the level of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in gastric cancer AGS cells also increased with 
the extension of the ISO treatment time. However, cell apoptosis was inhibited 
by preconditioning cells with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Moreover, ISO arrested the 
cell cycle at the G2/M phase by increasing intracellular ROS levels. Cell 
migration assay results showed that ISO inhibited cell migration by inhibiting 
the expression of p-AKT, p-GSK-3β, and β-catenin and was also related to the 
accumulation of ROS. These results suggest that ISO-induced cell apoptosis by 
ROS-mediated MAPK/STAT3/NF-κB signaling pathways inhibited cell migration by 
regulating the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway in gastric cancer AGS 
cells."
1362,"Viral hepatitis has long been underrated as a danger to global health. The UN 
only recently called for worldwide action to tackle viral hepatitis and lessen 
the disease burden in its ""2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development"". Hepatitis B 
virus (HBV), which causes liver cirrhosis and malignancy, is a main cause of 
death globally. This review analyses innovative HBV therapeutic vaccine 
candidates for which a patent was filed between January 2010 and March 2022 and 
presents future improvement techniques for vaccine efficacy. Although there is a 
preventative vaccine for HBV infection, over 3% of people worldwide have the 
disease on a long-term basis and can no longer benefit from it. Most people will 
have chronic HBV infection for the rest of their lives once it has been 
diagnosed. Moreover, only a small percentage of treated patients experience a 
functional cure with persistent hepatitis B surface antigen reduction. A 
significant proportion of deaths are caused by liver cirrhosis and 
hepatocellular cancer, which are both caused by chronic hepatitis B infection. 
Hence, there is an urgent need for novel medications due to the inadequacies of 
the current therapies."
1363,"The association between cancer and a hypercoagulatory environment is well 
described. Thrombotic complications serve not only as a major mortality risk but 
the underlying molecular structure and function play significant roles in 
enhancing tumour progression, which is defined as the tumour's capacity to 
survive, invade and metastasise, amongst other hallmarks of the disease. The use 
of anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs in cardiovascular disease lessens 
thrombotic effects, but the consequences on tumour progression require 
interrogation. Therefore, this review considered developments in the management 
of platelet activation pathways (thromboxane, ADP and thrombin), focusing on the 
use of Aspirin, Clopidogrel and Atopaxar, and their potential impacts on tumour 
progression. Published data suggested a cautionary tale in ensuring we 
adequately investigate not only drug-drug interactions but also those unforeseen 
reciprocal interactions between drugs and their targets within the tumour 
microenvironment that may act as selective pressures, enhancing tumour survival 
and progression."
1364,"Clinical trials have shown the significant efficacy of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 for 
treating prostate cancer. However, the pharmacokinetic characteristics and 
therapeutic performance of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 still need further improvement to 
meet clinical expectations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
feasibility and therapeutic potential of three novel 177Lu-labeled ligands for 
the treatment of prostate cancer. The novel ligands were efficiently synthesized 
and radiolabeled with non-carrier added 177Lu; the radiochemical purity of the 
final products was determined by Radio-HPLC. The specific cell-binding affinity 
to PSMA was evaluated in vitro using prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1and PC-3. 
Blood pharmacokinetic analysis, biodistribution experiments, small animal SPCET 
imaging and treatment experiments were performed on normal and tumor-bearing 
mice. Among all the novel ligands developed in this study, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-Q 
showed the highest uptake in 22Rv1 cells, while there was almost no uptake in 
PC-3 cells. As the SPECT imaging tracer, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-Q is highly specific in 
delineating PSMA-positive tumors, with a shorter clearance half-life and higher 
tumor-to-background ratio than [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. Biodistribution studies 
verified the SPECT imaging results. Furthermore, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-Q serves well as 
an effective therapeutic ligand to suppress tumor growth and improve the 
survival rate of tumor-bearing mice. All the results strongly demonstrate that 
[177Lu]Lu-PSMA-Q is a PSMA-specific ligand with significant anti-tumor effect in 
preclinical models, and further clinical evaluation is worth conducting."
1365,"Over the years, labdane diterpenes, norlabdane diterpenes, and bis-labdanic 
diterpenes with cytotoxic activities have been identified across various 
families in the plant kingdom including the Zingiberaceae. The present review 
discusses the distribution of these labdane-type diterpenes within the 
Zingiberaceae; their extraction, isolation, and characterization from the 
respective Zingiberaceae species; the structural similarities and differences 
within each group and between the different groups of the labdane-type 
diterpenes; and their cytotoxic activities against breast, cervical, liver, 
colorectal, pancreatic, lung and prostate cancer cell lines. The review will 
also provide insight into how the cytotoxic activities of the labdane-type 
diterpenes are influenced by their structural features."
1366,"Herein, the synthesis and anticancer activity evaluation of a series of novel 
β-carbolines is reported. The reactivity of nitrosoalkenes towards indole was 
explored for the synthesis of novel tryptophan analogs where the carboxylic acid 
was replaced by a triazole moiety. This tryptamine was used in the synthesis of 
3-(1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-β-carbolines via Pictet-Spengler condensation followed by 
an oxidative step. A library of compounds, including the novel 
3-(1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-β-carbolines as well as methyl β-carboline-3-carboxylate 
and 3-tetrazolyl-β-carboline derivatives, was evaluated for their 
antiproliferative activity against colorectal cancer cell lines. The 
3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-β-carbolines stood out as the most active compounds, with 
values of half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranging from 3.3 µM to 
9.6 µM against colorectal adenocarcinoma HCT116 and HT29 cell lines. The results 
also revealed a mechanism of action independent of the p53 pathway. Further 
studies with the 3-tetrazolyl-β-carboline derivative, which showed high 
selectivity for cancer cells, revealed IC50 values below 8 μM against pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma PANC-1, melanoma A375, hepatocarcinoma HEPG2, and breast 
adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell lines. Collectively, this work discloses the 
3-tetrazolyl-β-carboline derivative as a promising anticancer agent worthy of 
being further explored in future works."
1367,"Selaginella doederleinii Hieron. is a common pharmacological plant, and this 
folk herbal medicine and its complex preparations have been widely used for the 
treatment of throat carcinoma (TC) and several associated complications in 
traditional Chinese medicine. This study was aimed at investigating the specific 
anti-throat carcinoma impacts and potential mechanisms of a biflavonoid-rich 
extract from S. doederleinii (SD-BFRE). The phytochemical profiling of SD-BFRE 
was performed by HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS and UPLC-PDA, and the detailed pharmacological 
effects and mechanisms were respectively evaluated in vitro and in vivo. MTT 
assay, the Transwell assay and flow cytometry were performed to evaluate the 
abilities of SD-BFRE on inhibiting cell infiltrative growth in TC cells (Hep-2 
and FaDu) in in vitro experiments. In vivo experiments used Hep-2 tumor-bearing 
nude mice to evaluate the anti-TC effect of SD-BFRE. Western blotting was used 
to explore the potential apoptotic pathway of TC cells. Here, we found that 
SD-BFRE exhibited anti-proliferation and pro-apoptotic effects in TC cells. 
Mechanistic studies have identified that SD-BFRE can suppress the activity of 
IKKβ and IκB-α kinase and then down-regulate the effector proteins of 
NF-κB/COX-2 signaling. Moreover, SD-BFRE induced apoptosis partly by regulating 
the Akt/Bad/caspase signaling pathway. Taken together, this study firstly 
demonstrated that SD-BFRE exerted its anti-TC effects by way of IKKβ/NF-κB/COX-2 
and Akt/Bad pathways and might represent a potential chemotherapeutic agent for 
throat carcinoma."
1368,"Plants have been considered for many years as an important source of medicine to 
treat different diseases. Xanthium spinosum L. (Asteraceae, Compositae) is known 
for its diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and sedative effects. It is also used in 
the treatment of several ailments, such as cancer. In order to evaluate the 
anticancer and immunomodulatory activities, crude ethanol extract was prepared 
from the aerial part of X. spinosum and then fractionated using solvents with 
different polarities. As well, the chemical composition of X. spinosum extract 
and fractions were identified using LC-MS analysis. The antitumor effect of X. 
spinosum was assessed in both in vitro and in vivo models. Apoptosis induction 
was measured in vitro using a caspase-3 activity kit. Lymphocyte proliferation 
and phagocytosis and pinocytosis induction were used to quantify the effect of 
the plant extract and fractions on acquired and innate immunity, respectively. 
The effect of X. spinosum extract, and fractions on the levels of cytokines 
(IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10) in murine lymphocytes was determined using a 
mouse-uncoated TH1/TH2 ELISA kit. Results showed that ethanol extract had the 
highest antiproliferative activity (IC₅₀ = 2.5 mg mL-1) against EMT6/P cell 
lines, while the aqueous and chloroform fractions had the highest apoptotic 
activity with 2.2 and 1.7 folds, respectively. On the other hand, the n-hexane 
fraction was the most effective in stimulating lymphocyte proliferation, whereas 
ethanol extract, aq. Methanol and aqueous fractions exhibited the highest 
phagocytic activity. As well, X. spinosum extract and fractions were able to 
modulate the expression of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ. A remarkable decrease in tumor 
size was accomplished following the treatment of tumor-bearing mice with X. 
spinosum extract and fractions. Both aq. Methanol and chloroform fractions 
showed the highest percentage change in tumor size with -58 and -55%, 
respectively. As well, tumor-bearing mice treated with chloroform fraction 
demonstrated a high curable percentage with a value of 57.1%. Anyway, X. 
spinosum extract and fractions exhibited no toxic impact on the liver or kidney 
functions of the mice-treated groups. These findings may confirm that X. 
spinosum has favorable anticancer and immunomodulatory effects. However, 
additional studies are required to fully understand the mechanisms of action of 
this plant and the signaling pathways involved in its effects. Moreover, more 
testing is needed to have better insight into the apoptotic pathway and to know 
the exact concentration of active compounds."
1369,"Emerging evidence supports the role of rice bran in cancer prevention. Studies 
were conducted on multiple rice cultivars. However, limited studies were 
conducted on rice cultivars in the Middle East. In this study, rice bran growing 
in Iraq (O. sativa ssp. Japonica, cultivars: Amber Barka) was evaluated for its 
effect on preventing cancer and stimulating the immune system. Rice bran was 
collected from local mills in Al-Najaf (south of Iraq). Several solvent extracts 
(ethanol, methanol, n-hexane, and water) were prepared by maceration. MTT assay 
was used to measure the antiproliferative effects of extracts against a panel of 
cancer cell lines. The ability of each extract to induce apoptosis and inhibit 
angiogenesis was measured using standard ELISA kits. The effect of extracts on 
the immune system was evaluated using a lymphocyte proliferation assay, a 
pinocytic activity assay, a phagocytic activity assay, and a Th1/Th2 cytokine 
detection kit. A microbroth dilution method was used to detect the antimicrobial 
activity of each extract against different microbial strains. LC-MS analysis was 
used to detect the phytochemical composition of extracts, while DPPH assay was 
used to determine the antioxidant activity. For the in vivo study, rice bran was 
added to mouse fodder at 10% and 20%. Mice were treated for two weeks using 
mouse fodder supplemented with rice bran. In the third week of the experiment, 
EMT6/P breast cancer cells (1 × 10⁶ cells/mL) were injected subcutaneously into 
the abdominal area of each mouse. The dimensions of the grown tumors were 
measured after 14 days of tumor inoculation. A microbroth dilution method was 
used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of rice bran extracts against three 
bacterial strains. The highest antiproliferative activity was observed in 
ethanol and n-hexane extracts. Ethanol and methanol extract showed the highest 
activity to induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis. Both extracts were also 
effective to enhance immunity by activating lymphocytes and phagocytes 
proliferation with modulations of cytokine levels. The incorporation of rice 
bran in mice food caused a 20% regression in tumor development and growth 
compared with the negative control. All extracts exhibited limited antimicrobial 
activity against tested microorganisms. Methanol extract showed antioxidant 
activity with an IC50 value of 114 µg/mL. LC-MS analysis revealed the presence 
of multiple phytochemicals in rice bran including apiin, ferulic acid, and 
succinic acid. Rice bran is a rich source of active phytochemicals that may 
inhibit cancer and stimulate the immune system. Rice bran's biological 
activities could be due to the presence of multiple synergistically active 
phytochemicals. Further studies are needed to understand the exact mechanisms of 
action of rice bran."
1370,"Little is known about the pharmacological activity of Ammodaucus 
leucotrichus&amp;nbsp;Coss. & Dur., a small annual species that grows in the 
Saharan and sub-Saharan countries. In the present study, we investigated whether 
the standardized ethanolic extract of A. leucotrichus fruits and 
R-perillaldehyde, a monoterpenoid isolated from A. leucotrichus fruits, are able 
to affect different processes involved in different phases of cancer 
development. In particular, we explored their genoprotective, proapoptotic, 
antiproliferative, and cytodifferentiating potential on different human cell 
models. We analyzed the genoprotective and proapoptotic activity on human 
lymphoblast cells (TK6) using the micronucleus test, and the cytodifferentiation 
effects on human promyelocytic cells (HL60) through the evaluation of different 
markers of differentiation forward granulocytes or monocytes. The results showed 
that the extract and perillaldehyde were able to induce apoptosis and protect 
from clastogen-induced DNA damage. To our best knowledge, this is the first 
report on the ability of A. leucotrichus and perillaldehyde to induce apoptosis 
and protect DNA from the toxicity of different compounds. Data reported in this 
work are the starting point for their pharmacological use. Going forward, 
efforts to determine their effects on other events associated with cancer 
development, such as angiogenesis and metastasization, will provide important 
information and improve our understanding of their potential in cancer therapy."
1371,"Considering the individual characteristics of positron emission tomography (PET) 
and optical imaging (OI) in terms of sensitivity, spatial resolution, and tissue 
penetration, the development of dual imaging agents for bimodal PET/OI imaging 
is a growing field. A current major breakthrough in this field is the design of 
monomolecular agent displaying both a radioisotope for PET and a fluorescent dye 
for OI. We took advantage of the multifunctionalities allowed by a clickable 
C-glycosyl scaffold to gather the different elements. We describe, for the first 
time, the synthesis of a cyanine-based dual PET/OI imaging probe based on a 
versatile synthetic strategy and its direct radiofluorination via [18F]F-C bond 
formation. The non-radioactive dual imaging probe coupled with two c(RGDfK) 
peptides was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in fluorescence imaging. The binding 
on αvβ3 integrin (IC50 = 16 nM) demonstrated the efficiency of the dimeric 
structure and PEG linkers in maintaining the affinity. In vivo fluorescence 
imaging of U-87 MG engrafted nude mice showed a high tumor uptake (40- and 
100-fold increase for orthotopic and ectopic brain tumors, respectively, 
compared to healthy brain). In vitro and in vivo evaluations and resection of 
the ectopic tumor demonstrated the potential of the conjugate in glioblastoma 
cancer diagnosis and image-guided surgery."
1372,"In vitro drug release testing is an important quality control tool for 
formulation development. However, the literature has evidence that 
poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA)-based formulations show a slower in vitro drug 
release than a real in vivo drug release. Much longer in vitro drug release 
profiles may not be reflective of real in vivo performances and may 
significantly affect the timeline for a formulation development. The objective 
of this study was to develop a surfactant mediated accelerated in vitro drug 
release method for the PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) of a novel chemotherapeutic 
agent AC1LPSZG, a model drug with a poor solubility. The Sotax USP apparatus 4 
was used to test in vitro drug release in a phosphate buffer with a pH value of 
6.8. The sink conditions were improved using surfactants in the order of sodium 
lauryl sulfate (SLS) &lt; Tween 80 &lt; cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). 
The dissolution efficiency (DE) and area under the dissolution curve (AUC) were 
increased three-fold when increasing the CTAB concentration in the phosphate 
buffer (pH 6.8). Similar Weibull release kinetics and good linear correlations 
(R2~0.99) indicated a good correlation between the real-time in vitro release 
profile in the phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and accelerated release profiles in the 
optimized medium. This newly developed accelerated and discriminatory in vitro 
test can be used as a quality control tool to identify critical formulation and 
process parameters to ensure a batch-to-batch uniformity. It may also serve as a 
surrogate for bioequivalence studies if a predictive in vitro in vivo 
correlation (IVIVC) is obtained. The results of this study are limited to 
AC1LPSZG NPs, but a similar consideration can be extended to other PLGA-based 
NPs of drugs with similar properties and solubility profiles."
1373,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is currently considered to be an important 
therapeutic method, which obtained FDA approval for clinical use in gastric 
cancer in 2017. As a new mechanism, it was found that the effect of αPDL1 could 
be improved by blocking the TGF-β1 signaling pathway, which converts the tumor 
immune microenvironment from the ""immune-excluded phenotype"" to the 
""immune-inflamed phenotype"". Based on this phenomenon, this project was designed 
to prepare TGF-β1-siRNA-loaded PEG-PCL nanoparticles conjugated to αPDL1 
(siTGF-β1-αPDL1-PEG-PCL) since we have linked similar antibodies to PEG-PCL 
previously. Therefore, MFC tumor-engrafted mice were established to simulate the 
biological characteristics of converting the phenotype of the immune 
microenvironment, and to study the anti-tumor effect and possible molecular 
mechanism. In this study, αPDL1 antibody conjugates markedly increased the cell 
uptake of NPs. The produced αPDL1-PEG-PCL NPs efficiently reduced the amounts of 
TGF-β1 mRNA in MFC cells, converting the immune microenvironment of MFC tumors 
engrafted mice from the ""immune-excluded phenotype"" to the ""immune-inflamed 
phenotype"". PDL1-harboring gastric cancer had increased susceptibility to αPDL1. 
The value of this drug-controlled release system targeting the tumor 
microenvironment in immune checkpoint therapy of gastric cancer would provide a 
scientific basis for clinically applying nucleic acid drugs."
1374,"In order to explore novel immunomodulatory agents as anti-tumor drugs, we 
designed and synthesized a series of new pomalidomide derivatives containing 
urea moieties. Interestingly, in vitro biological experiments performed in 
several cancer cell lines showed that some of them displayed potent anti-tumor 
ability. These novel compounds 5a-5e and 6a-6e demonstrated the best cell growth 
inhibitive activity in human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, but weaker 
inhibitive activity in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines Huh7. Moreover, 
compound 5d had the most powerful effects in this study, with an IC50 value of 
20.2 μM in MCF-7. Further study indicated that compound 5d could inhibit cell 
growth and induce cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Besides, 
compound 5d increased cellular ROS levels and induced DNA damage, thereby 
potentially leading to cell apoptosis. These observations suggest that the novel 
pomalidomide derivatives containing urea moieties may be worth further 
investigation to generate potential anti-tumor drugs."
1375,"Gastric cancer (GC) is among the five most common malignancies worldwide. 
Traditional chemotherapy cannot efficiently treat the disease and faces the 
problems of side effects and chemoresistance. Polygoni orientalis Fructus (POF), 
with flavonoids as the main bioactive compounds, exerts anti-cancer potential. 
In this study, we compared the anti-GC effects of the main flavonoids from POF 
and investigated the anti-cancer effects of eriodictyol towards GC both in vitro 
and in vivo. CCK-8 assays were performed to examine the inhibitory effects of 
common flavonoids from POF on GC cell viability. Colony formation assays were 
used to determine cell proliferation after eriodictyol treatment. Cell cycle 
distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry. Induction of apoptosis was 
assessed with Annexin V/PI staining and measurement of related proteins. 
Anti-cancer effects in vivo were investigated using a xenograft mouse model. 
Potential targets of eriodictyol were clarified by network pharmacological 
analysis, evaluated by molecular docking, and validated with Western blotting. 
We found that eriodictyol exhibited the most effective inhibitory effect on cell 
viability of GC cells among the common flavonoids from POF including quercetin, 
taxifolin, and kaempferol. Eriodictyol suppressed colony formation of GC cells 
and induced cell apoptosis. The inhibitory effects of eriodictyol on tumor 
growth were also validated using a xenograft mouse model. Moreover, no obvious 
toxicity was identified with eriodictyol treatment. Network pharmacology 
analysis revealed that PI3K/AKT signaling ranked first among the anti-GC 
targets. The molecular docking model of eriodictyol and PI3K was constructed, 
and the binding energy was evaluated. Furthermore, efficient inhibition of 
phosphorylation and activation of PI3K/AKT by eriodictyol was validated in GC 
cells. Taken together, our results identify eriodictyol as the most effective 
anti-GC flavonoids from POF and the potential targets of eriodictyol in GC. 
These findings suggest that eriodictyol has the potential to be a natural source 
of anti-GC agents."
1376,"A new series of 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-based compounds featuring 
pyridinium (3), substituted piperazines (4a-g), benzyl piperidine (4i), and aryl 
aminothiazoles (5a-e) heterocycles were synthesized. Evaluation of the 
cytotoxicity potential of the new compounds against MCF-7 and HepG2 cancer cell 
lines indicated that compounds 4e and 4i displayed the highest activity toward 
the tested cancer cells. A selectivity study demonstrated the high selective 
cytotoxicity of 4e and 4i towards cancerous cells over normal mammalian Vero 
cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that treatment with either compound 4e or 4i 
induced cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases in HepG2 and MCF-7 cells, 
respectively. Moreover, the significant increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and 
caspase 9 levels in HepG2 and MCF-7 cells treated with either 4e or 4i indicated 
that their cytotoxic effect is attributed to the ability to induce apoptotic 
cell death. Finally, an in vivo radioactive tracing study of compound 4i proved 
its targeting ability to sarcoma cells in a tumor-bearing mice model."
1377,"Lung cancer is considered the most commonly diagnosed cancer and one of the 
leading causes of death globally. Despite the responses from small-cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients to conventional 
chemo- and radiotherapies, the current outcomes are not satisfactory. Recently, 
novel advances in DNA sequencing technologies have started to take off which 
have provided promising tools for studying different tumors for systematic 
mutation discovery. To date, a limited number of DDR inhibition trials have been 
conducted for the treatment of SCLC and NSCLC patients. However, strategies to 
test different DDR inhibitor combinations or to target multiple pathways are yet 
to be explored. With the various biomarkers that have either been recently 
discovered or are the subject of ongoing investigations, it is hoped that future 
trials would be designed to allow for studying targeted treatments in a 
biomarker-enriched population, which is defensible for the improvement of 
prognosis for SCLC and NSCLC patients. This review article sheds light on the 
different DNA repair pathways and some of the inhibitors targeting the proteins 
involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) machinery, such as ataxia 
telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR), DNA-dependent protein kinase 
(DNA-PK), and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). In addition, the current status 
of DDR inhibitors in clinical settings and future perspectives are discussed."
1378,"Brain metastasis predicts a worse clinical outcome in cancer patients. Emerging 
observational evidence suggests that statin use has a protective role in overall 
cancer prevention. Whether statin use could also be a supplementary treatment 
for advanced-stage cancers remains under researched and controversial. Data for 
cancer patients with brain metastasis were selected from the linked electronic 
medical care records of the West China Hospital between October 2010 and July 
2019. Fisher's exact chi-square test was used to compare the differences between 
cohorts. Multivariate Cox analysis was conducted to adjust the potential 
confounders in evaluating the role of statin use in the overall survival (OS) of 
cancer patients with brain metastasis. There were 4510 brain metastatic patients 
included in this retrospective study. The overall statin use rate in our 
patients was 5.28% (219 cases/4510 cases). Compared with the non-statin use 
cohort, patients who received statin therapy showed a decreased Karnofsky 
performance score (KPS, p &lt; 0.001) and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL, p 
= 0.020) but higher body mass index (BMI, p = 0.002) and triglyceride (TG, p 
&lt; 0.001) at admission. There was no association between statin use and the OS 
of the cancer patients with brain metastasis (Hazard ratio (HR) = 0.90, 95% 
confidence interval (CI): 0.73-1.07, p = 0.213) during the univariate analysis. 
However, after adjusting for baseline patient characteristics, metabolism 
indicators, and cancer-specific factors, statin use was shown to have a 
significant protective role, aiding the survival of the cancer patients with 
brain metastasis (adjustHR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.69-0.99, p = 0.034). Our results 
highlight that statin use shows significant survival benefits in cancer patients 
with brain metastasis. However, future research is needed to validate our 
findings."
1379,"Cancer is a serious threat to human beings and is the second-largest cause of 
death all over the globe. Chemotherapy is one of the most common treatments for 
cancer; however, drug resistance and severe adverse effects are major problems 
associated with anticancer therapy. New compounds with multi-target inhibitory 
properties are targeted to surmount these challenges. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) 
is overexpressed in cancers of the pancreas, breast, colorectal, stomach, and 
lung carcinoma. Therefore, COX-2 is considered a significant target for the 
synthesis of new anticancer agents. This review discusses the biological 
activity of recently prepared dual anticancer and COX-2 inhibitory agents. The 
most important intermolecular interactions with the COX-2 enzyme have also been 
presented. Analysis of these agents in the active area of the COX-2 enzyme could 
guide the introduction of new lead compounds with extreme selectivity and minor 
side effects."
1380,"Plant-derived natural compounds are widely used as alternative medicine in 
healthcare throughout the world. Ginkgolic acids, the phenolic compounds 
isolated from the leaves and seeds of Ginkgo biloba, are among the chemicals 
that have been explored the most. Ginkgolic acids exhibit cytotoxic activity 
against a vast number of human cancers in various preclinical models in vitro 
and in vivo. Additionally, the pharmacological activities of ginkgolic acids are 
also involved in antidiabetic, anti-bacteria, anti-virus, anti-fibrosis, and 
reno/neuroprotection. Autophagy as a highly conserved self-cleaning process that 
plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis and has been 
proven to serve as a protective mechanism in the pathogenesis of many diseases, 
including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases. In this 
review, we surveyed the pharmacological activities of the major three forms of 
ginkgolic acids (C13:0, C15:1, and C17:1) that are linked to autophagic activity 
and the mechanisms to which these compounds may participate. A growing body of 
studies in last decade suggests that ginkgolic acids may represent promising 
chemical compounds in future drug development and an alternative remedy in 
humans."
1381,"In order to enable 18F- and 177Lu-labelling within the same molecule, we 
introduced a silicon-based fluoride acceptor (SiFA) into the hexa-D-glutamate 
chain of DOTA-PP-F11N. In addition, minigastrin analogues with a prolonged as 
well as γ-linked D-glutamate chain were synthesised and evaluated. CCK-2R 
affinity (IC50, AR42J cells) and lipophilicity (logD7.4) were determined. 
Biodistribution studies at 24 h post-injection (p.i.) and µSPECT/CT imaging at 
1, 4 and 24 h p.i. were carried out in AR42J tumour-bearing CB17-SCID mice. 
CCK-2R affinity of (R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-1 to 18 was enhanced with increasing 
distance between the SiFA building block and the binding motif. Lipophilicity of 
[177Lu]Lu-(R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-1 to 18 was higher compared to that of 
[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N and [177Lu]Lu-CP04. The respective α- and γ-linked rhCCK 
derivatives revealing the highest CCK-2R affinity were further evaluated in 
vivo. In comparison with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N, [177Lu-]Lu-(R)-DOTAGA-rhCCK-9 
and -16 exhibited three- to eight-fold increased activity levels in the tumour 
at 24 h p.i. However, activity levels in the kidneys were elevated as well. We 
could show that the introduction of a lipophilic SiFA moiety into the 
hydrophilic backbone of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N led to a decelerated blood 
clearance and thus improved tumour retention. However, elevated kidney retention 
has to be addressed in future studies."
1382,"The norbornene scaffold has arisen as a promising structure in medicinal 
chemistry due to its possible therapeutic application in cancer treatment. The 
development of norbornene-based derivatives as potential chemotherapeutic agents 
is attracting significant attention. Here, we report an unprecedented review on 
the recent advances of investigations into the antitumoral efficacy of different 
compounds, including the abovementioned bicyclic scaffold in their structure, in 
combination with chemotherapeutic agents or forming metal complexes. The impact 
that structural modifications to these bicyclic compounds have on the 
antitumoral properties and the mechanisms by which these norbornene derivatives 
act are discussed in this review. In addition, the use of norbornene, and its 
related compounds, encapsulation in nanosystems for its use in cancer therapies 
is here detailed."
1383,"Metastasis, in which cancer cells migrate to other tissues and form new tumors, 
is a major cause of both cancer death and treatment failure. In a previous 
study, benproperine (Benp) was identified as a cancer cell migration inhibitor 
and an inhibitor of actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 2 (ARPC2). 
However, Benp is a racemic mixture, and which stereoisomer is the active isomer 
remains unclear. In this study, we found that S-Benp is an active isomer and 
inhibits the migration and invasion of cancer cells much more strongly than 
R-Benp, with no effect on normal cells. The metastasis inhibitory effect of 
S-Benp was also verified in an animal model. Validating that inhibitors bind to 
their targets in cells and tissues has been a very challenging task in drug 
discovery. The direct interactions between ARPC2 and S-Benp were verified by 
surface plasmon resonance analysis (SPR), a cellular thermal shift assay 
(CETSA), and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS). In the mutant 
study with ARPC2F225A cells, S-Benp did not bind to ARPC2F225A according to 
CETSA and DARTS. Furthermore, we validated that S-Benp colocalized with ARPC2 in 
cancer cells and directly bound to ARPC2 in tumor tissues using Cy3-conjugated 
S-Benp according to CETSA. Finally, actin polymerization assays and 
immunocytochemistry showed that S-Benp suppressed actin remodeling such as 
lamellipodium formation. Taken together, our data suggest that S-Benp is an 
active stereoisomer of Benp and a potential metastasis inhibitor via ARPC2 
binding."
1384,"New and detailed data are presented on the phytochemical composition of the 
volatile and non-volatile organic compounds of the Mediterranean endemic species 
Portenschlagiella ramosissima (Port.) Tutin. Both the essential oil and hydrosol 
were obtained from the air-dried plant by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry. The volatile compounds from the fresh and 
air-dried plants and from the hydrosol were isolated for the first time by 
headspace solid-phase microextraction using two fibres of different polarity. 
The benzene derivative group was the predominant group in all samples, with 
myristicin being the most abundant component of all. The non-volatile compounds 
of the methanol extract were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid 
chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry with electrospray ionisation, 
and three flavonoid glycosides, one anthocyanidin glycoside, and lipid 
derivatives were detected. Both the chemical composition and biological 
activities of this plant have been described in a very limited number of 
publications, making it an interesting source for further study. The 
antiphytoviral activity of the essential oil and hydrosol showed that both 
extracts significantly reduced the number of lesions on the leaves of local host 
plants infected with tobacco mosaic virus. Moderate antiproliferative activity 
of the methanol extract was detected in three cancer cell lines, cervical cancer 
cell line, human colon cancer cell line and human osteosarcoma cell line, using 
the MTS-based cell proliferation assay. Based on the results, we highlight this 
plant as a new source of bioactive compounds and natural phytotherapeutic agent 
that deserves further investigation."
1385,"In this work, lipid-based nanoparticles (LBNP) were designed to combine tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI) Lapatinib (LAPA) with siRNA directed against apoptosis 
inhibitor protein Survivin (siSurvivin) in an injectable form. This nanosystem 
is based on lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) coated with a cationic polymeric shell 
composed of chitosan grafted through a transacylation reaction. The hydrophobic 
LAPA is solubilized in the inner oily core, while hydrophilic siRNA is 
associated electrostatically onto the nanocarrier's surface. The co-loaded LBNP 
showed a narrow size distribution (polydispersity index (PDI) &lt; 0.3), a size 
of 130 nm, and a slightly positive zeta potential (+21 mV). LAPA and siRNA were 
loaded in LBNP at a high rate of &gt;90% (10.6 mM) and 100% (4.6 µM), 
respectively. The siRNA-LAPA_LBNP was readily uptaken by the human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 overexpressed (HER2+) breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3. 
Moreover, the cytotoxicity studies confirmed that the blank chitosan decorated 
LBNP is not toxic to the cells with the tested concentrations, which correspond 
to LAPA concentrations from 1 to 10 µM, at different incubation times up to 96 
h. Furthermore, siCtrl.-LAPA_LBNP had a more cytotoxic effect than Lapatinib 
salt, while siSurvivin-LAPA_LBNP had a significant synergistic cytotoxic effect 
compared to siCtrl.-LAPA_LBNP. All these findings suggested that the developed 
modified LBNP could potentiate anti-Survivin siRNA and LAPA anti-cancer 
activity."
1386,"The overexpression and activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) isoforms 
CA IX and CA XII promote the accumulation of exceeding protons and acidosis in 
the extracellular tumor environment. Sulfonamides are effective inhibitors of 
most families of CAs. In this study, using scaffold-hopping, 
indoline-5-sulfonamide analogs 4a-u of the CA IX-selective inhibitor 3 were 
designed and synthesized to evaluate their biological properties. 1-Acylated 
indoline-5-sulfonamides demonstrated inhibitory activity against 
tumor-associated CA IX and XII with KI values up to 132.8 nM and 41.3 nM. 
Compound 4f, as one of the most potent inhibitors of CA IX and XII, exhibits 
hypoxic selectivity, suppressing the growth of MCF7 cells at 12.9 µM, and causes 
partial inhibition of hypoxia-induced CA IX expression in A431 skin cancer 
cells. 4e and 4f reverse chemoresistance to doxorubicin of K562/4 with 
overexpression of P-gp."
1387,"Tumor therapies have entered the immunotherapy era. Immune checkpoint inhibitors 
have achieved tremendous success, with some patients achieving long-term tumor 
control. Tumors, on the other hand, can still accomplish immune evasion, which 
is aided by immune checkpoints. The majority of immune checkpoints are membrane 
glycoproteins, and abnormal tumor glycosylation may alter how the immune system 
perceives tumors, affecting the body's anti-tumor immunity. Furthermore, RNA can 
also be glycosylated, and GlycoRNA is important to the immune system. 
Glycosylation has emerged as a new hallmark of tumors, with glycosylation being 
considered a potential therapeutic approach. The glycosylation modification of 
immune checkpoints and the most recent advances in glycosylation-targeted 
immunotherapy are discussed in this review."
1388,"Recently, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been extensively explored in a 
variety of biological applications, especially cancer treatment. AgNPs have been 
demonstrated to exhibit anti-tumor effects through cell apoptosis. This study 
intends to promote cell apoptosis further by increasing oxidative stress. AgNPs 
are encapsulated by biocompatible and biodegradable polyaspartamide (PA) 
(PA-AgNPs) that carries the anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin (Dox) to inhibit cancer 
cells primarily. PA-AgNPs have an average hydrodynamic diameter of 130 nm, 
allowing them to move flexibly within the body. PA-AgNPs show an excellent 
targeting capacity to cancer cells when they are conjugated to biotin. In 
addition, they release Dox efficiently by up to 88% in cancer environments. The 
DCFDA experiment demonstrates that the Dox-carried PA-AgNPs generate reactive 
oxidation species intensively beside 4T1 cells. The MTT experiment confirms that 
PA-AgNPs with Dox may strongly inhibit 4T1 cancer cells. Furthermore, the in 
vivo study confirms that PA-AgNPs with Dox successfully inhibit tumors, which 
are about four times smaller than the control group and have high biosafety that 
can be applied for chemotherapy."
1389,"Antiviral agents are needed for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections and to 
control other coronavirus outbreaks that may occur in the future. Here we report 
the identification and characterization of RNA-binding compounds that inhibit 
SARS-CoV-2 replication. The compounds were detected by screening a small library 
of antiviral compounds previously shown to bind HIV-1 or HCV RNA elements with a 
live-virus cellular assay detecting inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. These 
experiments allowed detection of eight compounds with promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 
activity in the sub-micromolar to micromolar range and wide selectivity indexes. 
Examination of the mechanism of action of three selected hit compounds excluded 
action on the entry or egress stages of the virus replication cycle and 
confirmed recognition by two of the molecules of conserved RNA elements of the 
SARS-CoV-2 genome, including the highly conserved S2m hairpin located in the 
3'-untranslated region of the virus. While further studies are needed to clarify 
the mechanism of action responsible for antiviral activity, these results 
facilitate the discovery of RNA-targeted antivirals and provide new chemical 
scaffolds for developing therapeutic agents against coronaviruses."
1390,"Doxorubicin (Dox) is a widely utilized chemotherapeutic; however, it carries 
side effects, including drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) and 
increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Currently, the mechanisms for 
Dox-associated DITP and VTE are poorly understood, and an effective inhibitor to 
relieve these complications remains to be developed. In this study, we found 
that Dox significantly induced platelet activation and enhanced platelet 
phagocytosis by macrophages and accelerated platelet clearance. Importantly, we 
determined that salvianolic acid C (SAC), a water-soluble compound derived from 
Danshen root traditionally used to treat cardiovascular diseases, inhibited 
Dox-induced platelet activation more effectively than current standard-of-care 
anti-platelet drugs aspirin and ticagrelor. Mechanism studies with tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors indicate contributions of phospholipase C, spleen tyrosine 
kinase, and protein kinase C signaling pathways in Dox-induced platelet 
activation. We further demonstrated that Dox enhanced platelet-cancer cell 
interaction, which was ameliorated by SAC. Taken together, these findings 
suggest SAC may be a promising therapy to reduce the risk of Dox-induced DITP, 
VTE, and the repercussions of amplified platelet-cancer interaction in the tumor 
microenvironment."
1391,"Recent research suggests that dysbiosis of the oral microbial community is 
associated with head and neck cancer (HNC). It remains unclear whether this 
dysbiosis causes chemo-radiotherapy (CRT)-related complications. However, to 
address this question, it is essential to determine the most representative oral 
site for microbiome sampling. In this study, our purpose was to determine the 
optimal site for oral sample collection and whether the presence of HNC is 
associated with altered oral microbiome from this site. In 21 newly diagnosed 
HNC patients and 27 healthy controls, microbiome samples were collected from 
saliva, swabs from buccal mucosa, tongue, hard palate, faucial pillars and all 
mucosal sites combined. Microbial DNA was extracted and underwent 16S rRNA 
amplicon gene sequencing. In healthy controls, analysis of observed taxonomic 
units detected differences in alpha- and beta-diversity between sampling sites. 
Saliva was found to have the highest intra-community microbial diversity and 
lowest within-subject (temporal) and between-subject variance. Feature 
intersection showed that most species were shared between all sites, with saliva 
demonstrating the most unique species as well as highest overlap with other 
sites. In HNC patients, saliva was found to have the highest diversity but 
differences between sites were not statistically significant. Across all sites, 
HNC patients had lower alpha diversity than healthy controls. Beta-diversity 
analysis showed HNC patients' microbiome to be compositionally distinct from 
healthy controls. This pattern was confirmed when the salivary microbiome was 
considered alone. HNC patients exhibited reduced diversity of the oral 
microbiome. Salivary samples demonstrate temporal stability, have the richest 
diversity and are sufficient to detect perturbation due to presence of HNC. 
Hence, they can be used as representative oral samples for microbiome studies in 
HNC patients."
1392,"The early diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection is important for gastric 
cancer prevention and treatment. Although endoscopic biopsy is widely used for 
H. pylori diagnosis, an accurate biopsy cannot be performed until a lesion 
becomes clear, especially in pediatric patients. Therefore, it is necessary to 
develop convenient and accurate methods for early diagnosis. FlaA, an essential 
factor for H. pylori survival, shows high antigenicity and can be used as a 
diagnostic marker. We attempted to identify effective antigens containing 
epitopes of high diagnostic value in FlaA. Full-sized FlaA was divided into 
several fragments and cloned, and its antigenicity was investigated using 
Western blotting. The FlaA fragment of 1345-1395 bp had strong immunogenicity. 
ELISA was performed with serum samples from children by using the 1345-1395 bp 
recombinant antigen fragment. IgG reactivity showed 90.0% sensitivity and 90.5% 
specificity, and IgM reactivity showed 100% sensitivity and specificity. The 
FlaA fragment of 1345-1395 bp discovered in the present study has antigenicity 
and is of high value as a candidate antigen for serological diagnosis. The FlaA 
1345-1395 bp epitope can be used as a diagnostic marker for H. pylori infection, 
thereby controlling various gastric diseases such as gastric cancer and peptic 
ulcers caused by H. pylori."
1393,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide prevalence of Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma 
(OPSCC) has increased, affecting mostly young males. OPSCC associated with Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) infection exhibits particular characteristics in terms of 
response to treatment, hence HPV has been proposed as a prognostic factor. The 
impact of HPV positivity and associated biomarkers on OPSCC in the Mexican 
population has not been addressed. Therefore, the analysis of OPSCC prognostic 
markers in the Mexican population is necessary.
METHODS: Retrolective study in Mexican OPSCC patients, where HPV prevalence, p16 
and EGFR levels were assessed using INNO-LiPA and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: We found an HPV prevalence of 57.6% in OPSCC cases treated at a 
reference center in Mexico. HPV and p16 positivity, as well as EGFR, associate 
with better outcomes in OPSCC patients, and they also promote reduced death 
risk. Notably, HPV presence and p16 positivity showed a significant association 
with disease-free survival (DFS), with a HR of 0.15 (p = 0.006) and a HR of 0.17 
(p = 0.012), respectively, indicating a possible role as predictive biomarkers 
in Mexican OPSCC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results reflect the clinical utility of p16 analysis to improve 
overall survival (OS) and to predict recurrence in oropharyngeal cancer. These 
results position p16 and HPV as predictive biomarkers for OPSCC."
1394,"Wildlife shares grazing areas with herders in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, 
and humans can be infected by zoonotic nematodes through direct contact with 
animals or contaminated water. In this study, fecal samples (n = 296) from wild 
carnivores were collected to explore the infection rate and molecular genetic 
characteristics of nematodes by stratified random sampling in the survey areas. 
Host species and the nematodes they carried were then identified using 16S rRNA 
and 18S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Statistical analysis, neutrality 
tests, genetic diversity analysis and Bayesian inferred trees were performed to 
complete the study. In total, 10 species of nematodes were detected in 240 feces 
from six species of carnivores identified (including dominant Vulpes ferrilata 
and Vulpes vulpes), namely Uncinaria stenocephala, Toxascaris sp., Crenosoma 
vulpis, Parapharyngodon bainae, Oesophagostomum muntiacum, Aspiculuris 
tetraptera, Mastophorus muris, Nematodirus spathiger, Muellerius capillaris, and 
Molineus patens. Among these nematodes, U. stenocephala (35.83%, 86/240) and 
Toxascaris sp. (14.58%, 35/240) were detected at higher rates than the other 
nematodes (χ2 = 516.909, p &lt; 0.05). Of 17 and 18 haplotypes were found based 
on the ITS1 gene for U. stenocephala and nad1 gene for Toxascaris sp., 
respectively. For the first time, using molecular methods, we report the 
infection of V. ferrilata by U. stenocephala, a potential zoonotic parasite, and 
suggest Toxascaris sp. may be a newly discovered nematode that lives within the 
fox intestine."
1395,"Some estimates place the proportion of human malignancies attributable to 
viruses at between 15 and 20 percent. Viruses including the human papillomavirus 
are considered an interesting but controversial etiological risk factor for 
breast cancer. HPV infection is anticipated to be an early trigger in breast 
cancer carcinogenesis, followed by cumulative alterations over time (""hit and 
run"" mechanism) through synergy with other environmental factors. The 
association between HPV and breast cancer has not yet been verified. There are 
very conflicting data on the presence of HPV DNA in breast cancer samples, and 
we lack a clarified, exact mode of HPV transmission to the breast. In our review 
article we analyzed the up-to-date knowledge about the association of HPV and 
breast cancer. Furthermore, we summarized the available original research 
published since 2010. In conclusion, the complexity and inconsistency of the 
available results together with the relatively low prevalence of HPV infection 
requires extensive research with much larger studies and exact and unified 
diagnostic methods are required to better understand the role of the HPV in 
breast carcinogenesis."
1396,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes both acute and chronic infection of the liver 
that can lead to liver cirrhosis, cancer, and liver failure. HCV is 
characterized by high genetic diversity and substantial variations in the 
prevalence of specific HCV genotypes throughout the world. Many effective 
regimens of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), including pan-genotypic, can 
successfully treat HCV infection. Additionally, genotype-specific treatments for 
HCV are being actively employed in national plans for eliminating HCV infection 
around the world. The evaluation of HCV genotype prevalence in a given country 
is necessary for the successful implementation of the HCV elimination plans and 
for allocating financial resources to the DAAs which are the most effective 
against those specific HCV genotypes prevalent in a given country. Here, we 
analyzed HCV genotypes, subgenotypes, and recombinants in 10,107 serum samples 
collected in 2015-2017 from patients with chronic HCV infection living in all 
federal districts of Russia. This is the first and largest evaluation of HCV 
genotypes performed on samples from all territories of Russia, from its Central 
federal district to the Far East. Moreover, we have updated retrospective 
epidemiological analysis of chronic and acute HCV infection in Russia from 2001 
to 2021. We demonstrate that the incidence of acute HCV (AHC) infection in 
Russia decreased from 16.7 cases per 100,000 people in 2001 to 0.6/100,000 in 
2021. The number of cases of chronic HCV (CHC) infection also decreased from 
29.5 to 16.4 per 100,000 people during this period. The HCV genotype analysis 
indicated that HCV genotype 1 dominates in Russia (53.6%), while genotypes 3 and 
2 were detected in 35.4% and 7.8% of patients, respectively. These proportions 
are virtually identical in all regions of Russia except for the Far East, where 
HCV genotype 2 was detected in only 1% of the samples. HCV genotypes 1 and 2 are 
more widespread in women, and HCV genotype 3 in men. Genotype 3 was the most 
prevalent in 31-40-year-olds (44.9%), and genotype 1 was most prevalent in those 
over 70 years of age (72.2%). HCV genotype 2 was predominant among HCV-infected 
persons older than 40 years. Discriminating between HCV genotype 2 and 
recombinant RF1_2k/1b, which are frequently misclassified, is important for 
successful antiviral treatment. For the first time, we demonstrate, here, 
countrywide prevalence of HCV RF1_2k/1b in different regions of Russia. HCV 
RF1_2k/1b makes up 3.2% of HCV genotypes, reaching 30% among samples classified 
as genotype 2 by some commercial genotyping tests. The highest proportion of HCV 
RF1_2k/1b was detected in the North-West (60%), Southern (41.6%), and Central 
(31.6%) federal districts; its frequency in the Far Eastern and North Caucasus 
districts was ~14.3%. HCV RF1_2k/1b, and it was not detected in the Volga, Ural, 
or Siberian districts. To conclude, this is the first and most complete 
evaluation of HCV epidemiology and genotype/subgenotype distribution in Russia."
1397,"Prophylactic vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) have proven efficacy in 
those who have not been infected by the virus. However, they do not benefit 
patients with established tumors. Therefore, the development of therapeutic 
options for HPV-related malignancies is critical. Third-generation vaccines 
based on nucleic acids are fast and simple approaches to eliciting adaptive 
immune responses. However, techniques to boost immunogenicity, reduce 
degradation, and facilitate their capture by immune cells are frequently 
required. One option to overcome this constraint is to employ delivery systems 
that allow selective antigen absorption and help modulate the immune response. 
This review aimed to discuss the influence of these different systems on the 
response generated by nucleic acid vaccines. The results indicate that delivery 
systems based on lipids, polymers, and microorganisms such as yeasts can be used 
to ensure the stability and transport of nucleic acid vaccines to their 
respective protein synthesis compartments. Thus, in view of the limitations of 
nucleic acid-based vaccines, it is important to consider the type of delivery 
system to be used-due to its impact on the immune response and desired final 
effect."
1398,"The interactions between aromatase inhibitors (AI) in breast cancer (BC) and gut 
microbiota (GM) have not been completely established yet. The aim of the study 
is to evaluate the bio-diversity of GM and the relationship between GM, 
inflammation and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in postmenopausal women 
with BC during adjuvant AI treatment compared to women with disease relapse 
during or after one year of AI therapy (""endocrine-resistant""). We conducted a 
monocenter observational case-control study. Eighty-four women with BC (8 cases, 
76 controls) were enrolled from 2019 to 2021. We observed a significant 
difference in the mean microbial abundance between the two groups for the 
taxonomic rank of order (p 0.035) and family (p 0.029); specifically, the case 
group showed higher diversity than the control group. Veillonella reached its 
maximum abundance in cases (p 0.022). Cytokine levels were compared among the 
groups created considering the TILs levels. We obtained a statistically 
significant difference (p 0.045) in IL-17 levels among the groups, with patients 
with low TILs levels showing a higher median value for IL-17 (0.15 vs. 0.08 
pg/mL). Further studies about the bio-diversity in women with BC may lead to the 
development of new biomarkers and targeted interventions."
1399,"Treatment regimens for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) typically 
include cisplatin and radiotherapy and are limited by toxicities. We have 
identified naturally derived withalongolide A triacetate (WGA-TA) from Physalis 
longifolia as a lead compound for targeting HNSCC. We hypothesized that 
combining WGA-TA with cisplatin may allow for lower, less toxic cisplatin doses. 
HNSCC cell lines were treated with WGA-TA and cisplatin. After treatment with 
the drugs, the cell viability was determined by MTS assay. The combination index 
was calculated using CompuSyn. The expression of proteins involved in the 
targeting of translational initiation complex, epithelial to mesenchymal 
transition (EMT), and apoptosis were measured by western blot. Invasion and 
migration were measured using the Boyden-chamber assay. Treatment of MDA-1986 
and UMSCC-22B cell lines with either WGA-TA or cisplatin alone for 72 h resulted 
in a dose dependent decrease in cell viability. Cisplatin in combination with 
WGA-TA resulted in significant synergistic cell death starting from 1.25 μM 
cisplatin. Combination treatment with WGA-TA resulted in lower cisplatin dosing 
while maintaining the downregulation of translational initiation complex 
proteins, the induction of apoptosis, and the blockade of migration, invasion, 
and EMT transition. These results suggest that combining a low concentration of 
cisplatin with WGA-TA may provide a safer, more effective therapeutic option for 
HNSCC that warrants translational validation."
1400,"There is currently a growing anti-gluten trend which, except for individuals 
with coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) for whom its 
intake is contraindicated, results in gluten (the main protein in wheat and 
other cereals) being considered harmful to health and excluded from diets, 
largely due to information distributed through social networks. However, in many 
cases the recommendation to exclude gluten from the diet goes beyond personal 
choice and is promoted by health professionals. This choice and/or 
recommendation is especially important to individuals with chronic inflammatory 
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), for which this exclusion is 
justified to reduce the symptoms of the disease. The aim of this literature 
review is to assess whether there is scientific evidence to justify the 
elimination of gluten in patients with RA, neither coeliac nor with NCGS, to 
improve their symptoms and quality of life. The results of the search on gluten 
and RA carried out in the Embase database and the extraction of data from 16 
articles included in the review are presented. No scientific evidence was found 
to recommend the exclusion of gluten in patients with RA."
1401,"Tamoxifen is commonly used to treat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Phytoconstituents are considered candidates for 
chemopreventive drugs in cancer treatment. However, it remains unknown what 
would happen if tamoxifen and phytoconstituents were administrated 
simultaneously. We aimed to observe the synergistic antitumor effects of 
tamoxifen and naringenin/quercetin on human hepatic carcinoma and to explore the 
potential underlying molecular mechanisms. The HepG2 cell line was used as an in 
vitro model. Cell proliferation, invasion, migration, cycle progression and 
apoptosis were investigated along with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production 
and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) repression. The signaling pathways 
involved were identified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
analysis. As the results show, tamoxifen in combination with higher 
concentrations of naringenin or quercetin significantly inhibited cell growth 
compared to either agent alone. These antiproliferative effects were accompanied 
by the inhibition of cell migration and invasion but the stimulation of cell 
apoptosis and loss of ΔΨm, which depended on the ROS-regulated p53 signaling 
cascades. Conversely, lower concentrations of naringenin and quercetin inhibited 
the tamoxifen-induced cell antiproliferative effects by regulating cell 
migration, invasion, cycle and apoptosis. Taken together, our findings revealed 
that phytoconstituents exerted contradictory cytoprotective and cytotoxic 
effects induced by tamoxifen in human hepatic cancer."
1402,"Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production contributes to brain 
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury through many mechanisms including 
inflammation, apoptosis, and cellular necrosis. Chebulic acid (CA) isolated from 
Terminalia chebula has been found to have various biological effects, such as 
antioxidants. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the anti-hypoxic 
neuroprotective effect of CA in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that CA 
could protect against oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced 
neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, as evidenced by the enhancement of cell 
viability and improvement of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) in SH-SY5Y 
cells. CA also attenuated OGD/R-induced elevations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 
ROS in SH-SY5Y cells. Nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is one of the 
key regulators of endogenous antioxidant defense. CA acted as antioxidants 
indirectly by upregulating antioxidant-responsive-element (ARE) and Nrf2 nuclear 
translocation to relieve OGD/R-induced oxidative damage. Furthermore, the 
results showed that CA treatment resulted in a significant decrease in ischemic 
infarct volume and improved performance in the motor ability of mice 24 h after 
stroke. This study provides a new niche targeting drug to oppose ischemic stroke 
and reveals the promising potential of CA for the control of ischemic stroke in 
humans."
1403,"Stress-induced neuroinflammation is widely regarded as one of the primary causes 
of depression. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-enriched foods relieve stress and 
reduce inflammatory reactions. This study aimed to evaluate whether rice germ 
with 30% GABA (RG) reduced neuroinflammation in mice exposed to chronic 
unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). CUMS mice were administered 40, 90, and 140 
mg/kg of RG. CUMS increased serum and hypothalamic pro-inflammatory cytokine 
(TNF-α and IL-6) levels, which were decreased by RG. In the hypothalamus, CUMS 
elevated M1-type microglia markers of CD86 and NF-κB, whereas RG lowered these 
levels. The expression levels of NLRP3 inflammasome complex (NLRP3, 
apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, 
and caspase-1), IL-1β, and IL-18 were increased in the hypothalamus of CUMS mice 
and decreased by RG. RG attenuated depressive-like behaviors in CUMS mice, as 
measured by the forced swim test and tail suspension test. In conclusion, RG 
decreased hypothalamic inflammation-related signals, such as TNF-α, IL-6, M1 
polarization, NF-κB, NLRP3 inflammasome complex, caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18, to 
diminish depressive-like behavior."
1404,"In recent years, evidence has shown the potential therapeutic effects of 
different natural compounds for the prevention and treatment of 
radiotherapy-induced mucositis (RIOM). RIOM represents one of the most frequent 
side effects associated with anti-neoplastic treatments affecting patients' 
quality of life and treatment response due to radiation therapy discontinuation. 
The innate radio-protective ability of natural products obtained from plants is 
in part due to the numerous antioxidants possessed as a part of their normal 
secondary metabolic processes. However, oxygen presence is a key point for 
radiation efficacy on cancer cells. The aim of this review is to describe the 
most recent evidence on radiation-induced injury and the emerging protective 
role of natural compounds in preventing and treating this specific damage 
without compromising treatment efficacy."
1405,"Hyperprolactinemia in males with prolactin-secreting adenomas, or prolactinomas, 
may be associated with endothelial dysfunction and co-existing cardiovascular 
risk factors. As a noninvasive technique of assessing cardiac function, 
impedance cardiography (ICG) may be useful in the early detection of hemodynamic 
dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to analyze and compare the 
hemodynamic profiles of patients with prolactinoma versus controls. A total of 
20 men with prolactinoma (PR group) (mean age 43 years) and 20 men from the 
control group (CG) were evaluated in this prospective, observational comparative 
clinical study. The study subjects were propensity score-matched in terms of 
clinical characteristics-age, mean blood pressure [MBP], arterial hypertension 
[AH] rates, and body mass index [BMI]. ICG assessments of hemodynamic profiles 
were conducted with the use of a Niccomo™ device and included stroke volume 
index (SI), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), 
velocity index (VI), acceleration index (ACI), Heather index (HI), and thoracic 
fluid content (TFC). AH was well-controlled in both study groups (116/76 mmHg PR 
vs. 119/76 mmHg CG). In comparison with CG patients, ICG revealed PR group 
patients to have higher rates of high thoracic fluid content (TFC) (&gt;35 
1/kOhm; p = 0.035) and lower SI values (&lt;35 mL/m2, p = 0.072). There was a 
convergent tendency towards lower values of other cardiac function parameters 
(SI, CI, VI, ACI, and HI). Prolactinoma-associated endocrine abnormalities are 
related to hemodynamic profile alterations, including higher rates of increased 
TFC and the risk of worsened cardiac function."
1406,"We perform quantitative studies to investigate the effect of high-calorie diet 
on Drosophila oogenesis. We use the central composite design (CCD) method to 
obtain quadratic regression models of body fat and fertility as a function of 
the concentrations of protein and sucrose, two major macronutrients in 
Drosophila diet, and treatment duration. Our results reveal complex interactions 
between sucrose and protein in impacting body fat and fertility when they are 
considered as an integrated physiological response. We verify the utility of our 
quantitative modeling approach by experimentally confirming the physiological 
responses-including increased body fat, reduced fertility, and ovarian insulin 
insensitivity-expected of a treatment condition identified by our modeling 
method. Under this treatment condition, we uncover a Drosophila oogenesis 
phenotype that exhibits an accumulation of immature oocytes and a halt in the 
production of mature oocytes, a phenotype that bears resemblance to key aspects 
of the human condition of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Our analysis of the 
dynamic progression of different aspects of diet-induced pathophysiology also 
suggests an order of the onset timing for obesity, ovarian dysfunction, and 
insulin resistance. Thus, our study documents the utility of quantitative 
modeling approaches toward understanding the biology of Drosophila female 
reproduction, in relation to diet-induced obesity and type II diabetes, serving 
as a potential disease model for human ovarian dysfunction."
1407,"It is widely accepted that the gut microbiota plays a significant role in 
modulating inflammatory and immune responses of their host. In recent years, the 
host-microbiota interface has gained relevance in understanding the development 
of many non-communicable chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, 
cancer, autoimmunity and neurodegeneration. Importantly, dietary fibre (DF) and 
associated compounds digested by the microbiota and their resulting metabolites, 
especially short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), were significantly associated with 
health beneficial effects, such as via proposed anti-inflammatory mechanisms. 
However, SCFA metabolic pathways are not fully understood. Major steps include 
production of SCFA by microbiota, uptake in the colonic epithelium, first-pass 
effects at the liver, followed by biodistribution and metabolism at the host's 
cellular level. As dietary patterns do not affect all individuals equally, the 
host genetic makeup may play a role in the metabolic fate of these metabolites, 
in addition to other factors that might influence the microbiota, such as age, 
birth through caesarean, medication intake, alcohol and tobacco consumption, 
pathogen exposure and physical activity. In this article, we review the 
metabolic pathways of DF, from intake to the intracellular metabolism of 
fibre-derived products, and identify possible sources of inter-individual 
variability related to genetic variation. Such variability may be indicative of 
the phenotypic flexibility in response to diet, and may be predictive of 
long-term adaptations to dietary factors, including maladaptation and tissue 
damage, which may develop into disease in individuals with specific 
predispositions, thus allowing for a better prediction of potential health 
effects following personalized intervention with DF."
1408,"Introduction: Medium-chain fatty acids contain 6-12 carbon atoms and are 
absorbed directly into the blood vessels, proceeding to the portal vein and, 
finally, to the liver, where they are immediately utilized for energy. We aimed 
to determine the medium-chain fatty acid levels in women with and without breast 
cancer. Materials and Methods: A total of 200 women (100 breast cancer subjects 
and 100 control subjects) were recruited for the study as per the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Blood samples were collected for biochemical estimations. 
Fatty acid methyl esters were isolated, and medium-chain fatty acid levels in 
plasma were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC-FID). Statistical analysis was 
performed using SPSS 20.0 software; p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. Results: The fatty acid analysis revealed a significant decrease in 
the levels of caprylic acid (C:8) and lauric acid (C:12) and a significant 
increase in the level of capric acid (C:10) in the breast cancer subjects when 
compared to the control group. The level of caproic acid (C:6) was not 
significantly increased in the breast cancer subjects. In particular, the HER2- 
and ER-positive breast cancer subjects showed a decrease in their caprylic acid 
and lauric acid levels compared to other receptors. Conclusions: The results of 
the current study imply that lower levels of caprylic and lauric acid may be 
associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. The relevance of medium-chain 
fatty acids for preventive and therapeutic interventions will be amplified by 
further research on the possibility that alteration in a patient's medium-chain 
fatty acid composition may mechanistically contribute to disease progression or 
breast cancer risk."
1409,"The association between intakes of riboflavin and mortality has not been 
examined intensively in general populations. In this study, 10,480 adults in the 
2005-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were 
followed-up until 2019 for their vital status. Riboflavin and folate were 
assessed by two-day 24 h recall. The date and cause of death were obtained from 
the US Mortality Registry. The risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) mortality were investigated using a Cox regression analysis. 
During a mean of 8.5 years follow-up, there were 1214 deaths registered 
(including 373 deaths from CVD and 302 from cancer). Compared to low level 
(quartile 1, Q1) of riboflavin intake, the hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence 
interval (CI)) for high level (quartile 4, Q4) were 0.53 (0.31-0.90) for CVD 
mortality and 0.62 (0.48-0.81) for all-cause mortality. The inverse association 
between riboflavin intake and CVD mortality was only significant among those 
with a high intake of folate (p for interaction 0.045). Those with a high folate 
intake (Q4) and low intake of riboflavin (Q1) had the highest risk of CVD 
mortality (HR 4.38, 95% CI 1.79-10.72), as compared with a high intake of both 
riboflavin and folate. In conclusion, riboflavin intake was inversely associated 
with all-cause mortality and CVD mortality, and the association was modified by 
folate intake."
1410,"Over recent years, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most 
common liver disorder in the developed world, accounting for 20% to 46% of liver 
abnormalities. Steatosis is the hallmark of NAFLD and is recognized as an 
important risk factor for complication and death after general surgery, even 
more so after liver resection. Similarly, liver steatosis also impacts the 
safety of live liver donation and transplantation. We aim to review surgical 
outcomes after liver resection for colorectal metastases in patients with 
steatosis and discuss the most common pre-operative strategies to reduce 
steatosis. Finally, as illustration, we report the favorable effect of a 
low-caloric, hyper-protein diet during a two-stage liver resection for 
colorectal metastases in a patient with severe steatosis."
1411,"BACKGROUND: There are still open questions with respect to the optimal dietary 
treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coexisting non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH). The aim of this study is to investigate, in patients 
with T2D, the association between NASH, dietary component intake, food groups 
and adherence to the Mediterranean diet.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 2026 people with T2D (1136 men and 890 
women). The dietary habits were assessed with the European Prospective 
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) questionnaire. NASH was 
identified by the Index Of NASH (ION). Based on the cluster analysis two dietary 
patterns were identified: the NASH and the NO-NASH pattern.
RESULTS: The macronutrient composition of the diet was similar in the two 
patterns. However, the NASH pattern compared with the NO-NASH pattern was 
characterized by a significantly lower content of fibre (p &lt; 0.001), 
β-carotene (p &lt; 0.001), vitamin C (p &lt; 0.001), vitamin E (p &lt; 0.001), 
polyphenols (p = 0.026) and antioxidant capacity (p &lt; 0.001). With regard to 
food consumption, the NASH pattern compared with NO-NASH pattern was 
characterized by higher intake of rice (p = 0.021), potatoes (p = 0.013), red (p 
= 0.004) and processed meat (p = 0.003), and a lower intake of wholegrain bread 
(p = 0.019), legumes and nuts (p = 0.049), vegetables (p = 0.047), fruits (p = 
0.002), white meat (p = 0.001), fatty fish (p = 0.005), milk and yogurt (p &lt; 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: NO-NASH dietary pattern was characterized by a food consumption 
close to the Mediterranean dietary model, resulting in a higher content of 
polyphenols, vitamins, and fibre. These finding highlight the potential for 
dietary components in the prevention/treatment of NASH in people with T2D."
1412,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epidemiological evidence has shown the association between 
nutritional habits and liver disease. However, results remain conflicting. This 
study investigated the influence of dietary factors on the risk of incident 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cirrhosis, and liver cancer.
METHODS: Data from the UK Biobank database were analyzed (n = 372,492). 
According to baseline data from the food frequency questionnaire, two main 
dietary patterns (Western and prudent) were identified using principal component 
analysis. We used cox proportional hazards models to explore the associations of 
individual food groups and dietary patterns with NAFLD, cirrhosis, and liver 
cancer.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12 years, 3527 hospitalized NAFLD, 1643 
cirrhosis, and 669 liver cancer cases were recorded among 372,492 participants 
without prior history of cancer or chronic liver diseases at baseline. In 
multivariable adjusted analysis, participants in the high tertile of Western 
dietary pattern score had an 18% (95%CI = 1.09-1.29), 21% (95%CI = 1.07-1.37), 
and 24% (95%CI = 1.02-1.50) higher risk of incident NAFLD, liver cirrhosis, and 
liver cancer, respectively, compared with the low tertile. Participants in the 
high tertile of prudent scores had a 15% (95%CI = 0.75-0.96) lower risk of 
cirrhosis, as compared with those in the low tertile. In addition, the higher 
consumption of red meat and the lower consumption of fruit, cereal, tea, and 
dietary fiber were significantly associated with a higher risk of NAFLD, 
cirrhosis, and liver cancer (ptrend &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This large prospective cohort study showed that an increased intake 
of food from the Western dietary pattern could be correlated with an increased 
risk of chronic liver diseases, while the prudent pattern was only correlated 
with a reduced liver cirrhosis risk. These data may provide new insights into 
lifestyle interventions for the prevention of chronical liver diseases."
1413,"The nutritional status in cancer patients is related to cancer survival and 
surgical outcome. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship 
between preoperative prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and post-operative 
clinical outcomes in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. A total of 1282 head 
and neck cancer patients receiving surgical resection in Changhua Christian 
Hospital between 1 January 2010 and 30 August 2021 were recruited in the final 
analysis after undergoing propensity score matching analysis. The logistic 
regression model was used to assess the association of the PNI group with 
overall and various complications. The patients in the high PNI group had a 
significant lower incidence of overall complications, medical complications, and 
pulmonary complications; but not significant surgical complications. The high 
PNI group had lower mortality risk. The results in this study revealed that PNI 
score was a significant independent predictor of postoperative complications in 
HNC patients undergoing surgical resection. We recommend preoperative testing 
and evaluation of HNC patients to identify low PNI and high-risk groups for 
postoperative surveillance."
1414,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common and deadliest malignancy among 
women. High mammographic breast density (MBD) is an established modifiable risk 
marker for BC, and it is of interest, for prevention purposes, to consider 
lifestyle factors that may modulate both MBD and BC risk. Here, we conducted a 
systematic review of the most up-to-date evidence on the association between 
diet as a whole and MBD.
METHODS: We considered as eligible for inclusion in our review (PROSPERO 
registration code CRD42022335289) the studies published until 31 December 2021, 
that reported on the association between a priori or a posteriori dietary 
patterns (in observational studies) or dietary interventions (in randomized 
controlled trials) and MBD.
RESULTS: In total, twelve studies were included. MBD tended to be inversely 
associated with adherence to dietary patterns characterized by high consumption 
of plant-based foods and low in meat, animal fats, and alcohol, defined both a 
priori (e.g., Mediterranean diet and WCRF/AICR guidelines) or a posteriori 
(e.g., ""fruit-vegetable-cereal"" and ""salad-sauce-pasta/grains"" patterns). 
Findings from intervention studies were in fair agreement with those from 
observational studies.
CONCLUSIONS: While further studies are needed, we found suggestive evidence that 
the adoption of a healthy diet is associated with lower MBD."
1415,"We aimed to evaluate the association between three previously defined 
pro-vegetarian (PVG) food patterns and the cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, 
and pancreas in a multi case-control study. We analyzed data from a multi-case 
hospital-based study carried out in two Mediterranean provinces in Spain. A 
total of 1233 participants were included in the analyses: 778 incident cancer 
cases, histologically confirmed (199 oesophagus, 414 stomach, and 165 pancreas) 
and 455 controls. A dietary assessment was performed using a validated food 
frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Three PVG food patterns (general, healthful, and 
unhealthful) were estimated using 12 food groups for the general PVG (gPVG), 
scoring positive plant-based foods and negative animal-based foods, and 18 food 
groups, for the healthful (hPVG) and unhealthful (uPVG) food patterns. 
Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate relative risk ratios (RRR) 
and confidence intervals (95% CI) for quintiles of adherence to PVG patterns and 
as a continuous variable. The RRR (95% CI) for the highest vs. the lowest 
quintile of gPVG were, RRR = 0.37 (0.32, 0.42) for the oesophagus, RRR = 0.34 
(0.27, 0.43) for the stomach, and RRR = 0.43 (0.35, 0.52) for pancreas cancer. 
For the hPVG, the RRR were RRR = 0.72 (0.58, 0.90) for the oesophagus, RRR = 
0.42 (0.34, 0.52) for the stomach, and RRR = 0.74 (0.59, 0.92) for pancreas 
cancer. The uPVG was associated with a higher risk of stomach cancer RRR = 1.76 
(1.42, 2.18). Higher adherence to gPVG and hPVG food patterns is associated with 
a lower risk of oesophageal, stomach, and pancreas cancers, while a higher 
adherence to a uPVG food pattern is associated with a higher risk of stomach 
cancer."
1416,"Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common endocrine disorder associated with 
metabolic abnormalities and gut microbiota dysbiosis. The deficiency of dietary 
fiber, a crucial nutrient in the daily diet, is also associated with a wide 
range of metabolic and reproductive abnormalities, as well as an altered gut 
microbial ecosystem. This study is a meta-analysis to summarize the available 
evidence on the dietary fiber intake level in PCOS patients. Databases of 
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov were 
searched for observational studies, and 13 studies were finally included. The 
pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with the 95% confidence interval (CI) 
of daily dietary fiber intake and total energy intake were calculated using the 
random-effects model. The pooled result (12 studies) on absolute dietary fiber 
intake showed that while there was no significant difference in the total energy 
intake [-0.17 (-0.44, 0.09), p = 0.208], the dietary fiber intake was 
significantly lower in PCOS women than those of controls [-0.32 (-0.50, -0.14), 
p &lt; 0.001]. However, significant heterogeneity was detected across the 
studies (I2 = 65.6%, p = 0.001). Meta-regression suggested that geographic 
region and dietary assessment method may confer borderline significance of 
influence on the heterogeneity. The pooled result (two studies) on dietary fiber 
intake which adjusted for total energy intake, however, showed no significant 
difference [-2.11 (-4.77, 0.56), p = 0.122]. In subgroup analyses based on 
absolute dietary fiber intake, a lower dietary fiber intake in PCOS was observed 
in studies conducted in Asia, adopted food diary or records or food recall as 
the dietary assessment method, had a case-control study design, or used 
Rotterdam criteria for PCOS diagnosis. The difference in SMD was still 
significant in the adult subgroup or in studies matched or unmatched for age."
1417,"Gastric cancer is a common malignant tumor worldwide. 
N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitroguanidine (MNNG) is one of the most important inducing 
factors of gastric cancer. Autophagy can affect the occurrence and development 
of gastric cancer, but the mechanism is not clear. Chemoprevention has been 
shown to be a rational and very promising approach to the prevention of gastric 
cancer. Hesperidin is a citrus flavone, an abundant polyphenol in citrus fruits 
and traditional Chinese medicine. It has an excellent phytochemistry that plays 
an intervention role in gastric cancer. However, it is unclear whether long-term 
exposure to MNNG will affect the occurrence of gastric cancer by regulating 
autophagy and whether hesperidin can play an intervention role in this process. 
In the present study, we demonstrated that long-term MNNG exposure inhibits 
autophagy in stomach tissues of rats, promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) process and cell proliferation and suppresses the activity of 
the PI3K/AKT pathway. We further found that after rapamycin-activated autophagy, 
long-term MNNG exposure promoted cell proliferation and EMT were inhibited. In 
addition, hesperidin promotes autophagy and the activity of the PI3K/AKT 
pathway, as well as the suppression of proliferation and EMT in the stomach 
tissues of rats. Our findings indicate that hesperidin reverses MNNG-induced 
gastric cancer by activating autophagy and the PI3K/AKT pathway, which may 
provide a new basis for the early prevention and treatment of MNNG-induced 
gastric cancer."
1418,"Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) are major postoperative complications 
(POCs) following distal pancreatectomy (DP). Notably, POPF may worsen the 
prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. Previously reported risks for POCs 
include body mass index, pancreatic texture, and albumin levels. Moreover, the 
C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) is a valuable parameter for 
prognostication. On the other hand, POCs sometimes lead to a worse prognosis in 
several cancer types. Thus, we assumed that CAR could be a risk factor for 
POPFs. This study investigated whether CAR can predict POPF risk in patients 
with pancreatic cancer following DP. This retrospective study included 72 
patients who underwent DP for pancreatic cancer at Ehime University between 
January 2009 and August 2022. All patients underwent preoperative CAR screening. 
Risk factors for POPF were analyzed. POPF were observed in 17 of 72 (23.6%) 
patients. POPF were significantly associated with a higher CAR (p = 0.001). The 
receiver operating characteristic curve analysis determined the cutoff value for 
CAR to be 0.05 (sensitivity: 76.5%, specificity: 88.9%, likelihood ratio: 6.88), 
indicating an increased POPF risk. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed 
that CAR ≥ 0.05 was a statistically independent factor for POPF (p &lt; 0.001, p 
= 0.013). Therefore, CAR has the potential to predict POPF following DP."
1419,"Black raspberries (BRB) are rich in anthocyanins with purported 
anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is not known whether dietary 
supplementation would ameliorate Western-diet enhanced gut inflammation and 
colon tumorigenesis. We employed a mouse model of colitis-associated colorectal 
cancer (CAC) to determine the effects of dietary supplementation with 5 to 10% 
(w/w) whole, freeze-dried BRB in male C57BL/6J mice fed either a standard 
healthy diet (AIN93G) or the total Western diet (TWD). In a pilot study, BRB 
suppressed colitis and colon tumorigenesis while also shifting the composition 
of the fecal microbiome in favor of taxa with purported health benefits, 
including Bifidobacterium pseudolongum. In a follow-up experiment using a 2 × 2 
factorial design with AIN and TWD basal diets with and without 10% (w/w) BRB, 
supplementation with BRB reduced tumor multiplicity and increased colon length, 
irrespective of the basal diet, but it did not apparently affect colitis 
symptoms, colon inflammation or mucosal injury based on histopathological 
findings. However, BRB intake increased alpha diversity, altered beta diversity 
and changed the relative abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae, 
Streptococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Akkermansiaceae, among 
others, of the fecal microbiome. Notably, changes in microbiome profiles were 
inconsistent with respect to the basal diet consumed. Overall, these studies 
provide equivocal evidence for in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of BRB on 
colitis and colon tumorigenesis; yet, BRB supplementation led to dynamic changes 
in the fecal microbiome composition over the course of disease development."
1420,"Cervical cancer affects many women worldwide, with more than 500,000 cases 
diagnosed and approximately 300,000 deaths each year. Resveratrol is a natural 
substance of the class of phytoalexins with a basic structure of stilbenes and 
has recently drawn scientific attention due to its anticancer properties. The 
purpose of this review is to examine the effectiveness of resveratrol against 
cervical cancer. All available in vitro and in vivo studies on cervical cancer 
were critically reviewed. Many studies utilizing cervical cancer cells in 
culture reported a reduction in proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and induction 
of apoptosis. Apart from apoptosis, induction of autophagy was seen in some 
studies. Importantly, many studies have shown a reduction in the HPV 
oncoproteins E6 and E7 and increased levels of the tumor suppressor p53 with 
resveratrol treatment. A few studies examined the effects of resveratrol 
administration in mice ectopic-xenografted with cervical cancer cells showing 
reduced tumor volume and weight. Overall, the scientific data show that 
resveratrol has the ability to target/inhibit certain signaling molecules (EGFR, 
VEGFR, PKC, JNK, ERK, NF-kB, and STAT3) involved in cervical cancer cell 
proliferation and survival. Further in vivo experiments and clinical studies are 
required to better understand the potential of resveratrol against cervical 
cancer."
1421,"Patients with foregut tumors are at high risk of malnutrition. Nutrition care 
focuses on identifying individuals at risk of malnutrition and optimizing 
nutrient intake to promote the maintenance of body weight and lean body mass. 
This multi-center prospective, longitudinal study audited nutrition care 
practices related to screening for risk of malnutrition (Patient-Generated 
Subjective Global Assessment Short Form; PG-SGA SF), and nutrition interventions 
prescribed (route; adequacy of energy and protein intakes). Audits occurred at 
four time periods: baseline (before treatment) and at 2, 4, and 6 months after 
starting cancer treatment; 170 patients (esophageal (ESO; n = 51); head and neck 
(HN; n = 119)) were enrolled. Nutrition risk (PG-SGA SF score ≥ 4) was prevalent 
at every time period: HN (baseline: 60%; 6 months 66%) and ESO (77%; 72%). Both 
groups had significant (p &lt; 0.001) weight losses over the 6 month audit 
period (HN = 13.2% ESO = 11.4%). Enteral nutrition (EN) was most likely to be 
prescribed at 2 months for HN and at 4 and 6 months for ESO. Target prescribed 
energy and protein intakes were not met with any nutrition intervention; 
although adequacy was highest for those receiving EN. Nutrition care practices 
differed for HN and ESO cancers and there may be time points when additional 
nutrition support is needed."
1422,"Dietary fat intake in the Chinese population has increased. The PURE 
(prospective urban rural epidemiology) study concluded the potential advantage 
of total fat and saturated fats (SFA) over carbohydrates on blood lipids with 
the inaccurate assessment of dietary fats. We investigated the dietary fat 
profile among 48,315 participants (aged 30-70 years, national representative) 
from the China Nutrition and Health Surveillance (2015-2017), determined the 
relationship of various fats with blood lipid biomarkers in the selected 39,115 
participants, and compared the results with the PURE study. Dietary fat intake 
was calculated by using 3 days of 24 h recalls and food inventory. Serum lipid 
biomarkers were assessed at morning fasting state by health professionals. Plant 
fats (21.5% of total energy (TE)) dominated in total fat intake (69.5 g/day, 
35.6% TE), with monounsaturated fats (MUFA) in the largest (13.8% TE) portion 
and plant oils as the major source (43.7%). Two thirds of the population 
consumed more than 30% TE from dietary fats and nearly half more than 35%, while 
26.4% of them exceeded 10% TE from SFA. Total fat was positively associated with 
total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), but also 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and negatively with triglyceride 
(TG)-to-HDL-c ratio (TGHDL) (all p-trend &lt; 0.05). Replacing total fat with 
carbohydrate yielded adverse changes in most biomarkers (higher LDL-c, TG, and 
TGHDL, lower HDL-c, all p &lt; 0.05) when total fat was low (&lt;34.9% TE). 
Regardless of fat intake level, replacing plant fat or polyunsaturated fats 
(PUFA) with carbohydrate yielded the most adverse changes (higher TC, LDL-c, TG, 
TC-to-HDL-c ratio (TCHDL), and TGHDL, but lower HDL-c, all p &lt; 0.01), while 
replacing animal fat/SFA with plant fat/PUFA yielded the most favorable changes 
(lower all biomarkers, all p &lt; 0.01). The results suggested a less harmful 
effect of carbohydrate on blood lipids when total fat was high, and more 
beneficial effect of unsaturated fats, than the PURE. In conclusion, dietary fat 
intake in Chinese adults had reached quite a high level, but with a different 
profile from Western populations. Replacement of SFA (animal fat) with PUFA 
(plant fat) could most effectively improve blood lipids, while replacement with 
carbohydrate could slightly benefit only when total fat was high. The present 
results may be more applicable to the Chinese population than the PURE study."
1423,"Obesity and upper-body fat distribution are independent, cardiometabolic risk 
factors but whether they also display comparable associations with cancer risk 
is unknown. We investigated the causal relationships between body mass index 
(BMI) and BMI-adjusted waist-to-hip ratio (WHRadjBMI) and cancer risk and 
searched for potential drivers linking these traits to carcinogenesis using 
two-sample and multivariable Mendelian randomisation. In women, genetically 
instrumented higher BMI was associated with lower breast (OR = 0.87, 95% CI 
0.81-0.93) and higher endometrial (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.55-1.96) cancer risk 
whilst WHRadjBMI was associated with higher colon cancer risk (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 
1.07-1.42). In men, elevated BMI was associated with lower prostate cancer risk 
(OR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.98). Mechanistically, testosterone and insulin 
mediated 21% and 35%, respectively of the total, genetically determined 
association of BMI with endometrial cancer risk whilst HDL cholesterol and IGF-1 
mediated 40% and 22%, respectively of the association between BMI and breast 
cancer risk. In men, testosterone mediated 21% of the association between BMI 
and prostate cancer risk. Colon cancer aside, the total amount of body fat might 
be more important than its location in modulating cancer susceptibility due to 
differential effects of obesity and fat distribution on adiposity-associated 
cancer drivers."
1424,"Self-completed 24 h dietary recalls (24-HRs) are increasingly used for research 
and national dietary surveillance. It is unclear how difficulties with 
self-completion affect response rates and sample characteristics. This study 
identified factors associated with being unable to self-complete an online 24-HR 
but willing to do so with an interviewer. Baseline 24-HRs from the ASCOT Trial 
were analysed (n = 1224). Adults who had been diagnosed with cancer in the past 
seven years and completed treatment, were invited to self-complete 24-HRs online 
using myfood24®. Non-completers were offered an interviewer-administered 24-HR. 
One third of participants willing to provide dietary data, were unable to 
self-complete a 24-HR. This was associated with being older, non-white and not 
educated to degree level. Compared to interviewer-administered 24-HRs, 
self-completed 24-HRs included 25% fewer items and reported lower intakes of 
energy, fat, saturated fat and sugar. This study highlights how collection of 
dietary data via online self-completed 24-HRs, without the provision of an 
alternative method, contributes to sampling bias. As dietary surveys are used 
for service and policy planning it is essential to widen inclusion. Optimisation 
of 24-HR tools might increase usability but interviewer-administered 24-HRs may 
be the only suitable option for some individuals."
1425,"The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 9-month intensive lifestyle 
intervention could lead to weight loss and improve cardiovascular risk factors 
among young women with both gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and newly 
diagnosed diabetes. A total of 83 young women, who had GDM and were subsequently 
diagnosed as type 2 diabetes at an average of 2.6 years after delivery, 
participated in a 9-month intensive lifestyle intervention and a follow-up 
survey at 6-9 years postintervention. After the 9-month intervention, these 
women had a weight loss of 2.90 kg (-4.02% of initial weight), decreased waist 
circumference (-3.12 cm), body fat (-1.75%), diastolic blood pressure (-3.49 
mmHg), fasting glucose (-0.98 mmol/L) and HbA1c (-0.72%). During the 6-9 years 
postintervention period, they still had lower weight (-3.71 kg; -4.62% of 
initial weight), decreased waist circumference (-4.56 cm) and body fat (-2.10%), 
but showed a slight increase in HbA1c (0.22%). The prevalence of using 
glucose-lowering agents increased from 2.4% at baseline to 34.6% after the 
9-month lifestyle intervention, and to 48.4% at 6-9 years postintervention. A 
9-month intensive lifestyle intervention can produce beneficial effects on body 
weight, HbA1c and other cardiovascular risk factors among young women with 
previous GDM who subsequently developed new diabetes."
1426,"The biological actions of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) have been investigated 
intensively for over 100 years and has led to the identification of significant 
insights into the repertoire of its biological actions. These were initially 
established to be centered on the regulation of calcium transport in the colon 
and deposition in bone. Beyond these well-known calcemic roles, other roles have 
emerged in the regulation of cell differentiation processes and have an impact 
on metabolism. The purpose of the current review is to consider where applying 
systems biology (SB) approaches may begin to generate a more precise 
understanding of where the VDR is, and is not, biologically impactful. Two SB 
approaches have been developed and begun to reveal insight into VDR biological 
functions. In a top-down SB approach genome-wide scale data are statistically 
analyzed, and from which a role for the VDR emerges in terms of being a hub in a 
biological network. Such approaches have confirmed significant roles, for 
example, in myeloid differentiation and the control of inflammation and innate 
immunity. In a bottom-up SB approach, current biological understanding is built 
into a kinetic model which is then applied to existing biological data to 
explain the function and identify unknown behavior. To date, this has not been 
applied to the VDR, but has to the related ERα and identified previously unknown 
mechanisms of control. One arena where applying top-down and bottom-up SB 
approaches may be informative is in the setting of prostate cancer health 
disparities."
1427,"Current research into the role of engineered nanoparticles in drug delivery 
systems (DDSs) for medical purposes has developed numerous fascinating 
nanocarriers. This paper reviews the various conventionally used and current 
used carriage system to deliver drugs. Due to numerous drawbacks of conventional 
DDSs, nanocarriers have gained immense interest. Nanocarriers like polymeric 
nanoparticles, mesoporous nanoparticles, nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes, 
dendrimers, liposomes, metallic nanoparticles, nanomedicine, and engineered 
nanomaterials are used as carriage systems for targeted delivery at specific 
sites of affected areas in the body. Nanomedicine has rapidly grown to treat 
certain diseases like brain cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, cardiovascular 
diseases, and many others. These nanomedicines can improve drug bioavailability 
and drug absorption time, reduce release time, eliminate drug aggregation, and 
enhance drug solubility in the blood. Nanomedicine has introduced a new era for 
drug carriage by refining the therapeutic directories of the energetic 
pharmaceutical elements engineered within nanoparticles. In this context, the 
vital information on engineered nanoparticles was reviewed and conferred towards 
the role in drug carriage systems to treat many ailments. All these nanocarriers 
were tested in vitro and in vivo. In the coming years, nanomedicines can improve 
human health more effectively by adding more advanced techniques into the drug 
delivery system."
1428,"Ascorbic acid (AA) is an important biomolecule, the deficiency or maladjustment 
of which is associated with the symptoms of many diseases (e.g., cardiovascular 
disease or cancer). Therefore, there is a need to develop a fluorescent probe 
capable of detecting AA in aqueous media. Here, we report the synthesis, 
structural, and spectroscopic characterization (by means of, e.g., XRD, XPS, IR 
and Raman spectroscopy, TG, SEM, and EDS analyses), as well as the 
photoluminescent properties of a metal-organic framework (MOF) based on Cu2+ and 
Eu3+ ions. The ion-exchange process of the extraframework cation in anionic 
Cu-based MOF is proposed as an appropriate strategy to obtain a new material 
with a nondisturbed structure and a sensitivity to interaction with AA. 
Accordingly, a novel Eu[Cu3(μ3-OH)(μ3-4-carboxypyrazolato)3] compound for the 
selective optical detection of AA with a short detection time of 5 min is 
described."
1429,"Just-in-time evaluation of drug resistance in situ will greatly facilitate the 
achievement of precision cancer therapy. The rapid elevation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) is the key to chemotherapy. Hence, suppressed ROS production is an 
important marker for chemotherapy drug resistance. Herein, a NIR-II emission 
smart nanoprobe (LnNP@ZIF8, consisting of a lanthanide-doped nanoparticle (LnNP) 
core and metal-organic framework shell (ZIF8)) is constructed for drug delivery 
and in vivo NIR-II ratiometric imaging of ROS for tumor drug resistance 
evaluation. The drug-loaded nanoprobes release therapeutic substances for 
chemotherapy in the acidic tumor tissue. As the level of ROS increases, the 
LnNPs shows responsively descending fluorescence intensity at 1550 nm excited by 
980 nm (F1550, 980Ex), while the fluorescence of the LnNPs at 1060 nm excited by 
808 nm (F1060, 808Ex) is stable. Due to the ratiometric F1550, 980Ex/F1060, 
808Ex value exhibiting a linear relationship with ROS concentration, NIR-II 
imaging results of ROS change based on this ratio can be an important basis for 
determining tumor drug resistance. As the chemotherapy and resistance evaluation 
are explored continuously in situ, the ratiometric imaging identifies drug 
resistance successfully within 24 h, which can greatly improve the timeliness of 
accurate treatment."
1430,"Metal nanoparticles are effective radiosensitizers that locally enhance 
radiation doses in targeted cancer cells. Compared with other metal 
nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles (GNPs) exhibit high biocompatibility, low 
toxicity, and they increase secondary electron scatter. Herein, we investigated 
the effects of active-targeting GNPs on the radiation-induced bystander effect 
(RIBE) in prostate cancer cells. The impact of GNPs on the RIBE presents 
implications for secondary cancers or spatially fractionated radiotherapy 
treatments. Anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibodies were 
conjugated with PEGylated GNPs through EDC-NHS chemistry. The media transfer 
technique was performed to induce the RIBE on the non-irradiated bystander 
cells. This study focused on the LNCaP cell line, because it can model a wide 
range of stages relating to prostate cancer progression, including the 
transition from androgen dependence to castration resistance and bone 
metastasis. First, LNCaP cells were pretreated with phosphate buffered saline 
(PBS) or PSMA-targeted GNPs (PGNPs) for 24 h and irradiated with 160 kVp X-rays 
(0-8 Gy). Following that, the collected culture media were filtered (sterile 
0.45 µm polyethersulfone) in order to acquire PBS- and PGNP- conditioned media 
(CM). Then, PBS- and PGNP-CM were transferred to the bystander cells that were 
loaded with/without PGNPs. MTT, γ-H2AX, clonogenic assays and reactive oxygen 
species assessments were performed to compare RIBE responses under different 
treatments. Compared with 2 Gy-PBS-CM, 8 Gy-PBS-CM demonstrated a much higher 
RIBE response, thus validating the dose dependence of RIBE in LNCaP cells. 
Compared with PBS-CM, PGNP-CM exhibited lower cell viability, higher DNA damage, 
and a smaller survival fraction. In the presence of PBS-CM, bystander cells 
loaded with PGNPs showed increased cell death compared with cells that did not 
have PGNPs. These results demonstrate the PGNP-boosted expression and 
sensitivity of RIBE in prostate cancer cells."
1431,"The use of gold nanoparticles for drug delivery, photothermal or photodynamic 
therapy, and biosensing enhances the demand for knowledge about the protein 
corona formed on the surface of nanoparticles. In this study, gold nanospheres 
(AuNSs), gold nanorods (AuNRs), and gold nanoflowers (AuNFs) were incubated with 
saliva or urine. After the interaction, the surface of gold nanoparticles was 
investigated using UV-VIS spectroscopy, zeta potential, and dynamic light 
scattering. The shifting of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) band, 
the increase in hydrodynamic diameter, and the changes in the surface charge of 
nanoparticles indicated the presence of biomolecules on the surface of AuNSs, 
AuNRs, and AuNFs. The incubation of AuNFs with saliva led to nanoparticle 
aggregation and minimal protein adsorption. AuNSs and AuNRs incubated in saliva 
were analyzed through liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) to identify the 96 proteins adsorbed on the surface of the gold 
nanoparticles. Among the 20 most abundant proteins identified, 14 proteins were 
common in both AuNSs and AuNRs. We hypothesize that the adsorption of these 
proteins was due to their high sulfur content, allowing for their interaction 
with gold nanoparticles via the Au-S bond. The presence of distinct proteins on 
the surface of AuNSs or AuNRs was also investigated and possibly related to the 
competition between proteins present on the external layers of corona and gold 
nanoparticle morphology."
1432,"Recently, the abnormal level of zinc emerged as a powerful indicator or risk 
factor for metabolic, endocrine, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, 
including cancer. Electrochemical detection has been explored to quantify zinc 
in a precise, rapid, and non-expensive way; however, most of the current 
electrochemical systems lack in specificity. In this work we studied a highly 
selective and sensitive electrochemical method to detect quickly and reliably 
free zinc ions (Zn2+). The surface of the working electrode was modified with 
zincon electropolymerized on carbon nanotube (CNT) to enable the binding of zinc 
in complex body fluids. After being physicochemically characterized, the 
performances of the zincon-CNT complex was electrochemically assessed. Square 
Wave Voltammetry (SWV) was used to determine the calibration curve and the 
linear range of zinc quantification in artificial saliva and urine. This zincon- 
CNT system could specifically quantify mobile Zn2+ in salivary and urinary 
matrices with a sensitivity of ~100 ng·mL-1 and a limit of detection (LOD) of 
~20 ng·mL-1. Zincon-modified CNT presented as a desirable candidate for the 
detection and quantification of free zinc in easily body fluids that potentially 
can become a diagnostic non-invasive testing platform."
1433,"Coumarin is an effective treatment for primary lymphoedema, as well as 
lymphoedema related to breast cancer radiotherapy or surgery. However, its 
clinical use is limited in several countries due to the possible occurrence of 
hepatotoxicity, mainly in the form of mild to moderate transaminase elevation. 
It is worth noting that only a few cases of severe hepatotoxicity have been 
described in the literature, with no reported cases of liver failure. Data 
available on coumarin absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion have 
been reviewed, focusing on hepatotoxicity studies carried out in vitro and in 
vivo. Finally, safety and tolerability data from clinical trials have been 
thoroughly discussed. Based on these data, coumarin-induced hepatotoxicity is 
restricted to a small subset of patients, probably due to the activation in 
these individuals of alternative metabolic pathways involving specific CYP450s 
isoforms. The aim of this work is to stimulate research to clearly identify 
patients at risk of developing hepatotoxicity following coumarin treatment. 
Early identification of this subset of patients could open the possibility of 
more safely exploiting the therapeutical properties of coumarin, allowing 
patients suffering from lymphoedema to benefit from the anti-oedematous activity 
of the treatment."
1434,"The neuroprotective properties of ginsenosides have been found to reverse the 
neurological damage caused by oxidation in many neurodegenerative diseases. 
However, the distribution of ginsenosides in different tissues of the main root, 
which was regarded as the primary medicinal portion in clinical practice was 
different, the specific parts and specific components against neural oxidative 
damage were not clear. The present study aims to screen and determine the 
potential compounds in different parts of the main root in ginseng. Comparison 
of the protective effects in the main root, phloem and xylem of ginseng on 
hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death of SH-SY5Y neurons was investigated. 
UPLC-Q-Exactive-MS/MS was used to quickly and comprehensively characterize the 
chemical compositions of the active parts. Network pharmacology combined with a 
molecular docking approach was employed to virtually screen for disease-related 
targets and potential active compounds. By comparing the changes before and 
after Content-Effect weighting, the compounds with stronger anti-nerve oxidative 
damage activity were screened out more accurately. Finally, the activity of the 
selected monomer components was verified. The results suggested that the phloem 
of ginseng was the most effective part. There were 19 effective compounds and 14 
core targets, and enriched signaling pathway and biological functions were 
predicted. After Content-Effect weighting, compounds Ginsenosides F1, 
Ginsenosides Rf, Ginsenosides Rg1 and Ginsenosides Rd were screened out as 
potential active compounds against neural oxidative damage. The activity 
verification study indicated that all four predicted ginsenosides were effective 
in protecting SH-SY5Y cells from oxidative injury. The four compounds can be 
further investigated as potential lead compounds for neurodegenerative diseases. 
This also provides a combined virtual and practical method for the simple and 
rapid screening of active ingredients in natural products."
1435,"The goal of this study was to determine the activity in vitro and in vivo of 
avarol, a sesquiterpene hydroquinone originating from the Dysidea avara sponge 
from the south Adriatic Sea, against different cancer cell lines and two types 
of mouse carcinoma. To investigate the in vitro cytotoxicity, a human cervix 
adenocarcinoma cell line (HeLa), human colon adenocarcinoma (LS174), human 
non-small-cell lung carcinoma (A549), and a normal human fetal lung fibroblast 
cell line (MRC-5) were used. The in vivo antitumor activity was investigated 
against two transplantable mouse tumors, the Ehrlich carcinoma (EC) and cervical 
cancer (CC-5). The effect of avarol on cancer cell survival, which was 
determined by the microculture tetrazolium test, confirmed a significant in 
vitro potency of avarol against the investigated cell lines, without selectivity 
towards MRC-5. The highest cytotoxicity was exhibited against HeLa cancer cells 
(10.22 ± 0.28 μg/mL). Moreover, potent antitumor activity against two tumor 
models was determined, as the intraperitoneal administration of avarol at a dose 
of 50 mg/kg resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth in mice. After 
three administrations of avarol, a 29% inhibition of the EC growth was achieved, 
while in the case of CC-5, a 36% inhibition of the tumor growth was achieved 
after the second administration of avarol. Therefore, the results indicate that 
this marine sesquiterpenoid hydroquinone could be a promising bioactive compound 
in the development of new anticancer medicine."
1436,"The incidence of colon cancer is increasing year over year, seriously affecting 
human health and quality of life in recent years. However, traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM) has been utilized for the treatment of colon cancer. S. 
officinalis Saponins (S-Saponins), the potential compound of TCM, displays 
multiple biological activities in colon cancer treatment. In our study, 
ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(UHPLC-MS/MS) combined with multivariate statistical analysis were performed to 
analyze and identify raw and processed saponins. Then, MTT and cell migration 
assays were used to preliminarily explore the effects of saponins in vitro on 
colon cancer cells. The results showed that 29 differential saponins compounds 
under Paozhi were identified by UHPLC-MS/MS. Moreover, in vitro validation 
showed that Sprocessed better inhibited the proliferation and migration of colon 
cancer cells than Sraw. This study provides a basis for the determination of the 
chemical fundamentals of the efficacy changes during Paozhi through inferring 
the changes in saponin components and its possible transformation mechanisms 
before and after processing S. officinalis. Meanwhile, it also provides new

1437,"COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has spawned a 
worldwide pandemic. ADAM17 is a sheddase associated with the modulation of the 
receptor ACE2 of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have revealed that malignant phenotypes of 
several cancer types are closely relevant to highly expressed ADAM17. However, 
ADAM17 regulation in SARS-CoV-2 invasion and its role on small molecules are 
unclear. Here, we evaluated the ADAM17 inhibitory effects of cordycepin (CD), 
thymoquinone (TQ), and N6, N6-dimethyladenosine (m62A), on cancer cells and 
predicted the anti-COVID-19 potential of the three compounds and their 
underlying signaling pathways by network pharmacology. It was found that CD, TQ, 
and m62A repressed the ADAM17 expression upon different cancer cells remarkably. 
Moreover, CD inhibited GFP-positive syncytia formation significantly, suggesting 
its potential against SARS-CoV-2. Pharmacological analysis by constructing CD-, 
TQ-, and m62A-based drug-target COVID-19 networks further indicated that ADAM17 
is a potential target for anti-COVID-19 therapy with these compounds, and the 
mechanism might be relevant to viral infection and transmembrane 
receptors-mediated signal transduction. These findings imply that ADAM17 is of 
potentially medical significance for cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, 
which provides potential new targets and insights for developing innovative 
drugs against COVID-19."
1438,"Vandetanib (Caprelsa®; VNB) is a prescription medicine that is used for the 
treatment of medullary thyroid cancer that has disrupted other body parts or 
that cannot be removed by surgery. It is considered a tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI). Fast, sensitive and validated HPLC-UV was established for VNB 
quantification in pure human biological fluids (urine and plasma) and human 
liver microsomes (HLMs). This analytical methodology was applied also to the 
metabolic stability assessment of VNB. This method was performed using a phenyl 
column (250 mm × 4.6 mm id, 5 µm particle size). A sodium dodecyl sulphate 
solution (0.05 M, pH 3.0 using 0.02 M orthophosphoric acid) containing 0.3% 
triethylamine and 10% n-butanol was used as a mobile phase and was pumped 
isocratically at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min and at a 260 nm detection wavelength. 
The total elution time was 6 min with an injection volume of 20 μL. The 
linearity of the established methodology ranged from 30 to 500 ng/mL in pure 
form and 50 to 500 ng/mL (r2 ≥ 0.9994) in human biological fluids and HLMs. No 
significant interference from the matrix components was observed. The proposed 
methodology revealed the benefits of being green, reliable and economic."
1439,"Among all legumes sprouts' active compounds, isoflavones seem to be the most 
important; nevertheless, their high content is not always associated with 
beneficial effects. These compounds may prevent or stimulate hormone-dependent 
cancers due to their estrogen-like activity. Different LED light quality can 
change the synthesis of active compounds and significantly influence the 
biological activity of the sprouts. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of 
LED light (red, blue, green, yellow), as well as total darkness, and natural 
light conditions (as reference), on isoflavones content, determined by 
HPLC-UV-VIS, during 10 days of harvesting of chickpea and lupin sprouts. Due to 
the ambiguous estrogenic potential of isoflavones, the impact of these sprouts 
on normal and cancer prostate and breast cells was evaluated. Yellow LED light 
resulted in the highest sum of isoflavones in chickpea sprouts (up to 1 g/100 g 
dw), while for green LED light, the isoflavones sum was the lowest. The exact 
opposite effect was noted for lupin sprouts, with the predominance of green over 
the yellow LED light. The examined sprouts were of high safety to non-neoplastic 
breast and prostate cells, with interesting cytotoxic effects on breast MCF7 and 
prostate DU145 cancer cells. No clear relationship was observed between the 
activity and isoflavones content."
1440,"Sensitive detection methods for T4 polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (T4 PNKPP) 
are urgently required to obtain information on malignancy and thereby to provide 
better guidance in PNKP-related diagnostics and drug screening. Although the 
CRISPR/Cas12a system shows great promise in DNA-based signal amplification 
protocols, its guide RNAs with small molecular weight often suffer nuclease 
degradation during storage and utilization, resulting in reduced activation 
efficiency. Herein, we proposed a self-supplying guide RNA-mediated 
CRISPR/Cas12a system for the sensitive detection of T4 PNKP in cancer cells, in 
which multiple copies of guide RNA were generated by in situ transcription. In 
this assay, T4 PNKP was chosen as a model, and a dsDNA probe with T7 promoter 
region and the transcription region of guide RNA were involved. Under the action 
of T4 PNKP, the 5'-hydroxyl group of the dsDNA probe was converted to a 
phosphate group, which can be recognized and digested by Lambda Exo, resulting 
in dsDNA hydrolysis. The transcription template was destroyed, which resulted in 
the failure to generate guide RNA by the transcription pathway. Therefore, the 
CRISPR/Cas12a system could not be activated to effectively cleavage the 
F-Q-reporter, and the fluorescence signal was turned off. In the absence of T4 
PNKP, the 5'-hydroxyl group of the substrate DNA cannot be digested by Lambda 
Exo. The intact dsDNA acts as the transcription template to generate a large 
amount of guide RNA. Finally, the formed Cas12a/gRNA complex triggered the 
reverse cleavage of Cas12a on the F-Q-reporter, resulting in a ""turn-on"" 
fluorescence signal. This strategy displayed sharp sensitivity of T4 PNKP with 
the limit of detection (LOD) down to 0.0017 mU/mL, which was mainly due to the 
multiple regulation effect of transcription amplification. In our system, the 
dsDNA simultaneously serves as the T4 PNKP substrate, transcription template, 
and Lambda Exo substrate, avoiding the need for multiple probe designs and 
saving costs. By integrating the target recognition, Lambda Exo activity, and 
trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a, CRISPR/Cas12a catalyzed the cleavage of 
fluorescent-labeled short-stranded DNA probes and enabled synergetic signal 
amplification for sensitive T4 PNKP detection. Furthermore, the T4 PNKP in 
cancer cells has been evaluated as a powerful tool for biomedical research and 
clinical diagnosis, proving a good practical application capacity."
1441,"BACKGROUND: Surgically induced nerve damage is a common but debilitating side 
effect. By developing tracers that specifically target the most abundant protein 
in peripheral myelin, namely myelin protein zero (P0), we intend to support 
fluorescence-guided nerve-sparing surgery. To that end, we aimed to develop a 
dimeric tracer that shows a superior affinity for P0.
METHODS: Following truncation of homotypic P0 protein-based peptide sequences 
and fluorescence labeling, the lead compound Cy5-P0101-125 was selected. Using a 
bifunctional fluorescent dye, the dimeric Cy5-(P0101-125)2 was created. 
Assessment of the performance of the mono- and bi-labeled compounds was based on 
(photo)physical evaluation. This was followed by in vitro assessment in P0 
expressing Schwannoma cell cultures by means of fluorescence confocal imaging 
(specificity, location of binding) and flow cytometry (binding affinity; KD).
RESULTS: Dimerization resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in affinity compared to 
the mono-labeled counterpart (70.3 +/- 10.0 nM vs. 104.9 +/- 16.7 nM; p = 0.003) 
which resulted in a 4-fold increase in staining efficiency in P0 expressing 
Schwannoma cells. Presence of two targeting vectors also improves a 
pharmacokinetics of labeled compounds by lowering serum binding and optical 
stability by preventing dye stacking.
CONCLUSIONS: Dimerization of the nerve-targeting peptide P0101-125 proves a 
valid strategy to improve P0 targeting."
1442,"Cancer is a main culprit and the second-leading cause of death worldwide. The 
current mode of treatment strategies including surgery with chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy may be effective, but cancer is still considered a major cause 
of death. Plant-derived products or their purified bioactive compounds have 
confirmed health-promoting effects as well as cancer-preventive effects. Among 
these products, flavonoids belong to polyphenols, chiefly found in fruits, 
vegetables and in various seeds/flowers. It has been considered to be an 
effective antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and to play a vital role in diseases 
management. Besides these activities, flavonoids have been revealed to possess 
anticancer potential through the modulation of various cell signaling molecules. 
In this regard, fisetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has a confirmed role 
in disease management through antioxidant, neuro-protective, anti-diabetic, 
hepato-protective and reno-protective potential. As well, its cancer-preventive 
effects have been confirmed via modulating various cell signaling pathways 
including inflammation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, growth factor, transcription 
factor and other cell signaling pathways. This review presents an overview of 
the anti-cancer potential of fisetin in different types of cancer through the 
modulation of cell signaling pathways based on in vivo and in vitro studies. A 
synergistic effect with anticancer drugs and strategies to improve the 
bioavailability are described. More clinical trials need to be performed to 
explore the anti-cancer potential and mechanism-of-action of fisetin and its 
optimum therapeutic dose."
1443,"This study aimed to establish the phytochemical profile of 
Glochidion&amp;nbsp;velutinum and its cytotoxic activity against prostate cancer 
(PC-3) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. The phytochemical composition of G. 
velutinum leaf extract and its fractions was established with the help of total 
phenolic and flavonoid contents and LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics analysis. The 
crude methanolic extract and its fractions were studied for pharmacological 
activity against PC-3 and MCF-7 cell lines using the MTT assay. The total 
phenolic content of the crude extract and its fractions ranged from 44 to 859 µg 
GAE/mg of sample whereas total flavonoid contents ranged from 20 to 315 µg QE/mg 
of sample. A total of forty-eight compounds were tentatively dereplicated in the 
extract and its fractions. These phytochemicals included benzoic acid 
derivatives, flavans, flavones, O-methylated flavonoids, flavonoid O- and 
C-glycosides, pyranocoumarins, hydrolysable tannins, carbohydrate conjugates, 
fatty acids, coumarin glycosides, monoterpenoids, diterpenoids, and terpene 
glycosides. The crude extract (IC50 = 89 µg/mL), the chloroform fraction (IC50 = 
27 µg/mL), and the water fraction (IC50 = 36 µg/mL) were found to be active 
against the PC-3 cell line. However, the crude extract (IC50 = 431 µg/mL), the 
chloroform fraction (IC50 = 222 µg/mL), and the ethyl acetate fraction (IC50 = 
226 µg/mL) have shown prominent activity against breast cancer cells. Moreover, 
G. velutinum extract and its fractions presented negligible toxicity to normal 
macrophages at the maximum tested dose (600 µg/mL). Among the compounds 
identified through LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics analysis, epigallocatechin 
gallate, ellagic acid, isovitexin, and rutin were reported to have anticancer 
activity against both prostate and breast cancer cell lines and might be 
responsible for the cytotoxic activities of G. velutinum extract and its 
bioactive fractions."
1444,"The electrochemical properties of methylisothiazolinone (MIT), the most widely 
used preservative, were investigated by cyclic (CV) and differential pulse 
voltammetry (DPV) to develop a new method for its determination. To our 
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a voltammetric procedure for the 
determination of MIT on a boron-doped diamond electrode (BDDE) in a 
citrate-phosphate buffer (C-PB) environment. The anodic oxidation process of 
methylisothiazolinone, which is the basis of this method, proved to be 
diffusion-controlled and proceeded with an irreversible two-electron exchange. 
The radical cations, as unstable primary products, were converted in subsequent 
chemical reactions to sulfoxides and sulfones, and finally to more stable final 
products. Performed determinations were based on the DPV technique. A linear 
calibration curve was obtained in the concentration range from 0.7 to 18.7 mg 
L-1, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9999. The proposed procedure was 
accurate and precise, allowing the detection of MIT at a concentration level of 
0.24 mg L-1. It successfully demonstrated its suitability for the determination 
of methylisothiazolinone in household products without the need for any 
separation steps. The proposed method can serve as an alternative to the 
prevailing chromatographic determinations of MIT in real samples."
1445,"Lung cancer is one of the 10 most common cancers in the world, which seriously 
affects the normal life and health of patients. According to the investigation 
report, the 3-year survival rate of patients with lung cancer is less than 20%. 
Heredity, the environment, and long-term smoking or secondhand smoke greatly 
promote the development and progress of the disease. The mechanisms of action of 
the occurrence and development of lung cancer have not been fully clarified. As 
a new type of gas signal molecule, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has received great 
attention for its physiological and pathological roles in mammalian cells. It 
has been found that H2S is widely involved in the regulation of the respiratory 
system and digestive system, and plays an important role in the occurrence and 
development of lung cancer. H2S has the characteristics of dissolving in water 
and passing through the cell membrane, and is widely expressed in body tissues, 
which determines the possibility of its participation in the occurrence of lung 
cancer. Both endogenous and exogenous H2S may be involved in the inhibition of 
lung cancer cells by regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism, mitochondrial 
DNA integrity, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B co-pathway 
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). This article reviews and discusses the 
molecular mechanism of H2S in the development of lung cancer, and provides novel 
insights for the prevention and targeted therapy of lung cancer."
1446,"High quality and nutritional benefits are ultimately the desirable features that 
influence the commercial value and market share of broad bean (Vicia faba L.). 
Different cultivars vary greatly in taste, flavor, and nutrition. However, the 
molecular basis of these traits remains largely unknown. Here, the grain 
metabolites of the superior Chinese landrace Cixidabaican (CX) were detected by 
a widely targeted metabolomics approach and compared with the main cultivar 
Lingxiyicun (LX) from Japan. The analyses of global metabolic variations 
revealed a total of 149 differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) were 
identified between these two genotypes. Among them, 84 and 65 were up- and 
down-regulated in CX compared with LX. Most of the DAMs were closely related to 
healthy eating substances known for their antioxidant and anti-cancer 
properties, and some others were involved in the taste formation. The KEGG-based 
classification further revealed that these DAMs were significantly enriched in 
21 metabolic pathways, particularly in flavone and flavonol biosynthesis. The 
differences in key secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, terpenoids, 
amino acid derivates, and alkaloids, may lead to more nutritional value in a 
healthy diet and better adaptability for the seed germination of CX. The present 
results provide important insights into the taste/quality-forming mechanisms and 
contributes to the conservation and utilization of germplasm resources for 
breeding broad bean with superior eating quality."
1447,"Ursolic acid (UA) is a pentacyclic triterpene isolated from a large variety of 
vegetables, fruits and many traditional medicinal plants. It is a structural 
isomer of Oleanolic Acid. The medicinal application of UA has been explored 
extensively over the last two decades. The diverse pharmacological properties of 
UA include anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, 
anti-proliferative, etc. Especially, UA holds a promising position, potentially, 
as a cancer preventive and therapeutic agent due to its relatively non-toxic 
properties against normal cells but its antioxidant and antiproliferative 
activities against cancer cells. Cell culture studies have shown interference of 
UA with multiple pharmacological and molecular targets that play a critical role 
in many cells signaling pathways. Although UA is considered a privileged natural 
product, its clinical applications are limited due to its low absorption through 
the gastro-intestinal track and rapid elimination. The low bioavailability of UA 
limits its use as a therapeutic drug. To overcome these drawbacks and utilize 
the importance of the scaffold, many researchers have been engaged in designing 
and developing synthetic analogs of UA via structural modifications. This 
present review summarizes the synthetic UA analogs and their cytotoxic 
antiproliferative properties reported in the last two decades."
1448,"In silico docking studies of 50 selected compounds from Millettia dielsiana 
Harms ex Diels (family Leguminosae) were docked into the binding pocket of the 
PI3K/mTOR protein. In there, compounds trans-3-O-p-hydroxycinnamoyl ursolic acid 
(1) and 5,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone 
7-O-β-D-apiofuranosyl-(1→6)-β-D-glucopyranoside (2) are predicted to be very 
promising inhibitors against PI3K/mTOR. They direct their cytotoxic activity 
against Hepatocellular carcinoma with binding affinity (BA) values, the pulling 
work spent to the co-crystallized ligand from the binding site of PI3K/mTOR (W 
and Fmax), and the non-equilibrium binding free energy (∆GneqJar) as BA values = 
-9.237 and -9.083 kcal/mol, W = 83.5 ± 10.6 kcal/mol with Fmax = 336.2 ± 45.3 pN 
and 126.6 ± 21.7 kcal/mol with Fmax = 430.3 ± 84.0 pN, and ∆GneqJar = -69.86074 
and -101.2317 kcal/mol, respectively. In molecular dynamic simulation, the RMSD 
value of the PI3K/mTOR complex with compounds (1 and 2) was in the range of 0.3 
nm to the end of the simulation. Therefore, the compounds (1 and 2) are 
predicted to be very promising inhibitors against PI3K/mTOR. The crude extract, 
ethyl acetate fraction and compounds (1 and 2) from Millettia dielsiana 
exhibited moderate to potent in vitro cytotoxicity on Hepatocellular carcinoma 
cell line with IC50 values of 81.2 µg/mL, 60.4 µg/mL, 23.1 μM, and 16.3 μM, 
respectively, and showed relatively potent to potent in vitro antioxidant 
activity on mouse hepatocytes with ED50 values of 24.4 µg/mL, 19.3 µg/mL, 30.7 
μM, and 20.5 μM, respectively. In conclusion, Millettia dielsiana and compounds 
(1 and 2) are predicted to have very promising cytotoxic activity against 
Hepatocellular carcinoma and have a hepatoprotective effect."
1449,"A dysregulation of the cell-death mechanism contributes to poor prognosis in 
lung cancer. New potent chemotherapeutic agents targeting apoptosis-deregulating 
molecules have been discovered. In this study, 22-(4-pyridinecarbonyl) 
jorunnamycin A (22-(4'py)-JA), a synthetic derivative of 
bistetrahydroisoquinolinequinone from the Thai blue sponge, was semisynthesized 
by the Steglich esterification method, and its pharmacological mechanism in 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was elucidated by a network pharmacology 
approach. All predicted targets of 22-(4'py)-JA and genes related to NSCLC were 
retrieved from drug-target and gene databases. A total of 78 core targets were 
identified, and their associations were analyzed by STRING and Cytoscape. Gene 
ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that molecules in 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling were potential targets of 
22-(4'py)-JA in the induction of NSCLC apoptosis. In silico molecular docking 
analysis displayed a possible interaction of ERK1/2 and MEK1 with 22-(4'py)-JA. 
In vitro anticancer activity showed that 22-(4'py)-JA has strong cytotoxic and 
apoptosis-inducing effects in H460, H292 and A549 NSCLC cells. Furthermore, 
immunoblotting confirmed that 22-(4'py)-JA induced apoptotic cell death in an 
ERK/MEK/Bcl-2-dependent manner. The present study demonstrated that 22-(4'py)-JA 
exhibited a potent anticancer effect that could be further developed for 
clinical application and showed that network pharmacology approaches are a 
powerful tool to illustrate the molecular pathways of new drugs or compounds."
1450,"For many patients, diabetes Mellitus and Malignancy are frequently encountered 
comorbidities. Diabetes affects approximately 10.5% of the global population, 
while malignancy accounts for 29.4 million cases each year. These troubling 
statistics indicate that current treatment approaches for these diseases are 
insufficient. Alternative therapeutic strategies that consider unique signaling 
pathways in diabetic and malignancy patients could provide improved therapeutic 
outcomes. The G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is receiving attention 
for its role in disease pathogenesis and treatment outcomes. This review aims to 
critically examine GPER' s comparative role in diabetes mellitus and malignancy, 
identify research gaps that need to be filled, and highlight GPER's potential as 
a therapeutic target for diabetes and malignancy management. There is a scarcity 
of data on GPER expression patterns in diabetic models; however, for diabetes 
mellitus, altered expression of transport and signaling proteins has been linked 
to GPER signaling. In contrast, GPER expression in various malignancy types 
appears to be complex and debatable at the moment. Current data show 
inconclusive patterns of GPER expression in various malignancies, with some 
indicating upregulation and others demonstrating downregulation. Further 
research should be conducted to investigate GPER expression patterns and their 
relationship with signaling pathways in diabetes mellitus and various 
malignancies. We conclude that GPER has therapeutic potential for chronic 
diseases such as diabetes mellitus and malignancy."
1451,"In this study, a marine brown alga Sargassum cristaefolium-derived fungal 
strain, Penicillium sumatraense SC29, was isolated and identified. Column 
chromatography of the extracts from liquid fermented products of the fungal 
strain was carried out and led to the isolation of six compounds. Their 
structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis and supported by 
single-crystal X-ray diffraction as four previously undescribed 
(R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid and glycolic acid derivatives, namely penisterines A 
(1) and C-E (3-5) and penisterine A methyl ether (2), isolated for the first 
time from natural resources, along with (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (6). Of these 
compounds identified, penisterine E (5) was a unique 6/6/6-tricyclic ether with 
an acetal and two hemiketal functionalities. All the isolates were subjected to 
in vitro anti-angiogenic assays using a human endothelial progenitor cell (EPCs) 
platform. Among these, penisterine D (4) inhibited EPC growth, migration, and 
tube formation without any cytotoxic effect. Further, in in vivo bioassays, the 
percentages of angiogenesis of compound 3 on Tg (fli1:EGFP) transgenic zebrafish 
were 54% and 37% as the treated concentration increased from 10.2 to 20.4 µg/mL, 
respectively, and the percentages of angiogenesis of compound 4 were 52% and 41% 
as the treated concentration increased from 8.6 to 17.2 µg/mL, respectively. The 
anti-angiogenic activity of penisterine D (4) makes it an attractive candidate 
for further preclinical investigation."
1452,"Two compounds 1 and 2 were isolated from the culture broth of Lepista luscina. 
This is the first time that compound 1 was isolated from a natural source. The 
structure of compound 1 was identified via 1D and 2D NMR and HRESIMS data. 
Compounds 1 and 2 along with 8-nitrotryptanthrin (4) were evaluated for their 
biological activities using the A549 lung cancer cell line. As a result, 1 and 2 
inhibited the expression of Axl and immune checkpoint molecules. In addition, 
compounds 1, 2 and 4 were tested for HIF inhibitory activity. Compound 2 
demonstrated statistically significant HIF inhibitory effects on NIH3T3 cells 
and 1 and 2 against ARPE19 cells."
1453,"Combating acquired drug resistance of EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK) is a great 
challenge and an urgent necessity in the management of non-small cell lung 
cancers. The advanced EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) triple mutation has been recently 
reported, and there have been no specific drugs approved for this strain. 
Therefore, our research aimed to search for effective agents that could impede 
the function of EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) TK by the integration of in silico and 
in vitro approaches. Our in-house quinoxalinone-containing compounds were 
screened through molecular docking and their biological activity was then 
verified by enzyme- and cell-based assay. We found that the four 
quinoxalinone-containing compounds including CPD4, CPD15, CPD16, and CPD21 were 
promising to be novel EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) TK inhibitors. The IC50 values 
measured by the enzyme-based assay were 3.04 ± 1.24 nM; 6.50 ± 3.02 nM,10.50 ± 
1.10 nM; and 3.81 ± 1.80 nM, respectively, which are at a similar level to a 
reference drug; osimertinib (8.93 ± 3.01 nM). Besides that, they displayed 
cytotoxic effects on a lung cancer cell line (H1975) with IC50 values in the 
range of 3.47 to 79.43 μM. In this proposed study, we found that all screened 
compounds could interact with M793 at the hinge regions and two mutated residues 
including M790 and S797; which may be the main reason supporting the inhibitory 
activity in vitro. The structural dynamics revealed that the screened compounds 
have sufficient non-native contacts with surrounding amino acids and could be 
well-buried in the binding site's cleft. In addition, all predicted 
physicochemical parameters were favorable to be drug-like based on Lipinski's 
rule of five, and no extreme violation of toxicity features was found. 
Altogether, this study proposes a novel EGFR (L858R/T790M/C797S) TK inhibitor 
scaffold and provides a detailed understanding of compounds' recognition and 
susceptibility at the molecular level."
1454,"Plant polyphenols have various health effects. Genistein, which is abundant in 
soybeans, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate, which is abundant in green tea, are 
major flavonoids, a subclass group of polyphenols. Several epidemiological 
studies have shown that these flavonoids have beneficial effects against cancer 
and cardiovascular diseases. However, other studies did not show such effects. 
Several confounding factors, including recall bias, are related to these 
inconsistent findings, and the determination of metabolites in the urine may be 
useful in reducing the number of confounding factors. Equipment, which can be 
used by research participants to collect samples from a portion of voided urine 
within 24 h without the help of medical workers, has been developed for 
epidemiological investigations. Previous studies, in which flavonoid metabolites 
in these urine samples were measured, revealed that soy intake was correlated 
with a reduced risk of certain types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases 
worldwide. Although soybeans and green tea consumption may have protective 
effects against cancer and cardiovascular diseases, further clinical studies 
that consider different confounding factors are required to provide evidence for 
the actual impact of dietary flavonoids on human diseases, including cancer and 
cardiovascular diseases. One possible mechanism involved is discussed in 
relation to the downregulation of reactive oxygen species and the upregulation 
of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase elicited by these 
flavonoids."
1455,"A series of 6- and 6,8-halocoumarin derivatives have been investigated as 
potential antiproliferative compounds against a panel of tumor and normal cell 
lines. Cytotoxic effects were determined by the MTT method. To investigate the 
potential molecular mechanism involved in the cytotoxic effect, apoptosis assay, 
cell cycle analysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reduced glutathione 
analysis were performed. Among the screened compounds, coumarins 
6,8-dibromo-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carbonitrile 2h and 
6,8-diiodo-2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carbonitrile 2k exhibited the most 
antiproliferative effect in thyroid cancer-derived cells TPC-1. The apoptosis 
assay showed that both 2h and 2k induced apoptosis in TPC-1 thyroid cancer 
cells. According to these experiments, both coumarins induced a slight increase 
in TPC-1 cells in the G2/M phase and a decrease in the S phase. A significant 
increase in ROS levels was observed in TPC-1 treated with diiodocoumarin 2k, 
while the dibromocoumarin 2h induced a decrease in ROS in a dose and 
time-dependent manner."
1456,"Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 80% of all bladder 
cancers. Although it is mostly low-grade tumors, its high recurrence rate 
necessitates three-times-monthly follow-ups and cystoscopy examinations to 
detect and prevent its progression. A rapid liquid biopsy-based assay is needed 
to improve detection and reduce complications from invasive cystoscopy. Here, we 
present a rapid spectroscopic method to detect the recurrence of NMIBC in urine. 
Urine samples from previously-diagnosed NMIBC patients (n = 62) were collected 
during their follow-up visits before cystoscopy examination. Cystoscopy results 
were recorded (41 cancer-free and 21 recurrence) and attenuated total refraction 
Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were acquired from urine samples 
using direct application. Spectral processing and normalization were optimized 
using parameter grid searching. We assessed their technical variability through 
multivariate analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). We assessed 35 
machine learning models on a training set (70%), and the performance was 
evaluated on a held-out test set (30%). A Regularized Random Forests (RRF) model 
achieved a 0.92 area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) with 
86% sensitivity and 77% specificity. In conclusion, our spectroscopic liquid 
biopsy approach provides a promising technique for the early identification of 
NMIBC with a less invasive examination."
1457,"Breast cancer (BC), the most common malignancy in women, results from 
significant alterations in genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that alter multiple 
signaling pathways in growth and malignant progression, leading to limited 
long-term survival. Current studies with numerous drug therapies have shown that 
BC is a complex disease with tumor heterogeneity, rapidity, and dynamics of the 
tumor microenvironment that result in resistance to existing therapy. Targeting 
a single cell-signaling pathway is unlikely to treat or prevent BC. Curcumin (a 
natural yellow pigment), the principal ingredient in the spice turmeric, is 
well-documented for its diverse pharmacological properties including anti-cancer 
activity. However, its clinical application has been limited because of its low 
solubility, stability, and bioavailability. To overcome the limitation of 
curcumin, several modified curcumin conjugates and curcumin mimics were 
developed and studied for their anti-cancer properties. In this review, we have 
focused on the application of curcumin mimics and their conjugates for breast 
cancer."
1458,"BACKGROUND: Anlotinib is a highly potent multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor. 
Accumulating evidence suggests that anlotinib exhibits effective anti-tumor 
activity against various cancer subtypes. However, the effects of anlotinib 
against cisplatin-resistant (CIS) ovarian cancer (OC) are yet to be elucidated. 
The objective of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of 
anlotinib on the pathogenesis of cisplatin-resistant OC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human OC cell lines (A2780 and A2780 CIS) were cultured 
and treated with or without anlotinib. The effects of anlotinib on cell 
proliferation were determined using cell-counting kit-8 and colony-formation 
assays. To evaluate the invasion and metastasis of OC cells, we performed 
wound-healing and transwell assays. The cell cycle was analyzed via flow 
cytometry. A xenograft mouse model was used to conduct in vivo studies to verify 
the effects of anlotinib. The expression of Ki-67 in the tumor tissue was 
detected via immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction and Western blotting were used to measure the mRNA and protein levels.
RESULTS: Our study revealed that anlotinib significantly inhibited the 
proliferation, migration, and invasion of A2780 and A2780 CIS in a 
dose-dependent way in vitro (p &lt; 0.05). Through R software 'limma' package 
analysis of GSE15372, it was found that, in comparison with A2780, PLK2 was 
expressed in significantly low levels in the corresponding cisplatin-resistant 
strains. The ERK1/2/Plk2 signaling axis mediates the inhibitory effect of 
anlotinib on the proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cell lines. 
Moreover, our research found that anlotinib effectively inhibited the growth of 
tumor cells in an OC xenograft mouse model.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, anlotinib showed excellent inhibitory effects 
against cisplatin-resistant OC both in vitro and in vivo. These results add to 
the growing body of evidence supporting anlotinib as a potential anticancer 
agent against OC."
1459,"Plant-derived flavonoids are considered natural nontoxic chemo-preventers and 
have been widely studied for cancer treatment in recent decades. Mostly all 
flavonoid compounds show significant anti-inflammatory, anticancer and 
antioxidant properties. Kaempferol (Kmp) is a well-studied compound and exhibits 
remarkable anticancer and antioxidant potential. Kmp can regulate various 
cancer-related processes and activities such as cell cycle, oxidative stress, 
apoptosis, proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. The anti-cancer 
properties of Kmp primarily occur via modulation of apoptosis, MAPK/ERK1/2, 
P13K/Akt/mTOR, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathways. 
The anti-cancer property of Kmp has been recognized in several in-vivo and 
in-vitro studies which also includes numerous cell lines and animal models. This 
flavonoid possesses toxic activities against only cancer cells and have 
restricted toxicity on healthy cells. In this review, we present extensive 
research investigations about the therapeutic potential of Kmp in the management 
of different types of cancers. The anti-cancer properties of Kmp are discussed 
by concentration on its capability to target molecular-signalling pathway such 
as VEGF, STAT, p53, NF-κB and PI3K-AKT signalling pathways. The anti-cancer 
property of Kmf has gained a lot of attention, but the accurate action mechanism 
remains unclear. However, this natural compound has a great pharmacological 
capability and is now considered to be an alternative cancer treatment."
1460,"Curcumin is one of the most studied chemo-preventive agents, which may cause 
suppression, retardation, or inversion of carcinogenesis. But its application is 
currently limited because of its poor water-solubility and bioaccessibility. A 
curcumin O/W emulsion was prepared by high-pressure homogenization, using 
triglyceride monolaurate as an emulsifier and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) 
as the oil phase. The effects of emulsifiers, emulsifier concentration, oil 
type, oil-to-water ratio, and homogenization pressure and processing cycles on 
the physical stability and droplet size distribution of curcumin-encapsulated 
O/W emulsions were evaluated in this study. The results showed that the mean 
droplet size of the O/W emulsions remained remarkably stable during 60 days of 
storage under both light and dark conditions. Curcumin retentions in O/W 
emulsions after 60 days of storage under light and dark conditions were 97.9% 
and 81.6%, respectively. In addition, during the simulated gastrointestinal 
digestion process, the mean droplet size of the O/W emulsions increased from 260 
nm to 2743 nm after incubation with simulated gastric fluid (SGF) for 24 h, 
while the mean droplet size remained unchanged after incubation with simulated 
intestinal fluid (SIF). The results displayed negligible changes in curcumin 
content during incubation with simulated gastrointestinal fluids, indicating 
that effective protection of curcumin was achieved by encapsulation in the O/W 
emulsion. It is expected that curcumin will acquire high bioaccessibility and 
bioavailability when the O/W emulsion is to be used in clinical applications."
1461,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fast-growing and aggressive type of brain 
cancer. Unlike normal brain cells, GBM cells exhibit epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT), which is a crucial biological process in embryonic development 
and cell metastasis, and are highly invasive. Copper reportedly plays a critical 
role in the progression of a variety of cancers, including brain, breast, and 
lung cancers. However, excessive copper is toxic to cells. D-penicillamine (DPA) 
and triethylenetetramine (TETA) are well-known copper chelators and are the 
mainstay of treatment for copper-associated diseases. Following treatment with 
copper sulfate and DPA, GBM cells showed inhibition of proliferation and 
suppression of EMT properties, including reduced expression levels of 
N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and Zeb, which are cell markers associated with EMT. In 
contrast, treatment with copper sulfate and TETA yielded the opposite effects in 
GBM. Genes, including TGF-β, are associated with an increase in copper levels, 
implying their role in EMT. To analyze the invasion and spread of GBM, we used 
zebrafish embryos xenografted with the GBM cell line U87. The invasion of GBM 
cells into zebrafish embryos was markedly inhibited by copper treatment with 
DPA. Our findings suggest that treatment with copper and DPA inhibits 
proliferation and EMT through a mechanism involving TGF-β/Smad signaling in GBM. 
Therefore, DPA, but not TETA, could be used as adjuvant therapy for GBM with 
high copper concentrations."
1462,"Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors in adults, and have a 
poor prognosis, despite the different types of treatment available. There is 
growing demand for new therapies to treat this life-threatening tumor. Quinone 
derivatives from plants have received increased interest as potential 
anti-glioma drugs, due to their diverse pharmacologic activities, such as 
inhibiting cell growth, inflammation, tumor invasion, and promoting tumor 
regression. Previous studies have demonstrated the anti-glioma activity of 
Eleutherine plicata, which is related to three main naphthoquinone 
compounds-eleutherine, isoeleutherine, and eleutherol-but their mechanism of 
action remains elusive. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the 
mechanism of action of eleutherine on rat C6 glioma. In vitro cytotoxicity was 
evaluated by MTT assay; morphological changes were evaluated by phase-contrast 
microscopy. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V-FITC-propidium iodide 
staining, and antiproliferative effects were assessed by wound migration and 
colony formation assays. Protein kinase B (AKT/pAKT) expression was measured by 
western blot, and telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA was measured by 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Eleutherine reduced 
C6 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, suppressed migration and 
invasion, induced apoptosis, and reduced AKT phosphorylation and telomerase 
expression. In summary, our results suggest that eleutherine has potential 
clinical use in treating glioma."
1463,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death 
worldwide, and more therapies are needed to treat CRC. To discover novel CRC 
chemotherapeutic molecules, we used a series of previously synthesized novel 
imidazolidin-4-one derivatives to study their anticancer role in several cancer 
cell lines. Among these compounds, compound 9r exhibited the best anticancer 
activity in CRC cell lines HCT116 and SW620. We further investigated the 
anticancer molecular mechanism of compound 9r. We found that compound 9r induced 
mitochondrial pathway apoptosis in HCT116 and SW620 cells by inducing reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, the elevated ROS generation activated 
the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, which further accelerated apoptosis. 
N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant reagent, suppressed compound 9r-induced 
ROS production, JNK pathway activation, and apoptosis. Collectively, this 
research synthesized a series of imidazolidin-4-one derivatives, evaluated their 
anticancer activity, and explored the molecular mechanism of compound 9r-induced 
apoptosis in CRC cells. The present results suggest that compound 9r has a 
potential therapeutic role in CRC. Hence, it deserves further exploration as a 
lead compound for CRC treatment."
1464,"The well-known proto-oncogene rearrangement during transfection (RET), also 
known as ret proto-oncogene Homo sapiens (human), is a rare gene that is 
involved in the physiological development of some organ systems and can activate 
various cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and 
papillary thyroid cancer. In the past few years, cancers with RET alterations 
have been treated with multikinase inhibitors (MKIs). However, because of 
off-target effects, these MKIs have developed drug resistance and some 
unacceptable adverse effects. Therefore, these MKIs are limited in their 
clinical application. Thus, the novel highly potent and RET-specific inhibitors 
selpercatinib and pralsetinib have been accelerated for approval by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), and clinical trials of TPX-0046 and zetletinib are 
underway. It is well tolerated and a potential therapeutic for RET-altered 
cancers. Thus, we will focus on current state-of-the-art therapeutics with these 
novel RET inhibitors and show their efficacy and safety in therapy."
1465,"Breast cancer is the neoplasia of highest incidence in women worldwide. 
Docetaxel (DTX), a taxoid used to treat breast cancer, is a BCS-class-IV 
compound (low oral bioavailability, solubility and intestinal permeability). 
Nanotechnological strategies can improve chemotherapy effectiveness by promoting 
sustained release and reducing systemic toxicity. Nanostructured lipid carriers 
(NLC) encapsulate hydrophobic drugs in their blend-of-lipids matrix, and 
imperfections prevent drug expulsion during storage. This work describes the 
preparation, by design of experiments (23 factorial design) of a novel NLC 
formulation containing copaiba oil (CO) as a functional excipient. The optimized 
formulation (NLCDTX) showed approximately 100% DTX encapsulation efficiency and 
was characterized by different techniques (DLS, NTA, TEM/FE-SEM, DSC and XRD) 
and was stable for 12 months of storage, at 25 °C. Incorporation into the NLC 
prolonged drug release for 54 h, compared to commercial DTX (10 h). In vitro 
cytotoxicity tests revealed the antiproliferative effect of CO and NLCDTX, by 
reducing the cell viability of breast cancer (4T1/MCF-7) and healthy (NIH-3T3) 
cells more than commercial DTX. NLCDTX thus emerges as a promising drug delivery 
system of remarkable anticancer effect, (strengthened by CO) and sustained 
release that, in clinics, may decrease systemic toxicity at lower DTX doses."
1466,"Current therapy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) are based on the use of Remdesivir 1, Molnupiravir 2, and the 
recently identified Nirmatrelvir 3. Unfortunately, these three drugs showed some 
limitations regarding potency and possible drug-drug interactions. A series of 
derivatives coming from a decoration approach of the privileged scaffold 
s-triazines were synthesized and evaluated against SAR-CoV-2. One derivative 
emerged as the hit of the series for its micromolar antiviral activity and low 
cytotoxicity. Mode of action and pharmacokinetic in vitro preliminary studies 
further confirm the role as candidates for a future optimization campaign of the 
most active derivative identified with this work."
1467,"The PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) is an innovative technique for the 
selective degradation of target proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. 
Compared with traditional protein inhibitor drugs, PROTACs exhibit advantages in 
the efficacy and selectivity of and in overcoming drug resistance in cancer 
therapy, providing new insights into the discovery of anti-cancer drugs. In the 
last two decades, many PROTAC molecules have been developed to induce the 
degradation of cancer-related targets, and they have been subjected to clinical 
trials. Here, we comprehensively review the historical milestones and latest 
updates in PROTAC technology. We focus on the structures and mechanisms of 
PROTACs and their application in targeting tumor-related targets. We have listed 
several representative PROTACs based on CRBN, VHL, MDM2, or cIAP1 E3 ligases, 
and PROTACs that are undergoing anti-cancer clinical trials. In addition, the 
limitations of the current research, as well as the future research directions 
are described to improve the PROTAC design and development for cancer therapy."
1468,"Phloretin is a natural dihydrochalcone found in many fruits and vegetables, 
especially in apple tree leaves and the Manchurian apricots, exhibiting several 
therapeutic properties, such as antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, 
and antitumor activities. In this review article, the diverse aspects of the 
anticancer potential of phloretin are addressed, presenting its 
antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antimetastatic, and antiangiogenic activities 
in many different preclinical cancer models. The fact that phloretin is a planar 
lipophilic polyphenol and, thus, a membrane-disrupting Pan-Assay Interference 
compound (PAIN) compromises the validity of the cell-based anticancer 
activities. Phloretin significantly reduces membrane dipole potential and, 
therefore, is expected to be able to activate a number of cellular signaling 
pathways in a non-specific way. In this way, the effects of this minor flavonoid 
on Bax and Bcl-2 proteins, caspases and MMPs, cytokines, and inflammatory 
enzymes are all analyzed in the current review. Moreover, besides the anticancer 
activities exerted by phloretin alone, its co-effects with conventional 
anticancer drugs are also under discussion. Therefore, this review presents a 
thorough overview of the preclinical anticancer potential of phloretin, allowing 
one to take the next steps in the development of novel drug candidates and move 
on to clinical trials."
1469,"In our continuous study for some African plants as a source for 
antitrypanosomally and cytotoxic active drugs, nine different plants belonging 
to the Crassulaceae family have been selected for the present study. Sedum 
sieboldii leaves extract showed an antitrypanosomal activity against Trypanosoma 
brucei with an IC50 value of 8.5 µg/mL. In addition, they have cytotoxic 
activities against (HCT-116), (HEPG-2) and (MCF-7), with IC50 values of 28.18 ± 
0.24, 22.05 ± 0.66, and 26.47 ± 0.85 µg/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the 
extract displayed inhibition against Topoisomerase-1 with an IC50 value of 1.31 
µg/mL. It showed the highest phenolics and flavonoids content among the other 
plants' extracts. In order to identify the secondary metabolites which may be 
responsible for such activities, profiling of the polar secondary metabolites of 
S. sieboldii extract via Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to 
High-Resolution QTOF-MS operated in negative and positive ionization modes, 
which revealed the presence of 46 metabolites, including flavonoids, phenolic 
acids, anthocyanidins, coumarin, and other metabolites."
1470,"Endophytic fungi are a diverse group of microorganisms that colonize the inter- 
or intracellular spaces of plants and exhibit mutual benefits. Their 
interactions with the host plant and other microbiomes are multidimensional and 
play a crucial role in the production of secondary metabolites. We screened 
bioactive compounds present in the extracts of Aspergillus flavus, an endophytic 
fungus isolated from the roots of the medicinal grass Cynodon dactylon, for its 
anticancer potential. An in vitro analysis of the Ethyl acetate extract from A. 
flavus showed significant cytostatic effects (IC50: 16.25 μg/mL) against breast 
cancer cells (MCF-7). A morphological analysis of the cells and a flow cytometry 
of the cells with annexin V/Propidium Iodide suggested that the extract induced 
apoptosis in the MCF-7 cells. The extract of A. flavus increased reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) generation and caused a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential 
in MCF-7 cells. To identify the metabolites that might be responsible for the 
anticancer effect, the extract was subjected to a gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Interestingly, nine phytochemicals that induced 
cytotoxicity in the breast cancer cell line were found in the extract. The in 
silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed that 
two compounds, 2,4,7-trinitrofluorenone and 3α, 5 α-cyclo-ergosta-7,9(11), 
22t-triene-6beta-ol exhibited significant binding affinities (-9.20, and -9.50 
Kcal/mol, respectively) against Bcl-2, along with binding stability and 
intermolecular interactions of its ligand-Bcl-2 complexes. Overall, the study 
found that the endophytic A. flavus from C. dactylon contains plant-like 
bioactive compounds that have a promising effect in breast cancer."
1471,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent and serious gastrointestinal malignancy 
with high mortality and morbidity. Chemoprevention refers to a newly emerged 
strategy that uses drugs with chemopreventive properties to promote 
antioxidation, regulate cancer cell cycle, suppress proliferation, and induce 
cellular apoptosis, so as to improve cancer treatment outcomes. Natural 
polyphenols are currently recognized as a class of chemopreventive agents that 
have shown remarkable anticarcinogenic properties. Numerous in vitro and in vivo 
studies have elucidated the anti-CRC mechanisms of natural polyphenols, such as 
regulation of various molecular and signaling pathways. Natural polyphenols are 
also reportedly capable of modulating the gut microbiota and cancer stem cells 
(CSCs) to suppress tumor formation and progression. Combined use of different 
natural polyphenols is recommended due to their low bioavailability and 
instability, and combination treatment can exert synergistical effects, reduce 
side effects, and avoid drug resistance in CRC treatment. In summary, the 
application of polyphenols in the chemoprevention and treatment of CRC is 
promising. Further clinical evaluation of their effectiveness is warranted and 
anticipated."
1472,"Prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer among men. The main 
method of its treatment is androgen deprivation therapy, which has a wide range 
of side effects. One of the solutions to this challenge is the targeted delivery 
of drugs to prostate cancer cells. In this study, we performed the synthesis of 
a novel small-molecule PSMA-targeted conjugate based on abiraterone. 
Cytotoxicity, the induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and 
P450-cytochrome species inhibition were investigated for this conjugate 
PSMA-abiraterone. The conjugate demonstrated a preferential effect on prostate 
tumor cells, remaining inactive at up to 100 µM in human fibroblast cells. In 
addition, it revealed preferential efficacy, specifically on PSMA-expressing 
lines with a 65% tumor growth inhibition level on 22Rv1 (PSMA+) xenografts after 
14-fold oral administration of PSMA-Abi at a single dose of 500 mg/kg (7.0 g/kg 
total dose) was observed. This compound showed significantly reduced acute 
toxicity with comparable efficacy compared to AbiAc."
1473,"Cardiac fibrosis is a common pathophysiologic process in nearly all forms of 
heart disease which refers to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix 
proteins by cardiac fibroblasts. Activated fibroblasts are the central cellular 
effectors in cardiac fibrosis, and fibrotic remodelling can cause several 
cardiac dysfunctions either by reducing the ejection fraction due to a stiffened 
myocardial matrix, or by impairing electric conductance. Recently, there is a 
rising focus on the proteomic studies of cardiac fibrosis for pathogenesis 
elucidation and potential biomarker mining. This paper summarizes the current 
knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac fibrosis, discusses the 
potential of imaging and circulating biomarkers available to recognize different 
phenotypes of this lesion, reviews the currently available and potential future 
therapies that allow individualized management in reversing progressive 
fibrosis, as well as the recent progress on proteomic studies of cardiac 
fibrosis. Proteomic approaches using clinical specimens and animal models can 
provide the ability to track pathological changes and new insights into the 
mechanisms underlining cardiac fibrosis. Furthermore, spatial and cell-type 
resolved quantitative proteomic analysis may also serve as a minimally invasive 
method for diagnosing cardiac fibrosis and allowing for the initiation of 
prophylactic treatment."
1474,"Arbutin, a hydroquinone glucoside, has been detected in ca. 50 plant families, 
especially in the plants of the Asteraceae, Ericaceae, Proteaceae and Rosaceae 
families. It is one of the most widely used natural skin-whitening agents. In 
addition to its skin whitening property, arbutin possesses other therapeutically 
relevant biological properties, e.g., antioxidant, antimicrobial and 
anti-inflammatory, as well as anticancer potential. This review presents, for 
the first time, a comprehensive overview of the distribution of arbutin in the 
plant kingdom and critically appraises its therapeutic potential as an 
anticancer agent based on the literature published until the end of August 2022, 
accessed via several databases, e.g., Web of Science, Science Direct, Dictionary 
of Natural Products, PubMed and Google Scholar. The keywords used in the search 
were arbutin, cancer, anticancer, distribution and hydroquinone. Published 
outputs suggest that arbutin has potential anticancer properties against 
bladder, bone, brain, breast, cervix, colon, liver, prostate and skin cancers 
and a low level of acute or chronic toxicity."
1475,"Polyphenols are secondary metabolites produced by plants, which contribute to 
the plant's defense against abiotic stress conditions (e.g., UV radiation and 
precipitation), the aggression of herbivores, and plant pathogens. 
Epidemiological studies suggest that long-term consumption of plant polyphenols 
protects against cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, and 
neurodegenerative diseases. Their structural diversity has fascinated and 
confronted analytical chemists on how to carry out unambiguous identification, 
exhaustive recovery from plants and organic waste, and define their nutritional 
and biological potential. The food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries 
employ polyphenols from fruits and vegetables to produce additives, additional 
foods, and supplements. In some cases, nanocarriers have been used to protect 
polyphenols during food processing, to solve the issues related to low water 
solubility, to transport them to the site of action, and improve their 
bioavailability. This review summarizes the structure-bioactivity relationships, 
processing parameters that impact polyphenol stability and bioavailability, the 
research progress in nanocarrier delivery, and the most innovative methodologies 
for the exhaustive recovery of polyphenols from plant and agri-waste materials."
1476,"Vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) is a rare malignancy with a relatively 
good prognosis. However, the prognosis remains poor for elderly patients and 
those with a significant depth of tumor invasion; thus, novel treatment 
modalities are needed. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of 
cannabidiol (CBD) and its combination with NSAIDs, diclofenac (DIC) and 
ibuprofen (IBU) on VSCC cells. In this regard, the MTT test was applied for 
cytotoxicity analysis. Moreover, the influence of CBD, DIC and IBU, as well as 
their combinations, on apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were analyzed by 
flow cytometry. The mechanisms of action of the analyzed compounds, including 
their impact on NF-κB signaling, p53 and COX-2 expression were evaluated using 
Western blot. This study shows that CBD and its combinations with NSAIDs are 
cytotoxic to A431 cells, but they also reduce, in a dose-dependent manner, the 
viability of immortalized keratinocyte HaCaT cells, and human umbilical vein 
cell line, EA.hy926. Moreover, the compounds and their combinations induced 
apoptosis, diminished the NF-κB signaling activation and reduced COX-2 
expression. We conclude that CBD and its combination with DIC or IBU are 
promising candidates for the adjuvant treatment of high-risk VSCC patients. 
However, their impact on non-cancerous cells requires careful evaluation."
1477,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor 
erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NRF2, also known as NFE2L2), are two of the most 
complicated transcription regulators, which participate in a variety of 
physiological processes. Numerous studies have shown that they are overactivated 
in multiple types of tumors. Interestingly, STAT3 and NRF2 can also interact 
with each other to regulate tumor progression. Hence, these two important 
transcription factors are considered key targets for developing a new class of 
antitumor drugs. This review summarizes the pivotal roles of the two 
transcription regulators and their interactions in the tumor microenvironment to 
identify potential antitumor drug targets and, ultimately, improve patients' 
health and survival."
1478,"Our investigation includes the synthesis of new 
naphthalene-bis-triazole-bis-quinolin-2(1H)-ones 4a-e and 7a-e&amp;nbsp;via 
Cu-catalyzed [3 + 2] cycloadditions of 4-azidoquinolin-2(1H)-ones 3a-e with 
1,5-/or 1,8-bis(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)naphthalene (2) or (6). All structures of the 
obtained products have been confirmed with different spectroscopic analyses. 
Additionally, a mild and versatile method based on copper-catalyzed [3 + 2] 
cycloaddition (Meldal-Sharpless reaction) was developed to tether quinolinones 
to O-atoms of 1,5- or 1,8-dinaphthols. The triazolo linkers could be considered 
as anti and syn products, which are interesting precursors for functionalized 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors with potential apoptotic 
antiproliferative action. The antiproliferative activities of the 4a-e and 7a-e 
were evaluated. Compounds 4a-e and 7a-e demonstrated strong antiproliferative 
activity against the four tested cancer cell lines, with mean GI50 ranging from 
34 nM to 134 nM compared to the reference erlotinib, which had a GI50 of 33 nM. 
The most potent derivatives as antiproliferative agents, compounds 4a, 4b, and 
7d, were investigated for their efficacy as EGFR inhibitors, with IC50 values 
ranging from 64 nM to 97 nM. Compounds 4a, 4b, and 7d demonstrated potent 
apoptotic effects via their effects on caspases 3, 8, 9, Cytochrome C, Bax, and 
Bcl2. Finally, docking studies show the relevance of the free amino group of the 
quinoline moiety for antiproliferative action via hydrogen bond formation with 
essential amino acids."
1479,"NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S8 (NDUFS8) is an essential core 
subunit and component of the iron-sulfur (FeS) fragment of mitochondrial complex 
I directly involved in the electron transfer process and energy metabolism. 
Pathogenic variants of the NDUFS8 are relevant to infantile-onset and severe 
diseases, including Leigh syndrome, cancer, and diabetes mellitus. With over 
1000 nuclear genes potentially causing a mitochondrial disorder, the current 
diagnostic approach requires targeted molecular analysis, guided by a 
combination of clinical and biochemical features. Currently, there are only 
several studies on pathogenic variants of the NDUFS8 in Leigh syndrome, and a 
lack of literature on its precise mechanism in cancer and diabetes mellitus 
exists. Therefore, NDUFS8-related diseases should be extensively explored and 
precisely diagnosed at the molecular level with the application of 
next-generation sequencing technologies. A more distinct comprehension will be 
needed to shed light on NDUFS8 and its related diseases for further research. In 
this review, a comprehensive summary of the current knowledge about NDUFS8 
structural function, its pathogenic mutations in Leigh syndrome, as well as its 
underlying roles in cancer and diabetes mellitus is provided, offering potential 
pathogenesis, progress, and therapeutic target of different diseases. We also 
put forward some problems and solutions for the following investigations."
1480,"This study concerns the role of activated carbon (AC) from palm raceme as a 
support material for the enhancement of lipase-catalyzed reactions in an aqueous 
solution, with deep eutectic solvent (DES) as a co-solvent. The effects of 
carbonization temperature, impregnation ratio, and carbonization time on lipase 
activity were studied. The activities of Amano lipase from Burkholderia cepacia 
(AML) and lipase from the porcine pancreas (PPL) were used to investigate the 
optimum conditions for AC preparation. The results showed that AC has more 
interaction with PPL and effectively provides greater enzymatic activity 
compared with AML. The optimum treatment conditions of AC samples that yield the 
highest enzymatic activity were 0.5 (NaOH (g)/palm raceme (g)), 150 min, and a 
carbonization temperature of 400 °C. DES was prepared from alanine/sodium 
hydroxide and used with AC for the further enhancement of enzymatic activity. 
Kinetic studies demonstrated that the activity of PPL was enhanced with the 
immobilization of AC in a DES medium."
1481,"Leuprolide is a synthetic nonapeptide drug 
(pyroGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-d-Leu-Leu-Arg-Pro-NHEt) that acts as a 
gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. The continuous administration of 
therapeutic doses of leuprolide inhibits gonadotropin secretion, which is used 
in androgen-deprivation therapy for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer, 
central precocious puberty, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and other 
sex-hormone-related conditions. To improve the pharmacokinetic properties of 
peptide drugs, a fatty acid was conjugated with leuprolide for long-term action. 
In this study, we developed a simple ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous 
determination of leuprolide and leuprolide-oleic acid conjugate (LOC) levels. 
The developed method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, 
recovery, matrix effect, and stability according to the US Food and Drug 
Administration guidelines, and the parameters were within acceptable limits. 
Subsequently, the pharmacokinetics of leuprolide and LOCs were evaluated. In 
vivo rat subcutaneous studies revealed that conjugation with fatty acids 
significantly altered the pharmacokinetics of leuprolide. After the subcutaneous 
administration of fatty-acid-conjugated leuprolide, the mean absorption time and 
half-life were prolonged. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study 
showing the effects of fatty acid conjugates on the pharmacokinetics of 
leuprolide using a newly developed UPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous 
quantification of leuprolide and LOCs."
1482,"Bimetallic nanomaterials (BMNs) composed of two different metal elements have 
certain mixing patterns and geometric structures, and they often have superior 
properties than monometallic nanomaterials. Bimetallic-based nanomaterials have 
been widely investigated and extensively used in many biomedical fields 
especially cancer therapy because of their unique morphology and structure, 
special physicochemical properties, excellent biocompatibility, and synergistic 
effect. However, most reviews focused on the application of BMNs in cancer 
diagnoses (sensing, and imaging) and rarely mentioned the application of the 
treatment of cancer. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive 
perspective on the recent progress of BNMs as therapeutic agents. We first 
introduce and discuss the synthesis methods, intrinsic properties (size, 
morphology, and structure), and optical and catalytic properties relevant to 
cancer therapy. Then, we highlight the application of BMNs in cancer therapy 
(e.g., drug/gene delivery, radiotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic 
therapy, enzyme-mediated tumor therapy, and multifunctional synergistic 
therapy). Finally, we put forward insights for the forthcoming in order to make 
more comprehensive use of BMNs and improve the medical system of cancer 
treatment."
1483,"Pyrazole, an important pharmacophore and a privileged scaffold of immense 
significance, is a five-membered heterocyclic moiety with an extensive 
therapeutic profile, viz., anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-anxiety, 
anticancer, analgesic, antipyretic, etc. Due to the expansion of pyrazolecent 
red pharmacological molecules at a quicker pace, there is an urgent need to put 
emphasis on recent literature with hitherto available information to recognize 
the status of this scaffold for pharmaceutical research. The reported potential 
pyrazole-containing compounds are highlighted in the manuscript for the 
treatment of cancer and inflammation, and the results are mentioned in % 
inhibition of inflammation, % growth inhibition, IC50, etc. Pyrazole is an 
important heterocyclic moiety with a strong pharmacological profile, which may 
act as an important pharmacophore for the drug discovery process. In the 
struggle to cultivate suitable anti-inflammatory and anticancer agents, chemists 
have now focused on pyrazole biomolecules. This review conceals the recent 
expansion of pyrazole biomolecules as anti-inflammatory and anticancer agents 
with an aim to provide better correlation among different research going around 
the world."
1484,"The complications of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) seriously endanger 
people's health, such as bleeding, polyp hyperplasia, and even cancer. Although 
the precise pathophysiology of IBD is unknown, alterations in the intestinal 
lymphatic network, such as lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic vessel dysfunction, 
are well-established features. Therefore, the development of a reliable 
technology is urgently required, with a stereoscopic, deep, and high-resolution 
technology for IBD lymphatic targeting imaging in clinical practice. However, 
indocyanine green, the only clinically approved imaging agent by the Food and 
Drug Administration, can easily cause self-aggregation or be interfered with by 
microenvironments, causing fluorescence quenching, which seriously affects the 
imaging and detective capabilities. Herein, indocyanine green molecules are 
arranged in a 1.5-nanometer one-dimensional channel (TpPa-1@ICG). Based on this 
specified structure, the fluorescence enhancement effect is observed in the 
TpPa-1@ICG resultant, and the fluorescence intensity is enhanced by 27%. In 
addition, the ICG-incorporated porous solid reveals outstanding solvent 
(dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, etc.) and thermal (&gt;300 °C) stability. 
After modifying the target molecules, TpPa-1@ICG showed excellent imaging 
ability for intestinal lymphatic vessels, providing a new imaging tool for IBDs 
research."
1485,"In the present work, the facile eco-friendly synthesis and evaluation of the 
anti-tumor activity of Ni(OH)2@Mn3O4 nanocomposite were carried out. The 
synthesis of Ni(OH)2@Mn3O4 nanocomposite from chia-seed extract was mediated by 
sonication. The obtained materials were characterized by different spectroscopic 
techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron 
microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction 
(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), and 
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies. The results of XRD, SEM, EDS, 
TEM, FT-IR, and UV-Vis analysis indicate the successful manufacturing of a 
crystalline, cactus-type Ni(OH)2@Mn3O4 nanocomposite of 10.10 nm average 
particle size. XPS analysis confirms that the synthesized materials consist 
mainly of Ni2+, Mn2+, and Mn3+. The antitumor activity of the nanocomposite was 
tested against a breast cancer (MCF-7) cell line. The results showed 
Ni(OH)2@Mn3O4 nanocomposite possesses insignificant cytotoxicity. The cell-death 
percentage was 34% at a 100 ppm concentration of Ni(OH)2@Mn3O4 nanocomposite. 
The obtained results imply that the synthesized nanocomposite could be suitable 
and safe for drug delivery and water treatment."
1486,"In the present work, a series of new 
1-{5-[2,5-bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phenyl]-1,3,4-oxadiazol-3-acetyl-2-aryl-2H/methyl 
derivatives were synthesized through a multistep reaction sequence. The 
compounds were synthesized by the condensation of various aldehydes and 
acetophenones with the laboratory-synthesized acid hydrazide, which afforded the 
Schiff's bases. Cyclization of the Schiff bases yielded 1,3,4-oxadiazole 
derivatives. By spectral analysis, the structures of the newly synthesized 
compounds were elucidated, and further, their anti-cancer and anti-diabetic 
properties were investigated. To examine the dynamic behavior of the candidates 
at the binding site of the protein, molecular docking experiments on the 
synthesized compounds were performed, followed by a molecular dynamic 
simulation. ADMET (chemical absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and 
toxicity) prediction revealed that most of the synthesized compounds follow 
Lipinski's rule of 5. The results were further correlated with biological 
studies. Using a cytotoxic assay, the newly synthesized 1,3,4-Oxadiazoles were 
screened for their in vitro cytotoxic efficacy against the LN229 Glioblastoma 
cell line. From the cytotoxic assay, the compounds 5b, 5d, and 5m were taken for 
colony formation assay and tunnel assay have shown significant cell apoptosis by 
damaging the DNA of cancer cells. The in vivo studies using a genetically 
modified diabetic model, Drosophila melanogaster, indicated that compounds 5d 
and 5f have better anti-diabetic activity among the different synthesized 
compounds. These compounds lowered the glucose levels significantly in the 
tested model."
1487,"Isoprenoids are the output of the polymerization of five-carbon, branched 
isoprenic chains derived from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer, 
dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). Isoprene units are consecutively condensed 
to form longer structures such as farnesyl and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (FPP 
and GGPP, respectively), necessary for the biosynthesis of several metabolites. 
Polyprenyl transferases and synthases use polyprenyl pyrophosphates as their 
natural substrates; however, it is known that free polyprenols, such as farnesol 
(FOH), and geranylgeraniol (GGOH) can be incorporated into prenylated proteins, 
ubiquinone, cholesterol, and dolichols. Furthermore, FOH and GGOH have been 
shown to block the effects of isoprenoid biosynthesis inhibitors such as 
fosmidomycin, bisphosphonates, or statins in several organisms. This phenomenon 
is the consequence of a short pathway, which was observed for the first time 
more than 25 years ago: the polyprenol salvage pathway, which works via the 
phosphorylation of FOH and GGOH. Biochemical studies in bacteria, animals, and 
plants suggest that this pathway can be carried out by two enzymes: a polyprenol 
kinase and a polyprenyl-phosphate kinase. However, to date, only a few genes 
have been unequivocally identified to encode these enzymes in photosynthetic 
organisms. Nevertheless, pieces of evidence for the importance of this pathway 
abound in studies related to infectious diseases, cancer, dyslipidemias, and 
nutrition, and to the mitigation of the secondary effects of several drugs. 
Furthermore, nowadays it is known that both FOH and GGOH can be incorporated via 
dietary sources that produce various biological effects. This review presents, 
in a simplified but comprehensive manner, the most important data on the FOH and 
GGOH salvage pathway, stressing its biomedical importance The main objective of 
this review is to bring to light the need to discover and characterize the 
kinases associated with the isoprenoid salvage pathway in animals and pathogens."
1488,"A targeted strategy for treating cancer is antibody-directed enzyme prodrug 
therapy, where the enzyme attached to the antibody causes conversion of an 
inactive small-molecule prodrug into an active drug. A limitation may be the 
diffusion of the active drug away from the antibody target site. A related 
strategy with radiotherapeutics entails enzymatically promoted conversion of a 
soluble to insoluble radiotherapeutic agent, thereby immobilizing the latter at 
the target site. Such a molecular brachytherapy has been scarcely investigated. 
In distinct research, the advent of molecular designs for aggregation-induced 
emission (AIE) suggests translational use in molecular brachytherapy. Here, 
several 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole substrates that readily aggregate in 
aqueous solution (and afford AIE) were elaborated in this regard. In particular, 
(1) the 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl) unit was derivatized to bear a pegylated 
phosphodiester that imparts water solubility yet undergoes enzymatic cleavage, 
and (2) a p-phenol unit was attached to the benzo moiety to provide a reactive 
site for final-step iodination (here examined with natural abundance iodide). 
The pegylated phosphodiester-iodinated benzothiazole undergoes conversion from 
aqueous-soluble to aqueous-insoluble upon treatment with a phosphatase or 
phosphodiesterase. The aggregation is essential to molecular brachytherapy, 
whereas the induced emission of AIE is not essential but provides a convenient 
basis for research development. Altogether, 21 compounds were synthesized (18 
new, 3 known via new routes). Taken together, blending biomedical strategies of 
enzyme prodrug therapy with materials chemistry concerning substances that 
undergo AIE may comprise a step forward on the long road toward molecular 
brachytherapy."
1489,"Neuroblast differentiation-associated protein AHNAK, a large structural scaffold 
protein, remains mysterious in biological processes. AHNAK plays a suppressive 
or progressive role in different types of cancers. To investigate the role of 
the AHNAK in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cell viability assays were 
performed to determine the cell proliferation of the stable AHNAK-knockdown 
HepG2 cell line; co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and liquid chromatography 
coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were performed on HCC and 
matched paracancerous (MPC) tissues. The Metascape platform was used for 
enrichment analyses; the ""ComplexHeatmap"" package was applied for cluster 
analyses and visualization. Co-IP, Western botting and immunofluorescence double 
staining were performed to assess the interactions between AHNAK and 
insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). AHNAK silencing reduced the 
viability of HepG2 cells; the interactome in HCC and MPC tissues enriched 204 
pathways and processes, which partially reflected the signature of HCC field 
cancerization. AHNAK could co-localize and interact with IGF-1R. These results 
suggested that the AHNAK complex contributes to HCC growth, potentially by 
interacting with IGF-1R."
1490,"Conventional anticancer treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, have 
significantly improved cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the existing traditional 
anticancer treatments have been reported to cause serious side effects and 
resistance to cancer and even to severely affect the quality of life of cancer 
survivors, which indicates the utmost urgency to develop effective and safe 
anticancer treatments. As the primary focus of cancer nanotheranostics, 
nanomaterials with unique surface chemistry and shape have been investigated for 
integrating cancer diagnostics with treatment techniques, including guiding a 
prompt diagnosis, precise imaging, treatment with an effective dose, and 
real-time supervision of therapeutic efficacy. Several theranostic nanosystems 
have been explored for cancer diagnosis and treatment in the past decade. 
However, metal-based nanotheranostics continue to be the most common types of 
nonentities. Consequently, the present review covers the physical 
characteristics of effective metallic, functionalized, and hybrid 
nanotheranostic systems. The scope of coverage also includes the clinical 
advantages and limitations of cancer nanotheranostics. In light of these 
viewpoints, future research directions exploring the robustness and clinical 
viability of cancer nanotheranostics through various strategies to enhance the 
biocompatibility of theranostic nanoparticles are summarised."
1491,"The Mediterranean diet is recognized as a sustainable dietary approach with 
beneficial health effects. This is highly relevant, although the production of 
typical Mediterranean food, i.e., olive oil or wine, processed tomatoes and 
pomegranate products, generates significant amounts of waste. Ideally, this 
waste should be disposed in an appropriate, eco-friendly way. A number of 
scientific papers were published recently showing that these by-products can be 
exploited as a valuable source of biologically active components with health 
benefits, including anticancer effects. In this review, accordingly, we 
elaborate on such phytochemicals recovered from the food waste generated during 
the processing of vegetables and fruits, typical of the Mediterranean diet, with 
a focus on substances with anticancer activity. The molecular mechanisms of 
these phytochemicals, which might be included in supporting treatment and 
prevention of various types of cancer, are presented. The use of bioactive 
components from food waste may improve the economic feasibility and 
sustainability of the food processing industry in the Mediterranean region and 
can provide a new strategy to approach prevention of cancer."
1492,"Melatonin, a naturally biosynthesized molecule secreted by the pineal gland, 
exhibits antitumor activities against several different types of cancer. The 
mechanisms of action of melatonin against tumor progression involve cellular 
apoptosis, antimetastatic activity, antioxidant and mutagenic effects, 
antiangiogenic activity, and the restoration of cancer immune surveillance. 
Melatonin has anticancer activity when administered alone or in combination with 
standard chemotherapeutic agents, with measurable improvements seen in the 
clinical endpoints of tumor regression and patient survival. However, scant 
clinical evidence supports the use of melatonin in bladder cancer treatment. Our 
study has found that melatonin treatment suppresses the bladder cancer cell 
migratory ability by inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
process, which appears to be linked to melatonin-induced decreases in bladder 
cancer cell autophagy. Finally, an evaluation of in vivo melatonin-induced 
antitumor effects in an orthotopic animal model of bladder cancer indicated that 
melatonin treatment slightly prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Our 
study offers novel insights into the use of melatonin in bladder cancer 
treatment."
1493,"Worldwide, the incidence of cancer is on the rise. Current cancer treatments 
include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Chemotherapy and radiation 
treatment are typically associated with severe adverse effects and a decline in 
patients' quality of life. Anti-cancer substances derived from plants and 
animals need to be evaluated therapeutically as it is cost-effective, have fewer 
side effects, and can improve cancer patients' quality of life. Recently, bovine 
colostrum (BC) has attracted the interest of numerous researchers investigating 
its anti-cancer potential in humans. Dressings loaded with BC are beneficial in 
treating chronic wounds and diabetic foot ulcers. Lactoferrin, a glycoprotein 
with potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-microbial 
effects, is abundant in BC. The BC pills successfully promote the regression of 
low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia when administered intravaginally. 
The biological, genetic, and molecular mechanisms driving BC remain to be 
determined. Oral BC supplements are generally well-tolerated, but some 
flatulence and nausea may happen. To evaluate the therapeutic effects, long-term 
safety, and appropriate dosages of BC drugs, well-designed clinical trials are 
necessary. The purpose of this article is to emphasize the anti-cancer potential 
of BC and its constituents."
1494,"Helicobacter pylori infection is an important risk factor for developing gastric 
cancer. However, only a few H. pylori-infected people develop gastric cancer. 
Thus, other risk factors aside from H. pylori infection may be involved in 
gastric cancer development. This study aimed to investigate whether the 
nitrate-reducing bacteria isolated from patients with atrophic gastritis caused 
by H. pylori infection are risk factors for developing atrophic gastritis and 
gastric neoplasia. Nitrate-reducing bacteria were isolated from patients with 
atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori infection. Among the isolated bacteria, 
Actinomyces oris, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Rothia dentocariosa, and Rothia 
mucilaginosa were used in the subsequent experiments. Cytokine inducibility was 
evaluated in monocytic cells, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
activity and cell cycle were assessed in the gastric epithelial cells. The 
cytotoxicities and neutrophil-inducing abilities of the Actinomyces and Rothia 
species were enhanced when cocultured with H. pylori. Th1/Th2-related cytokines 
were also expressed, but their expression levels differed depending on the 
bacterial species. Moreover, H. pylori and Actinomyces activated MAPK (ERK and 
p38) and affected cell cycle progression. Some nitrate-reducing bacteria 
cocultured with H. pylori may promote inflammation and atrophy by inducing 
cytokine production. In addition, the MAPK activation and cell cycle progression 
caused by these bacteria can contribute to gastric cancer development."
1495,"Human Papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 is the main etiological agent of cervical 
cancer worldwide. Mutations within the virus genome may lead to an increased 
risk of cancer development and decreased vaccine response, but there is a lack 
of information about strains circulating in Sub-Saharan Africa. Endocervical 
cytology samples were collected from 480 women attending a voluntary cervical 
cancer screening program at Monkole Hospital and four outpatient centers in 
Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The prevalence of HPV 
infection was 18.8% and the most prevalent high-risk types were HPV16 (12.2%) 
followed by HPV52 (8.8%) and HPV33/HPV35 (7.8% each). HPV16 strains were 
characterized: 57.1% were classified as C lineage; two samples (28.6%) as A1 and 
one sample belonged to B1 lineage. HPV33, HPV35, HPV16, and HPV58 were the most 
frequent types associated with low-grade intraepithelial lesion while high-grade 
squamous intraepithelial lesions were predominantly associated with HPV16. 
Several L1 mutations (T266A, S282P, T353P, and N181T) were common in Kinshasa, 
and their potential effect on vaccine-induced neutralization, especially the 
presence of S282P, should be further investigated. Long control region (LCR) 
variability was high with frequent mutations like G7193T, G7521A, and G145T that 
could promote malignancy of these HPV16 strains. This study provides a helpful 
basis for understanding HPV16 variants circulating in Kinshasa and the potential 
association between mutations of LCR region and malignancy and of L1 and vaccine 
activity."
1496,"Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most common cause of genital tract infections 
as well as preventable blindness worldwide. Pattern recognition receptors such 
as toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent the initial step in recognizing 
pathogenic microorganisms and are crucial for the initiation of an appropriate 
immune response. However, our understanding of TLR-signaling in 
Chlamydia-infected immune cells is incomplete. For a better comprehension of 
pathological inflammatory responses, robust models for interrogating 
TLR-signaling upon chlamydial infections are needed. To analyze the TLR 
response, we developed and utilized a highly sensitive and selective fluorescent 
transcriptional cellular reporter system to measure the activity of the 
transcription factor NF-κB. Upon incubation of the reporter cells with different 
preparations of Ct, we were able to pinpoint which components of TLRs are 
involved in the recognition of Ct. We identified CD14 associated with unique 
characteristics of different serovars as the crucial factor of the TLR4/CD14/MD2 
complex for Ct-mediated activation of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, we found 
the TLR4/CD14/MD2 complex to be decisive for the uptake of Ct-derived 
lipopolysaccharides but not for infection and replication of Ct. Imaging flow 
cytometry provided information about inclusion formation in myeloid- as well as 
lymphocytic cells and was highest for Ct L2 with at least 25% of inclusion 
forming cells. Ct E inclusion formation was eminent in Jurkat cells without CD14 
expression (11.1%). Thus, our model enables to determine Ct uptake and signal 
induction by pinpointing individual components of the recognition and signaling 
pathways to better understand the immune response towards infectious pathogens."
1497,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent neoplasm and the second 
leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Microbiota and their products, such as 
bile acids (BAs), are important causal factors for the occurrence and 
development of CRC. Therefore, we performed 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) and 
liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to measure mucosal microbiota 
and BA composition in paired cancerous and noncancerous gut tissue samples from 
33 patients with CRC at a hospital in Beijing. In cancerous tissues, we detected 
altered mucosal microbiota with increased levels of the genera Bacteroides, 
Curtobacterium, and Campylobacter and an increase in deoxycholic acid (DCA), 
which was the only BA elevated in cancerous tissues. Ex vivo coculture showed 
that the mucosal microbiota in cancerous tissues indeed had a stronger DCA 
production ability, indicating that DCA-producing bacteria are enriched in 
tumors. Results from the CCK8 and Transwell assays indicated that DCA enhances 
the overgrowth, migration, and invasion of CRC cell lines, and, through qPCR and 
Western blot analyses, downregulation of FXR was observed in CRC cell lines 
after DCA culture. We then verified the downregulation of FXR expression in 
cancerous tissues using our data and the TCGA database, and we found that FXR 
downregulation plays an important role in the development of CRC. In conclusion, 
differing mucosal microbiota, increased amounts of mucosal DCA, and lower FXR 
expression were demonstrated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissue 
samples. The results of this study can be applied to the development of 
potential therapeutic targets for CRC prevention, such as altering mucosal 
microbiota, DCA, or FXR."
1498,"Weissella is a genus earlier considered a member of the family Leuconostocaceae, 
which was reclassified into the family Lactobacillaceae in 1993. Recently, there 
have been studies emphasizing the probiotic and anti-inflammatory potential of 
various species of Weissella, of which W. confusa and W. cibaria are the most 
representative. Other species within this genus include: W. 
paramesenteroides,&amp;nbsp;W. viridescens,&amp;nbsp;W. halotolerans, W. minor, 
W. kandleri,&amp;nbsp;W. soli,&amp;nbsp;W. ghanensis, W. hellenica,&amp;nbsp;W. 
thailandensis,&amp;nbsp;W. fabalis,&amp;nbsp;W. cryptocerci, W. koreensis, W. 
beninensis, W. fabaria, W. oryzae,&amp;nbsp;W. ceti, W. uvarum, W. bombi, W. 
sagaensis, W. kimchi,&amp;nbsp;W. muntiaci, W. jogaejeotgali, W. coleopterorum, 
W. hanii, W. salipiscis, and W. diestrammenae. Weissella confusa, W. 
paramesenteroides, W. koreensis, and W. cibaria are among the few species that 
have been isolated from human samples, although the identification of these and 
other species is possible using metagenomics, as we have shown for inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls. We were able to isolate Weissella in 
gut-associated bacteria (post 24 h food deprivation and laxatives). Other 
sources of isolation include fermented food, soil, and skin/gut/saliva of 
insects/animals. With the potential for hospital and industrial applications, 
there is a concern about possible infections. Herein, we present the current 
applications of Weissella on its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory mechanistic 
effects, the predisposing factors (e.g., vancomycin) for pathogenicity in 
humans, and the antimicrobials used in patients. To address the medical 
concerns, we examined 28 case reports focused on W. confusa and found that 78.5% 
of infections were bacteremia (of which 7 were fatal; 1 for lack of treatment), 
8 were associated with underlying malignancies, and 8 with gastrointestinal 
procedures/diseases of which 2 were Crohn's disease patients. In cases of a 
successful resolution, commonly administered antibiotics included: 
cephalosporin, ampicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and daptomycin. Despite 
reports of Weissella-related infections, the evolving mechanistic findings 
suggest that Weissella are clinically treatable bacteria with emerging 
antimicrobial and probiotic benefits ranging from oral health, skin care, 
obesity, and inflammatory diseases to cancer."
1499,"The oral cavity presents a highly diverse community of microorganisms due to the 
unique environmental conditions for microbial adhesion and growth [...]."
1500,"Probiotics and synbiotics are used to treat chronic illnesses due to their roles 
in immune system modulation and anti-inflammatory response. They have been shown 
to reduce inflammation in a number of immune-related disorders, including 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and 
chronic inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis 
(AD). Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 
(F. prausnitzii) are two different types of bacteria that play a significant 
part in this function. It has been established that Akkermansia and 
Faecalibacterium are abundant in normal populations and have protective benefits 
on digestive health while also enhancing the immune system, metabolism, and gut 
barrier of the host. They have the potential to be a therapeutic target in 
diseases connected to the microbiota, such as immunological disorders and cancer 
immunotherapy. There has not been a review of the anti-inflammatory effects of 
Akkermansia and Faecalibacterium, particularly in immunological diseases. In 
this review, we highlight the most recent scientific findings regarding A. 
muciniphila and F. prausnitzii as two significant gut microbiota for microbiome 
alterations and seek to provide cutting-edge insight in terms of 
microbiome-targeted therapies as promising preventive and therapeutic tools in 
immune-related diseases and cancer immunotherapy."
1501,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a growing public health challenge, featuring a 
multifactorial etiology and complex host-environment interactions. Recently, 
increasing evidence has pointed to the role of the gut microbiota in CRC 
development and progression. To explore the role of gut microbes in CRC, we 
retrieved metagenomic data from 156 stools from the European Nucleotide Archive 
database and mapped them against the VFDB database for virulence factors (VFs). 
GO annotations of VFs and KEGG pathways were then performed to predict the 
microbial functions and define functional pathways enriched in the 
tumor-associated microbiota. Interestingly, 306 VFs were detected in the 
metagenomic data. We revealed the enrichment of adenomas with VFs involved in 
cell adhesion, whereas in the early stages of CRC they were enriched in both 
adhesins and isochorismatase. Advanced stages of CRC were enriched with 
microbial siderophores, especially enterobactin, which was significantly 
associated with isochorismate synthase. We highlighted higher abundances of 
porins and transporters involved in antibiotic resistance and the development of 
biofilm in advanced stages of CRC. Most VFs detected in CRC, particularly in 
advanced stages, were shown to be included in siderophore biosynthesis pathways. 
This enrichment of predicted VFs supports the key role of the gut microbiota in 
the disease."
1502,"As a Gram-positive cocci existing in nature, Staphylococcus has a variety of 
species, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, etc. 
Growing evidence reveals that Staphylococcus is closely related to the 
occurrence and development of various cancers. On the one hand, cancer patients 
are more likely to suffer from bacterial infection and antibiotic-resistant 
strain infection compared to healthy controls. On the other hand, there exists 
an association between staphylococcal infection and carcinogenesis. 
Staphylococcus often plays a pathogenic role and evades the host immune system 
through surface adhesion molecules, α-hemolysin, PVL (Panton-Valentine 
leukocidin), SEs (staphylococcal enterotoxins), SpA (staphylococcal protein A), 
TSST-1 (Toxic shock syndrom toxin-1) and other factors. Staphylococcal nucleases 
(SNases) are extracellular nucleases that serve as genomic markers for 
Staphylococcus aureus. Interestingly, a human homologue of SNases, SND1 
(staphylococcal nuclease and Tudor domain-containing 1), has been recognized as 
an oncoprotein. This review is the first to summarize the reported basic and 
clinical evidence on staphylococci and neoplasms. Investigations on the 
correlation between Staphylococcus and the occurrence, development, diagnosis 
and treatment of breast, skin, oral, colon and other cancers, are made from the 
perspectives of various virulence factors and SND1."
1503,"The targeted delivery of cancer immunotherapies has increased noticeably in 
recent years. Recent advancements in immunotherapy, particularly in blocking the 
immune checkpoints (ICs) axis, have shown favorable treatment outcomes for 
multiple types of cancer including melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSLC). Engineered micromachines, including microparticles, and nanoplatforms 
(organic and inorganic), functionalized with immune agonists can effectively 
deliver immune-targeting molecules to solid tumors. This review focuses on the 
nanomaterial-based strategies that have shown promise in identifying and 
targeting various immunological markers in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for 
cancer diagnosis and therapy. Nanomaterials-based cancer immunotherapy has 
improved treatment outcomes by triggering an immune response in the TME. 
Evaluating the expression levels of ICs in the TME also could potentially aid in 
diagnosing patients who would respond to IC blockade therapy. Detecting 
immunological checkpoints in the TME using noninvasive imaging systems via 
tailored nanosensors improves the identification of patient outcomes in 
immuno-oncology (IO). To enhance patient-specific analysis, lab-on-chip (LOC) 
technology is a rapid, cost-effective, and accurate way of recapitulating the 
TME. Such novel nanomaterial-based technologies have been of great interest for 
testing immunotherapies and assessing biomarkers. Finally, we provide a 
perspective on the developments in artificial intelligence tools to facilitate 
ICs-based nano theranostics toward cancer immunotherapy."
1504,"Separation and isolation of suspended submicron particles is fundamental to a 
wide range of applications, including desalination, chemical processing, and 
medical diagnostics. Ion concentration polarization (ICP), an electrokinetic 
phenomenon in micro-nano interfaces, has gained attention due to its unique 
ability to manipulate molecules or particles in suspension and solution. Less 
well understood, though, is the ability of this phenomenon to generate 
circulatory fluid flow, and how this enables and enhances continuous particle 
capture. Here, we perform a comprehensive study of a low-voltage ICP, 
demonstrating a new electrokinetic method for extracting submicron particles via 
flow-enhanced particle redirection. To do so, a 2D-FEM model solves the 
Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation coupled with the Navier-Stokes and continuity 
equations. Four distinct operational modes (Allowed, Blocked, Captured, and 
Dodged) were recognized as a function of the particle's charges and sizes, 
resulting in the capture or release from ICP-induced vortices, with the critical 
particle dimensions determined by appropriately tuning inlet flow rates (200-800 
[µm/s]) and applied voltages (0-2.5 [V]). It is found that vortices are 
generated above a non-dimensional ICP-induced velocity of U*=1, which represents 
an equilibrium between ICP velocity and lateral flow velocity. It was also found 
that in the case of multi-target separation, the surface charge of the particle, 
rather than a particle's size, is the primary determinant of particle 
trajectory. These findings contribute to a better understanding of ICP-based 
particle separation and isolation, as well as laying the foundations for the 
rational design and optimization of ICP-based sorting systems."
1505,"With the development of artificial intelligence technology and computer hardware 
functions, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful auxiliary tool for 
medical image analysis. This study was an attempt to use statistical methods to 
analyze studies related to the detection, segmentation, and classification of 
breast cancer in pathological images. After an analysis of 107 articles on the 
application of deep learning to pathological images of breast cancer, this study 
is divided into three directions based on the types of results they report: 
detection, segmentation, and classification. We introduced and analyzed models 
that performed well in these three directions and summarized the related work 
from recent years. Based on the results obtained, the significant ability of 
deep learning in the application of breast cancer pathological images can be 
recognized. Furthermore, in the classification and detection of pathological 
images of breast cancer, the accuracy of deep learning algorithms has surpassed 
that of pathologists in certain circumstances. Our study provides a 
comprehensive review of the development of breast cancer pathological 
imaging-related research and provides reliable recommendations for the structure 
of deep learning network models in different application scenarios."
1506,"Holographic microwave imaging (HMI) has been proposed for early breast cancer 
diagnosis. Automatically classifying benign and malignant tumors in microwave 
images is challenging. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated 
excellent image classification and tumor detection performance. This study 
investigates the feasibility of using the CNN architecture to identify and 
classify HMI images. A modified AlexNet with transfer learning was investigated 
to automatically identify, classify, and quantify four and five different HMI 
breast images. Various pre-trained networks, including ResNet18, GoogLeNet, 
ResNet101, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201, SqueezeNet, Inception v3, AlexNet, and 
Inception-ResNet-v2, were investigated to evaluate the proposed network. The 
proposed network achieved high classification accuracy using small training 
datasets (966 images) and fast training times."
1507,"Ovarian tumors/cancers are threatening women's health worldwide, which demands 
high-performance detection methods and accurate strategies to effectively 
detect, diagnose and treat them. Here, we report a nanographene oxide 
particle-functionalized microfluidic fluorescence biosensor to simultaneously 
detect four biomarkers, CA125, HE4, CEA and APF, for ovarian tumor/cancer 
diagnosis. The developed biosensor exhibits good selectivity and a large 
biomarker detection range with a limit of detection of 0.01 U/mL for CA125 and 
~1 pg/mL for HE4, CEA and APF. The current results indicate that (1) the 
proposed biosensor is a promising tool for the simultaneous detection of 
multiple biomarkers in ovarian tumors/cancer and (2) CA125 and HE4 are strong 
indicators, AFP may be helpful, and CEA is a weak biomarker for ovarian 
tumor/cancer diagnosis. The proposed biosensor would be a potential tool, and an 
analytical approach for the simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers will 
provide a new strategy for the early screening, diagnosis and treatment of 
ovarian tumors/cancers, as well as other cancers."
1508,"The present perspective article proposes that cachexia, muscle wasting in 
cancer, is mediated by dysregulated phosphate metabolism and phosphate toxicity 
that can damage tissues in most major organ systems. A diet high in phosphorus 
fed to mice deficient in klotho, a cofactor that regulates phosphate metabolism, 
accelerates aging, sarcopenia, general organ atrophy, kyphosis, and 
osteoporosis. Similar effects are seen in phenotypes of mutant p53 mice that 
overexpress the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Although mutant p53 mice do not 
develop tumors compared to wild-type mice, mutant p53 mice have shorter mean 
lifespans. Furthermore, tumorigenesis is associated with the sequestration of 
excessive inorganic phosphate, and dangerous levels of phosphate are released 
into circulation during tumor lysis syndrome. In total, this evidence implies 
that tumorigenesis may be a compensatory mechanism that provides protective 
effects against systemic exposure to dysregulated phosphate metabolism and 
phosphate toxicity related to cachexia in cancer. Moreover, the hypothetical 
protection against phosphate toxicity afforded by tumorigenesis also provides an 
alternate explanation for putative tumor evasion of the immune system. Insights 
proposed in this perspective paper provide new directions for further research, 
with potential to develop novel interventions and clinical applications that 
modify dietary phosphate intake to reduce cachexia in cancer patients."
1509,"The genus Lycium belongs to the Solanaceae family and comprises more than 90 
species distributed by diverse continents. Lycium barbarum is by far the most 
studied and has been advertised as a ""superfood"" with healthy properties. In 
contrast, there are some Lycium species which have been poorly studied, although 
used by native populations. L. europaeum, L. intricatum and 
L.&amp;nbsp;schweinfurthii, found particularly in the Mediterranean region, are 
examples of scarcely investigated species. The chemical composition and the 
biological properties of these species were reviewed. The biological properties 
of L. barbarum fruits are mainly attributed to polysaccharides, particularly 
complex glycoproteins with different compositions. Studies regarding these 
metabolites are practically absent in L. europaeum, L. intricatum and 
L.&amp;nbsp;schweinfurthii. The metabolites isolated and identified belong 
mainly to polyphenols, fatty acids, polysaccharides, carotenoids, sterols, 
terpenoids, tocopherols, and alkaloids (L. europaeum); phenolic acids, lignans, 
flavonoids, polyketides, glycosides, terpenoids, tyramine derivatives among 
other few compounds (L.&amp;nbsp;schweinfurthii), and esters of phenolic acids, 
glycosides, fatty acids, terpenoids/phytosterols, among other few compounds (L. 
intricatum). The biological properties (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and 
cytotoxic against some cancer cell lines) found for these species were 
attributed to some metabolites belonging to those compound groups. Results of 
the study concluded that investigations concerning L. europaeum, L. intricatum 
and L.&amp;nbsp;schweinfurthii are scarce, in contrast to L. barbarum."
1510,"We conducted a scoping review to map available evidence about the health impact 
of gut microbiota-derived metabolites. We searched PubMed and Embase for studies 
that assessed the health impact of ten metabolites on any health condition: 
deoxycholate or deoxycholic acid (DCA), lithocholate or lithocholic acid (LCA), 
glycolithocholate or glycolithocholic acid, glycodeoxycholate or 
glycodeoxycholic acid, tryptamine, putrescine, d-alanine, urolithins, 
N-acetylmannosamine, and phenylacetylglutamine. We identified 352 eligible 
studies with 168,072 participants. Most (326, 92.6%) were case-control studies, 
followed by cohort studies (14, 4.0%), clinical trials (8, 2.3%), and 
cross-sectional studies (6, 1.7%). Most studies assessed the following 
associations: DCA on hepatobiliary disorders (64 studies, 7976 participants), 
colorectal cancer (19 studies, 7461 participants), and other digestive disorders 
(27 studies, 2463 participants); LCA on hepatobiliary disorders (34 studies, 
4297 participants), colorectal cancers (14 studies, 4955 participants), and 
other digestive disorders (26 studies, 2117 participants); putrescine on 
colorectal cancers (16 studies, 94,399 participants) and cancers excluding 
colorectal and hepatobiliary cancers (42 studies, 4250 participants). There is a 
need to conduct more prospective studies, including clinical trials. Moreover, 
we identified metabolites and conditions for which systemic reviews are 
warranted to characterize the direction and magnitude of metabolite-disease 
associations."
1511,"Liposarcoma (LPS) is a rare and heterogeneous malignancy of adipocytic origin. 
Well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) 
are two of the most common subtypes, showing similar genetic characterizations 
but distinct biological behaviors and clinical prognosis. Compared to WDLPS, 
DDLPS is more aggressive and has the potential of metastasis, as the malignant 
adipocytic tumor's metabolic changes may have taken place during the 
tumorigenesis of LPSs. Therefore, to investigate the lipid alterations between 
the two subtypes, high-resolution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) based untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed onto LPS tissues 
from 6 WDLPS and 7 DDLPS patients. The lipidomic analysis showed the upregulated 
phosphatidylcholines and phosphoethanolamines in DDLPS, and the upregulated 
triglycerides and diglycerides in WDLPS, which might be due to the uncompleted 
adipocytic dedifferentiation leading to such tumorigenesis. Such a finding was 
also confirmed by the similarity comparison of two LPS subtypes to the 
transcriptome of stromal vascular fraction at different differentiation stages. 
Transcriptomic analysis also demonstrated that metabolic pathways including the 
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were upregulated in WDLPS compared to DDLPS. 
Therefore, the cell line LPS853 was treated with the PPP inhibitor 
6-aminonicotinamide ex vivo and the proliferation and invasion of LPS853 was 
significantly promoted by PPP inhibition, suggesting the potential role of PPP 
in the development and differentiation of LPS. In conclusion, this study 
described the altered lipid profiles of WDLPS and DDLPS for the first time, 
revealing the different differentiation stages of the two subtypes and providing 
a potential metabolic target for LPS treatment."
1512,"Glioma is the most prevalent primary central nervous system malignant tumor, 
with high heterogeneity observed among different grades; therefore, non-invasive 
prediction of prognosis could improve the clinical management of patients with 
glioma. 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can estimate metabolite levels 
non-invasively. Multiple studies have investigated its prognostic value in 
gliomas; however, no consensus has been reached. PubMed and Embase databases 
were searched up to 20 October 2022 to identify studies investigating the 
prognostic value of metabolites using 1H-MRS in patients with glioma. 
Heterogeneity across studies was evaluated using the Q and I2 tests, and a 
fixed- or random-effects model was used to estimate the combined overall hazard 
ratio (HR). Funnel plots and Begg tests were used to assess publication bias. 
Higher choline levels were associated with shorter overall survival (HR = 2.69, 
95% CI, 1.92-2.99; p &lt; 0.001) and progression-free survival (HR = 2.20, 95% 
CI, 1.16-4.17; p = 0.02) in all patients; however, in pediatric gliomas, it 
showed no significant correlation with overall survival (HR = 1.60, 95% CI, 
0.97-2.64; p = 0.06). The estimated choline level by 1H-MRS could be used to 
non-invasively predict the prognosis of patients with adult gliomas, and more 
studies are needed to evaluate the prognostic value of other metabolites."
1513,"Metabolism is a series of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms, 
providing energy required for cellular processes and building blocks for 
cellular constituents of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. 
Cancer cells frequently reprogram their metabolic behaviors to adapt their rapid 
proliferation and altered tumor microenvironments. Not only aerobic glycolysis 
(also termed the Warburg effect) but also altered mitochondrial metabolism, 
amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism play important roles for cancer 
growth and aggressiveness. Thus, the mechanistic elucidation of these metabolic 
changes is invaluable for understanding the pathogenesis of cancers and 
developing novel metabolism-targeted therapies. In this review article, we first 
provide an overview of essential metabolic mechanisms, and then summarize the 
recent findings of metabolic reprogramming and the recent reports of 
metabolism-targeted therapies for thyroid cancer."
1514,"In recent years, with the drastic increase in worldwide pollution rates, 
considerable attention has been paid to the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
that might lead to serious health problems, e.g., cancer. As there appears to be 
a notable lack of research on the pollution (specifically, VOCs) of water bodies 
in Morocco, we aimed to assess the occurrence of VOCs in some uncontrolled 
springs in the north of Morocco that have not been previously investigated. We 
also discuss the estimation of health risks posed by ingestion and dermal 
contact as well as the different potential origins of these pollutants. For this 
purpose, water samples were collected from twenty-six sampling sites and were 
analyzed via headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). Out of the 60 suspected VOCs, 
a total of 15 compounds belonging to five distinct groups were identified and 
quantified. Among them, fumigants, solvents, and gasoline hydrocarbons were the 
most abundant groups, with proportions of 40%, 26.7%, and 20%, respectively. A 
heatmap clustered the provinces based on their degree of pollution, while a 
dendrogram was used to classify the studied springs into six main groups. 
Regarding carcinogenic risk, all the samples were safe for consumption as well 
as for dermal contact, except for S17, S18, and S8, and S19, which might present 
a severe threat to inhabitants due to their contents of, respectively, 
naphthalene (2.1 × 10-3), chloroform (2.5 × 10-4), and cis and 
trans-dichlropropene (1.61 × 10-4 and 1.11 × 10-4). Our investigation revealed 
several anthropogenic sources of water contamination, which could aid 
authorities in limiting contamination spread in water bodies."
1515,"Tumours are composed of various cancer cell populations with different mutation 
profiles, phenotypes and metabolism that cause them to react to drugs in diverse 
manners. Increasing the resolution of metabolic models based on single-cell 
expression data will provide deeper insight into such metabolic differences and 
improve the predictive power of the models. scFASTCORMICS is a network 
contextualization algorithm that builds multi-cell population genome-scale 
models from single-cell RNAseq data. The models contain a subnetwork for each 
cell population in a tumour, allowing to capture metabolic variations between 
these clusters. The subnetworks are connected by a union compartment that 
permits to simulate metabolite exchanges between cell populations in the 
microenvironment. scFASTCORMICS uses Pareto optimization to simultaneously 
maximise the compactness, completeness and specificity of the reconstructed 
metabolic models. scFASTCORMICS is implemented in MATLAB and requires the 
installation of the COBRA toolbox, rFASTCORMICS and the IBM CPLEX solver."
1516,"Cytotoxicity of de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) metabolites is critical to the 
pathogenesis of three known and one putative autosomal recessive disorder 
affecting DNPS. These rare disorders are caused by biallelic mutations in the 
DNPS genes phosphoribosylformylglycineamidine synthase (PFAS), 
phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxylase/phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide 
synthase (PAICS), adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), and aminoimidazole carboxamide 
ribonucleotide transformylase/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (ATIC) and 
are clinically characterized by developmental abnormalities, psychomotor 
retardation, and nonspecific neurological impairment. At a biochemical level, 
loss of function of specific mutated enzymes results in elevated levels of DNPS 
ribosides in body fluids. The main pathogenic effect is attributed to the 
accumulation of DNPS ribosides, which are postulated to be toxic to the 
organism. Therefore, we decided to characterize the uptake and flux of several 
DNPS metabolites in HeLa cells and the impact of DNPS metabolites to viability 
of cancer cell lines and primary skin fibroblasts. We treated cells with DNPS 
metabolites and followed their flux in purine synthesis and degradation. In this 
study, we show for the first time the transport of formylglycinamide ribotide 
(FGAR), aminoimidazole ribotide (AIR), succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide 
ribotide (SAICAR), and aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribotide (AICAR) into cells and 
their flux in DNPS and the degradation pathway. We found diminished cell 
viability mostly in the presence of FGAR and AIR. Our results suggest that 
direct cellular toxicity of DNPS metabolites may not be the primary pathogenetic 
mechanism in these disorders."
1517,"After SARS-CoV-2 infection, the molecular phenoreversion of the immunological 
response and its associated metabolic dysregulation are required for a full 
recovery of the patient. This process is patient-dependent due to the manifold 
possibilities induced by virus severity, its phylogenic evolution and the 
vaccination status of the population. We have here investigated the natural 
history of COVID-19 disease at the molecular level, characterizing the metabolic 
and immunological phenoreversion over time in large cohorts of hospitalized 
severe patients (n = 886) and non-hospitalized recovered patients that 
self-reported having passed the disease (n = 513). Non-hospitalized recovered 
patients do not show any metabolic fingerprint associated with the disease or 
immune alterations. Acute patients are characterized by the metabolic and 
lipidomic dysregulation that accompanies the exacerbated immunological response, 
resulting in a slow recovery time with a maximum probability of around 62 days. 
As a manifestation of the heterogeneity in the metabolic phenoreversion, age and 
severity become factors that modulate their normalization time which, in turn, 
correlates with changes in the atherogenesis-associated chemokine MCP-1. Our 
results are consistent with a model where the slow metabolic normalization in 
acute patients results in enhanced atherosclerotic risk, in line with the recent 
observation of an elevated number of cardiovascular episodes found in 
post-COVID-19 cohorts."
1518,"Previous studies have reported that different blood groups are associated with 
the risk of chronic degenerative diseases that mainly involve inflammation and 
neoplastic processes. We investigate the relationship between blood groups and 
the erythroprotective effect of extracts from Navicula incerta against oxidative 
damage as a proposal to develop drugs designed for people with a specific blood 
type related to chronic pathology. The study was carried out through the 
elucidation of the erythroprotective potential, anti-inflammatory and 
antiproliferative activity of Navicula incerta. Research suggests that the 
presence or absence of certain blood groups increases or decreases the abilities 
of certain phytochemicals to inhibit oxidative stress, which is related to the 
systemic inflammatory response involved in the development of different types of 
cancer. The pigment-rich extracts from Navicula incerta inhibit ROO•- induced 
oxidative stress in human erythrocytes on the A RhD+ve antigen without 
compromising the structure of the cell membrane. This result is very important, 
since the A antigen is related to the susceptibility of contracting prostate 
cancer. Similarly, it was possible to inhibit the proliferation of cervical 
(HeLa) and prostate (PC-3) carcinoma. The combinatorial analysis of different 
biological activities can help design phytochemicals as new candidates for 
preventive drugs treating the chronic degenerative diseases associated with a 
specific blood group."
1519,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive technique for measuring 
metabolite concentration. It can be used for preclinical small animal brain 
studies using rodents to provide information about neurodegenerative diseases 
and metabolic disorders. However, data acquisition from small volumes in a 
limited scan time is technically challenging due to its inherently low 
sensitivity. To mitigate this problem, this study investigated the feasibility 
of a low-rank denoising method in enhancing the quality of single voxel 
multinuclei (31P and 1H) MRS data at 9.4 T. Performance was evaluated using in 
vivo MRS data from a normal mouse brain (31P and 1H) and stroke mouse model (1H) 
by comparison with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), Cramer-Rao lower bounds 
(CRLBs), and metabolite concentrations of a linear combination of model analysis 
results. In 31P MRS data, low-rank denoising resulted in improved SNRs and 
reduced metabolite quantification uncertainty compared with the original data. 
In 1H MRS data, the method also improved the SNRs, CRLBs, but it performed 
better for 31P MRS data with relatively simpler patterns compared to the 1H MRS 
data. Therefore, we suggest that the low-rank denoising method can improve 
spectra SNR and metabolite quantification uncertainty in single-voxel in vivo 
31P and 1H MRS data, and it might be more effective for 31P MRS data. The main 
contribution of this study is that we demonstrated the effectiveness of the 
low-rank denoising method on small-volume single-voxel MRS data. We anticipate 
that our results will be useful for the precise quantification of 
low-concentration metabolites, further reducing data acquisition voxel size, and 
scan time in preclinical MRS studies."
1520,"Background: In the US in 2021, 76,080 kidney cancers are expected and &gt;80% 
are renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). Along with excess fat, metabolic dysfunction 
is implicated in RCC etiology. To identify RCC-associated metabolites, we 
conducted a 1:1 matched case-control study nested within the Prostate, Lung, 
Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Methods: We measured 522 
serum metabolites in 267 cases/control pairs. Cases were followed for a median 
7.1 years from blood draw to diagnosis. Using conditional logistic regression, 
we computed adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
comparing risk between 90th and 10th percentiles of log metabolite intensity, 
with the significance threshold at a false discovery rate &lt;0.20. Results: 
Four metabolites were inversely associated with risk of RCC during 
follow-up-C38:4 PI, C34:0 PC, C14:0 SM, and C16:1 SM (ORs ranging from 
0.33-0.44). Two were positively associated with RCC risk-C3-DC-CH3 carnitine and 
C5 carnitine (ORs = 2.84 and 2.83, respectively). These results were robust when 
further adjusted for metabolic risk factors (body mass index (BMI), physical 
activity, diabetes/hypertension history). Metabolites associated with RCC had 
weak correlations (|r| &lt; 0.2) with risk factors of BMI, physical activity, 
smoking, alcohol, and diabetes/hypertension history. In mutually adjusted 
models, three metabolites (C38:4 PI, C14:0 SM, and C3-DC-CH3 carnitine) were 
independently associated with RCC risk. Conclusions: Serum concentrations of six 
metabolites were associated with RCC risk, and three of these had independent 
associations from the mutually adjusted model. These metabolites may point 
toward new biological pathways of relevance to this malignancy."
1521,"Ovarian cancer (OC), and particularly epithelial OC (EOC), is an increasing 
challenge for women. Circulating lipids play different roles in the occurrence 
and development of OC, but no causal relationship has been confirmed. We used 
two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the genetic effects of 
circulating Apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), Apolipoprotein B (APOB), high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and 
triglyc-erides (TG) on EOC risks based on summary data obtained from the UK 
Biobank and the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. We used the 
inverse-variance weight as the main statistical method and the MR-Egger, 
weighted median, and MR-PRESSO for sensitivity analysis. A 1-SD increment in HDL 
gave odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of OR = 0.80 (95% CI: 
0.69-0.93), OR = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.66-0.90), and OR = 0.76 (95% CI: 0.63-0.90) for 
low malignant potential OC (LMPOC), low-grade low malignant OC (LGLMSOC), and 
low malignant serous OC (LMSOC), respectively. Genetic liability due to TG was 
associated with an increased risk of LGLMSOC and LGSOC and a suggestive 
association with an increased risk of LMSOC (p = 0.001, p = 0.007, and p = 
0.027, respectively). Circulating HDL was negatively associated with the risk of 
LMPOC, LGLMSOC, and LMSOC, while elevated circulating TG levels genetically 
predicted an increased risk of LGLMSOC and LGSOC. Further research is needed to 
investigate the causal effects of lipids on EOC and potential intervention and 
therapeutic targets."
1522,"Extracellular vesicles (EV) are membrane vesicles surrounded by a lipid bilayer 
membrane and include microvesicles, apoptotic bodies, exosomes, and exomeres. 
Exosome-encapsulated microRNAs (miRNAs) released from cancer cells are involved 
in the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells via angiogenesis. On the 
other hand, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, which is being employed in 
regenerative medicine owing to the ability of MSCs to differentiate into various 
cells, is due to humoral factors, including messenger RNA (mRNA), miRNAs, 
proteins, and lipids, which are encapsulated in exosomes derived from 
transplanted cells. New treatments that advocate cell-free therapy using 
MSC-derived exosomes will significantly improve clinical practice. Therefore, 
using highly purified exosomes that perform their original functions is 
desirable. In this review, we summarized advances in the purification, 
modification, and application of EVs as novel strategies to treat some diseases."
1523,"Nanoparticles are explored as drug carriers with the promise for the treatment 
of diseases to increase the efficacy and also reduce side effects sometimes seen 
with conventional drugs. To accomplish this goal, drugs are encapsulated in or 
conjugated to the nanocarriers and selectively delivered to their targets. 
Potential applications include immunization, the delivery of anti-cancer drugs 
to tumours, antibiotics to infections, targeting resistant bacteria, and 
delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. Despite this great promise and 
potential, drug delivery systems have yet to be established, mainly due to their 
limitations in physical instability and rapid clearance by the host's immune 
response. Recent interest has been taken in using red blood cells (RBC) as drug 
carriers due to their naturally long circulation time, flexible structure, and 
direct access to many target sites. This includes coating of nanoparticles with 
the membrane of red blood cells, and the fabrication and manipulation of 
liposomes made of the red blood cells' cytoplasmic membrane. The properties of 
these erythrocyte liposomes, such as charge and elastic properties, can be tuned 
through the incorporation of synthetic lipids to optimize physical properties 
and the loading efficiency and retention of different drugs. Specificity can be 
established through the anchorage of antigens and antibodies in the liposomal 
membrane to achieve targeted delivery. Although still at an early stage, this 
erythrocyte-based platform shows first promising results in vitro and in animal 
studies. However, their full potential in terms of increased efficacy and side 
effect minimization still needs to be explored in vivo."
1524,"Background. Oncogenic osteomalacia (OO), also known as tumor-induced 
osteomalacia (TIO), is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome caused by mesechymal 
tumors secreting fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Common in middle age, 
these tumors are often disclosed by progressive generalized bone pain and muscle 
weakness, along with an altered biochemical profile. Despite its characteristic 
presentation, the disease is often underrecognized with delayed onset of 
surgical or pharmacological intervention that can have serious repercussions on 
the patients' health and quality of life. Case presentation. We describe the 
case of a 65-year-old Caucasian man presenting TIO with intracranial and spinal 
localizations and Fanconi-like aminoaciduria. The condition was misdiagnosed and 
mistreated for three years, leading to loss of self-sufficiency and depression. 
Following proper identification, the spinal mass was excised with complete 
remission of the functional symptoms. As it was not possible to remove the 
intracranial lesion, the patient was treated conservatively with calcitriol and 
phosphorous supplements that granted good metabolic control up to the time of a 
recent follow-up visit (at 5 years). Conclusions. The finding of an altered 
amino acid profile, not usually reported in these cases, should prompt 
clinicians to a wider usage of these molecules as suitable candidates for 
metabolic diseases. In addition to providing central information, they are easy 
to obtain and inexpensive to analyze. Such determination could help to speed up 
the diagnostic process, as a long-lasting history of misdiagnosis and 
mistreatments can lead primarily to clinical worsening, but also to the use of 
expensive, useless medications with side effects that contribute to poor patient 
health."
1525,"Background: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive and rare 
malignant pleural tumor. Methods: MPM patients diagnosed in Beijing Chaoyang 
Hospital and Beijing Tongren Hospital were the focus of this study. We collected 
and analyzed the histological, radiological, and metabolic features of MPM 
patients. At the same time, Cox univariable and multivariable analyses were used 
to explore the laboratory risk factors affecting the prognosis of MPM patients. 
Results: A total of 129 MPM patients were included in this study. MPM includes 
three main histological subtypes: epithelioid, sarcomatoid and biphasic. Among 
them, epithelial subtypes accounted for the highest proportion. Calretinin, 
Wilms' tumor gene (WT1), cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), and D2-40 were the most useful 
mesothelial markers to support a MPM diagnosis. The imaging features of MPM 
patients are pleural thickening and pleural effusion. In PET-CT, the affected 
pleura showed obvious high uptake of tracer, and the degree was related to the 
specific subtype. The median follow-up time was 55.0 (30.0, 94.0) months. A 
total of 92 (71.3%) patients died during follow-up. The median survival time of 
patients was 21.0 (9.0, 48.0) months. The Cox multivariable analysis showed that 
age [hazard ratio (HR), 1.824; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.159-2.872; p = 
0.009; uncorrected], ESR (HR, 2.197; 95% CI 1.318-3.664; p = 0.003; with 
Bonferroni correction), lymphocytes (HR, 0.436; 95% CI 0.258-0.737; p = 0.002; 
with Bonferroni correction), platelets (HR, 1.802; 95% CI 1.084-2.997; p = 
0.023; uncorrected) and total protein (HR, 0.625; 95% CI 0.394-0.990; p = 0.045; 
uncorrected) were independent risk factors for prognosis, after adjusting for 
confounding factors. Conclusions: Age, ESR, lymphocytes, platelets and total 
protein may be related to the prognosis of MPM patients. Summarizing the 
histological, radiological, and metabolic features of MPM patients in the two 
centers can increase clinicians' understanding of this rare tumor."
1526,"Background and Objectives: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has recently 
increased its application in the treatment of gynecological malignancies. 
Despite technological and surgical advances, urologic complications (UC) are 
still the main concern in gynecology surgery. Current literature reports a wide 
range of urinary tract injuries, and consistent scientific evidence is still 
lacking or dated. This study aims to report a large single-center experience of 
urinary complications during laparoscopic hysterectomy for gynecologic oncologic 
disease. Materials and Methods: All patients who underwent laparoscopic 
hysterectomy for gynecologic malignancy at the Department of Medicine and 
Surgery of the University Hospital of Parma from 2017 to 2021 were 
retrospectively included. Women with endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, 
ovarian cancer, uterine sarcoma, or borderline ovarian tumors were included. 
Patients undergoing robotic surgery with incomplete anatomopathological data or 
patients lost during follow-up were excluded from the analysis. Intraoperative 
and postoperative UC were analyzed and ranked according to the Clavien-Dindo 
classification. Results: Two hundred-sixty patients were included in the study: 
180 endometrial cancer, 18 cervical cancer, nine ovarian cancer, two uterine 
sarcomas, and 60 borderline ovarian tumors. Nine (3.5%) UCs were reported (five 
intraoperative and four postoperative complications). No anamnestic variables 
showed a statistical correlation with the surgical complication in the 
univariable analyses. C1 radical hysterectomy, a higher FIGO stage, and 
postoperative adjuvant treatment (p-value = 0.001, p-value = 0.046, and p-value 
= 0.046, respectively) were independent risk factors associated with the 
occurrence of UC. Conclusions: The urological complication rates in patients 
with oncological disease are relatively rare events in the expert hands of 
dedicated surgeons. Radical hysterectomy, FIGO stage, and adjuvant treatment are 
independent factors associated with urinary complications."
1527,"Background and Objectives: Identification and targeting of membrane proteins in 
tumor cells is one of the key steps in the development of cancer drugs. The 
receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor (ROR) type 1 is a type-I 
transmembrane protein expressed in various cancer tissues, which is in contrast 
to its limited expression in normal tissues. These characteristics make ROR1 a 
candidate target for cancer treatment. This study aimed to identify the 
prognostic value of ROR1 expression in cancers. Materials and Methods: We 
conducted a comprehensive systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed) 
from their inception to September 2021. The included studies assessed the effect 
of ROR1 on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Hazard 
ratios (HR) from collected data were pooled in a meta-analysis using Revman 
version 5.4 with generic inverse-variance and random effects modeling. Results: 
A total of fourteen studies were included in the final analysis. ROR1 was 
associated with worse OS (HR 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50-2.54; p 
&lt; 0.001) with heterogeneity. The association between poor OS and ROR1 
expression was high in endometrial cancer, followed by ovarian cancer, and 
diffuse large B cell lymphoma. In addition, ROR1 was associated with poor PFS 
(HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.60-2.10; p &lt; 0.001), but heterogeneity was not 
statistically significant. In subgroup analysis, high ROR1 expression showed a 
significantly higher rate of advanced stage or lymph node metastasis. 
Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence that ROR1 expression is 
associated with adverse outcome in cancer survival. This result highlights ROR1 
as a target for developmental therapeutics in cancers."
1528,"Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the liver is a rare disease that is 
difficult to diagnose until the pathology is confirmed. The age of the patients 
generally ranges from 18 to 83 years. The pathogenesis of primary SCC of the 
liver remains unclear and therapeutic guidelines have not yet been established. 
The overall survival rate may be less than 1 year. The prognosis for patients 
without surgery is worse than that for patients who undergo surgery. Herein, we 
report a case of primary SCC of the liver that responded well to intravenous 
carboplatin and 5-flurouracil (5-FU) with the aim of providing an alternative 
therapeutic option. A 61-year-old woman with no history of alcohol use disorder, 
cirrhosis, exposure to hepatotoxic chemicals, or a remarkable family history 
presented to our hospital with a complaint of epigastric pain, poor appetite, 
and fatigue, which had occurred 3 days before presentation. Blood tests revealed 
levels of alpha-fetoprotein of &lt;2.0 ng/mL, carcinoembryonic antigen of 4.39 
ng/mL, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 of 1306.15 U/mL, CA 125 of 66.3 U/mL, CA 
153 of 19.7 U/mL, and SCC antigen of 8.5 ng/mL. Computed tomography scans of the 
abdomen showed a 5.8-cm lobulated soft-tissue mass with central necrosis in 
segment 6 of the liver, which caused compression of the common hepatic duct. 
Pathological examination of the masses revealed squamous cell carcinoma with 
focal glandular differentiation. The patient underwent palliative chemotherapy 
with intravenous carboplatin 150 mg (day 1) and 5-FU 1000 mg (days 1-4) instead 
of surgery. After two cycles of chemotherapy, jaundice and liver function 
improved. The patient was discharged in stable condition and was followed up in 
our outpatient department. Although the patient refused to undergo surgery, no 
tumor recurrence or distant metastasis was found during the 8-month follow-up 
period. This report highlights that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin 
and 5-FU can be considered for primary SCC of the liver before a liver 
resection."
1529,"Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted health systems 
worldwide, particularly cancer care. Because the actual implications of these 
changes on gynecological oncology healthcare are still unclear, we aim to 
evaluate the impact of this pandemic on the diagnosis and management of 
gynecological cancer. Materials and Methods: This is a single-center 
retrospective observational study, including patients diagnosed with 
gynecological malignancies between January 2019 and December 2021. Patients were 
included into three groups based on the timing of cancer diagnosis: pre-pandemic 
(2019), pandemic with high restrictions (2020) and pandemic recovery (2021). 
Results: Overall, 234 patients were diagnosed with gynecological cancer during 
the period of study. A decrease in the number of newly diagnosed cervical 
cancers and other rare tumors (leiomyosarcoma, invasive hydatidiform mole) was 
apparent in 2020. Some aggressive histological types of endometrial and ovarian 
cancer were more commonly diagnosed in the pandemic recovery group (p &lt; 
0.05), although no differences were demonstrated concerning tumor staging in all 
gynecological cancers. The median time between the first multidisciplinary team 
meeting and the treatment initiation was higher after the COVID-19 pandemic in 
endometrial cancer (23.0 vs. 34.0 vs. 36.0 days, p &lt; 0.05). Patients with 
ovarian cancer were more frequently proposed for neoadjuvant therapy in 2020 
compared to the other periods (33.3% vs. 55.0% vs. 10.0% p &lt; 0.05). A 
significant reduction in the laparoscopic approach was observed during 2020 in 
endometrial cancer (32.1% vs. 14.3% vs. 36.4%, p &lt; 0.05). No significant 
differences were registered regarding median hospitalization days or intra- and 
post-operative complications between these periods. Conclusions: The COVID-19 
pandemic had a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of most 
gynecological malignancies, namely, on time to first treatment, chosen 
oncological therapies and surgical approaches. These results suggest important 
clinical and healthcare implications that should be addressed in future 
prospective studies."
1530,"Re-expansion pulmonary edema is a potentially life-threatening situation 
following thoracic surgery of a compromised lung. We report the case of a 
24-year-old female scheduled for a resection of a large intrathoracic desmoid 
tumor that presented with re-expansion pulmonary edema at the conclusion of her 
surgery and discuss the clinical presentation, mechanism and predictors of this 
entity and review similar cases reported in the literature."
1531,"Background and Objectives: A difficulty scoring system was previously developed 
to assess the difficulty of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) for liver tumors; 
however, we need another system for hepatolithiasis. Therefore, we developed a 
novel difficulty scoring system (nDSS) and validated its use for predicting 
postoperative outcomes. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study. 
We used clinical data of 123 patients who underwent LLR for hepatolithiasis 
between 2003 and 2021. We analyzed the data to determine which indices were 
associated with operation time or estimated blood loss (EBL) to measure the 
surgical difficulty. We validated the nDSS in terms of its ability to predict 
postoperative outcomes, namely red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, postoperative 
hospital stay (POHS), and major complications defined as grade ≥IIIa according 
to the Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC). Results: The nDSS included five 
significant indices (range: 5-17; median: 8). The RBC transfusion rate (p &lt; 
0.001), POHS (p = 0.002), and major complication rate (p = 0.002) increased with 
increasing nDSS score. We compared the two groups of patients divided by the 
median nDSS (low: 5-7; high: 8-17). The operation time (210.7 vs. 240.7 min; p 
&lt; 0.001), EBL (281.9 vs. 702.6 mL; p &lt; 0.001), RBC transfusion rate (5.3% 
vs. 37.9%; p &lt; 0.001), POHS (8.0 vs. 13.3 days; p = 0.001), and major 
complication rate (8.8% vs. 25.8%; p = 0.014) were greater in the high group. 
Conclusions: The nDSS can predict the surgical difficulty and outcomes of LLR 
for hepatolithiasis and may help select candidates for the procedure and 
surgical approach."
1532,"Cutaneous leiomyoma is a benign tumor, mainly composed of smooth muscle cells 
and arising from the arrector pili muscle of hair follicles. The diagnosis of 
leiomyomas is of paramount importance, as they can often be associated with 
underlying malignancies (e.g., renal cell carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma) and 
specific genetic mutations. We report the case of a 27-year-old Caucasian male 
patient that presented to our attention with a rare segmental and Zoosteriform 
type II leiomyoma. We performed an analysis of the cutaneous lesions using 
dermoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and histology. We found that, 
using dermoscopy, the leiomyomas showed a dermatofibroma-like appearance with a 
central hypopigmented area, peripheral delicate hyperpigmentation and also 
erythematous areas and ectatic vessels. RCM, although not specific, showed 
groups of hypo-reflective areas distributed in the most superficial papillary 
dermis, which in histology and immunohistochemistry corresponded to the most 
superficial protrusions in the papillary dermis of the tumoral bundles. Finally, 
we discuss the management of patients with multiple leiomyomas and stress the 
fact that, in the cases of multiple leiomyomas, an annual sonography of the 
kidneys associated with dermatological and (in women) gynecological 
consultations are needed to ensure the early identification of an underlying 
tumor. A genetic consultation to detect an eventual FH mutation is recommended, 
but since in some cases the FH result may be negative, the above recommended 
controls remain always of paramount importance."
1533,"Background and Objectives: Benign osseous tumors of the spinal column comprise 
about 10% of all spinal tumors and are rare cause for surgery. However, these 
tumors pose various management challenges and conventional surgery may be 
associated with significant morbidity. Previous reports on minimally invasive 
resection of these lesions are rare. We report a series of patients managed by 
total resection of benign osseous spine tumors using MIS techniques. Surgical 
decisions and technical considerations are discussed. Materials and Methods: A 
retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data of patients who 
underwent minimally invasive surgery for removal of benign osseous vertebral 
tumors. Demographic, clinical and radiographic features, operative details and 
final pathological reports were summarized. Primary outcomes were completeness 
of tumor resection and pain relief assessed by VAS for back and leg pain. 
Secondary outcome measures were recurrence of tumor on repeat post-operative MRI 
and postoperative unstable deformity on standing scoliosis X-rays. Results: This 
series included 32 cases of primary osseous spine tumors resected by minimally 
invasive techniques. There were 17 males and 15 females aged 5-68 years (mean 
23.3). The follow-up period was 8-90 months (mean 32 months) and the 
preoperative symptoms duration was 9-96 months. Axial spinal pain was the 
presenting symptom in all the patients. Five patients also complained about 
radicular pain and four patients had antalgic scoliosis. The tumor involved the 
thoracic spine in 12 cases, the lumbar segment in 11, the cervical in 5 and the 
sacral area in 4 cases. Complete tumor removal was performed in all patients. No 
procedure-related complications were encountered. Histopathology showed osteoid 
osteoma in 24 patients, osteoblastoma in 5 patients, and fibrous dysplasia, 
fibroadenoma and eosinophilic granuloma in one case each. All patients 
experienced significant pain relief after surgery, and had stopped pain 
medications by 12 months postoperatively. No patient suffered from tumor 
recurrence or spinal deformity. Conclusions: Minimally invasive surgery is 
feasible for total removal of selected benign vertebral tumors and may have some 
advantages over conventional surgical techniques."
1534,"Introduction: Cervical cancer is the fourth most prevalent malignancy and the 
fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in women around the world. 
Histologically, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common form of 
cervical cancer. SCC has several subtypes, and one of the rarest is papillary 
squamotransitional cell carcinoma (PSCC). In general, PSCC is believed to have a 
similar course and prognosis to typical SCC, with a high risk of late metastasis 
and recurrence. Case report: We discuss the case of a 45-year-old patient 
diagnosed with PSCC who was admitted to our department in December 2021. The 
clinical manifestations were pelvic discomfort and lymphadenopathy throughout 
the body. On admission, all laboratory values, with the exception of C-Reactive 
Protein (CRP) at 22.35 mg/L and hemoglobin (HGB) at 87.0 g/L, were normal. The 
clinical and ultrasound examination revealed a painful formation with indistinct 
borders in the right portion of the small pelvis. Following dilation and 
curettage, a Tru-Cut biopsy of the inguinal lymph nodes was performed. The 
investigation histologically indicated PSCC. MRI of the small pelvis showed an 
endophytic tumor in the cervix with dimensions of 35/26 mm and provided data for 
bilateral parametrial infiltration; a hetero-intensive tumor originating from 
the right ovary and involving small intestinal loops measuring 90/58 mm; and 
generalized lymphadenopathy and peritoneal metastases in the pouch of Douglass. 
The FIGO classification for the tumor was IVB. The patient was subsequently 
referred for chemotherapy by the tumor board's decision. Discussion: Despite the 
generally good prognosis of SCC, PSCC is a rare and aggressive subtype. It is 
usually diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a poor prognosis. Conclusions: 
PSCC is a rare subtype of SCC, and its diagnosis and treatment are challenging."
1535,"Background and Objectives: Recent findings demonstrate that the transmigration 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to the nervous 
system implicates severe neurotropic pathologies, including the onset of the 
rare disease called Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) which is characterized by 
immune-mediated polyneuropathy. This study aimed to identify the predisposing 
factors and the clinical features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced 
GBS. Materials and Methods: We have performed an analysis of 147 cases. A 
systematic review of the published research work was performed per the PRISMA 
statement to obtain individual participant data (IPD) for the meta-analysis. The 
search was conducted through PubMed, using the combined search terms 
""Guillain-Barré syndrome"" and ""COVID-19"". All case reports and series in the 
English language with accessed full text were included in the search. Results: A 
systematic database search led to the retrieval of 112 peer-reviewed articles 
published between 1 April 2020, and 8 February 2022. The articles comprised 16 
case series and 96 case reports containing IPD for 147 patients. Our findings 
showed that 77.6% of all cases were 40 years or older. Males comprised most of 
the cases (65.3%; n = 96). The intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 44.9%, 
and the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) was 38.1%. The patients presented 
with hyporeflexia or areflexia (84.4%; n = 124), lower limb strength and 
sensation impairment (93.2%; n = 138), upper limb strength and sensation 
impairment (85.7; n = 126), and somatic sensation impairment (72.8%; n = 107). 
The patients presented with increased cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) protein levels 
(92%; n = 92) and the presence of CSF albuminocytological dissociation (83.5%; n 
= 71). The most common variant of GBS observed was acute inflammatory 
demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). We found that predisposing factors 
concomitant with COVID-19 and GBS were male gender and older age. Among the 
cases, patient mortality was 10.9%. Conclusions: A gap of knowledge exists 
regarding the complete spectrum of clinical characteristics of COVID-19-related 
GBS. Recent findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 triggers GBS, as it follows a 
similar para-infectious pattern as the other viral agents contributing to the 
onset of GBS."
1536,"Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a hereditary cancer syndrome 
characterized by multiple café-au-lait macules on the skin. Lymphoproliferative 
malignancies associated with NF1 are limited, although the most common are brain 
tumors. Case presentation: A 22-year-old woman with NF1 was admitted due to 
abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Her laboratory data exhibited macrocytic 
anemia and elevated IgA levels. Image studies showed diffuse increased wall 
thickening in the transverse and descending colon without lymphadenopathy and 
hepatosplenomegaly. A colonoscopy revealed a hemorrhagic ulcerated mass. 
Pathological analysis of the tumor tissues confirmed IgA-expressing 
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma with histological 
transformation. Moreover, whole-exome sequencing in tumor tissues and peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells identified a somatic frameshift mutation of the A20 
gene, which represents the loss of function. The patient responded well to 
R-CHOP chemotherapy, but the disease relapsed after 1 year, resulting in a 
lethal outcome. Conclusions: MALT lymphoma in children and young adults is 
extremely rare and is possibly caused by acquired genetic changes. This case 
suggests a novel association between hereditary cancer syndrome and early-onset 
MALT lymphoma."
1537,"Management of early-stage cervical cancer (CC) in young women often faces 
challenges to preserve fertility, as well as to achieve an adequate oncological 
outcome. Although existing evidence supports a fertility-sparing treatment in 
the case of tumors &lt;2 cm in diameter, the approach is less clear in bulky 
early-stage CC. In addition, the outcomes of radical trachelectomy performed by 
minimally invasive techniques are also highly debatable. Highlighting the high 
incidences of young women with early-stage CC, the lack of sufficient data 
raises considerable hindrances towards the proper counseling of this vulnerable 
patient group. In this report, a case of a young woman with bulky early-stage CC 
with a strong desire to preserve fertility is presented. A satisfactory 
oncological outcome was achieved after neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by 
laparoscopic radical trachelectomy. Ongoing prospective trials are expected to 
provide stronger evidence on this topic."
1538,"Sensory ataxia due to posterior cord syndrome is a relevant, disabling condition 
in nontraumatic spinal cord dysfunction. Ataxic gait is a common symptom of 
sensory ataxia that restricts activities of daily living. A 70-year-old woman 
with severe sensory disturbance was diagnosed with intradural extramedullary 
spinal cord tumors found in the thoracic spine region (T8). Surgical management 
of the tumors was performed. The patient received gait training 20 days after 
surgery (postoperative acute phase) using a hybrid assistive limb (HAL). HAL is 
a wearable exoskeleton cyborg that provides real-time assistance to an 
individual for walking and limb movements through actuators mounted on the 
bilateral hip and knee joints. Walking ability was assessed using the 10 m 
walking test, which included evaluating walking speed, step length, and cadence 
in every session. To evaluate the immediate effects of HAL training, walking 
speed and step length were measured before and after the training in each 
session. During the 10 m walking test, gait kinematics and lower muscle activity 
were recorded using a motion capture system and wireless surface 
electromyography before the first session and after completion of all HAL 
sessions. After the HAL training sessions, improvement in the patient's gait 
performance was observed in the gait joint angles and muscle activity of the 
lower limb. After 10 training sessions, we observed the following changes from 
baseline: walking speed (from 0.16 m/s to 0.3 m/s), step length (from 0.19 m to 
0.37 m), and cadence (from 50.9 steps/min to 49.1 steps/min). The average 
standard deviations of the knee (from right, 7.31; left, 6.75; to right, 2.93; p 
&lt; 0.01, left, 2.63; p &lt; 0.01) and ankle joints (from right, 6.98; left, 
5.40; to right, 2.39; p &lt; 0.01, left, 2.18; p &lt; 0.01) were significantly 
decreased. Additionally, walking speed and step length improved immediately 
after completing all the HAL training sessions. This suggests that HAL gait 
training might be a suitable physical rehabilitation program for patients with 
sensory ataxia causing dysfunctional movement of the lower limb."
1539,"Background: Smartphones and wearable devices have become a part and parcel of 
the healthcare industry. The use of wearable technology has already proved its 
potentials in improving healthcare research, clinical work, and patient care. 
The real time data allows the care providers to monitor the patients' symptoms 
remotely, prioritize the patients' visits, assist in decision-making, and carry 
out advanced care planning. Objectives: The primary objective of our study was 
to investigate the potential use of wearable devices as a prognosis tool among 
patients in hospice care and palliative care, and the secondary objective was to 
examine the association between wearable devices and clinical data in the 
context of patient outcomes, such as discharge and deceased at various time 
intervals. Methods: We employed a prospective observational research approach to 
continuously monitor the hand movements of the selected 68 patients between 
December 2019 and June 2022 via an actigraphy device at hospice or palliative 
care ward of Taipei Medical University Hospital (TMUH) in Taiwan. Results: The 
results revealed that the patients with higher scores in the Karnofsky 
Performance Status (KPS), and Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) tended to live 
at discharge, while Palliative Prognostic Score (PaP) and Palliative prognostic 
Index (PPI) also shared the similar trend. In addition, the results also 
confirmed that all these evaluating tools only suggested rough rather than 
accurate and definite prediction. The outcomes (May be Discharge (MBD) or 
expired) were positively correlated with accumulated angle and spin values, 
i.e., the patients who survived had higher angle and spin values as compared to 
those who died/expired. Conclusion: The outcomes had higher correlation with 
angle value compared to spin and ACT. The correlation value increased within the 
first 48 h and then began to decline. We recommend rigorous prospective 
observational studies/randomized control trials with many participants for the 
investigations in the future."
1540,"Background and Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of bladder-prostatic muscle 
reconstruction and bladder neck eversion anastomosis in the recovery of urinary 
continence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Materials and 
Methods: From January 2020 to May 2022, 69 patients who underwent RARP in our 
hospital were recruited. Thirty-seven patients underwent RARP with the Veil of 
Aphrodite technique (control group). On the basis of the control group, 32 
patients underwent bladder-prostatic muscle reconstruction and bladder neck 
eversion anastomosis during RARP (observation group). The recovery of urinary 
continence was followed up at 24 h and 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after catheter 
removal. Results: There were no significant differences in operative time 
(127.76 ± 21.23 min vs. 118.85 ± 24.71 min), blood loss (118.27 ± 16.75 mL vs. 
110.77 ± 19.63 mL), rate of leakage (3.13% vs. 2.70%), rate of positive surgical 
margin (6.25% vs. 10.81%), or postoperative Gleason score [7 (6-8) vs. 7 (7-8)] 
between the observation group and the control group (p &gt; 0.05). After 
catheter removal, the rates of urinary continence at 24 h, 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 
weeks, and 24 weeks were 46.88%, 68.75%, 84.38%, 90.63%, and 93.75% in the 
observation group, respectively. Meanwhile, the rates of urinary continence in 
the control group were 21.62%, 37.84%, 62.16%, 86.49%, and 91.89%, respectively. 
There was a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.034), 
especially at 24 h, 1 week, and 4 weeks after catheter removal (p &lt; 0.05). 
Conclusions: Bladder-prostatic muscle reconstruction and bladder neck eversion 
anastomosis were beneficial to the recovery of urinary continence after RARP, 
especially early urinary continence."
1541,"The effectiveness of radical prostatectomy alone for locally advanced prostate 
cancer is controversial owing to an increased complication rate and 
treatment-related morbidity. With technical advances and refinements in surgical 
techniques, robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) has improved the 
outcomes of patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. RARP therefore plays 
a role in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer. In this study, we 
enrolled a total of 76 patients with pathologic stage pT3a, pT3b, pT4, or pN1. 
All patients were followed from surgery to June 2022, and their characteristics, 
perioperative outcomes, complications, adjuvant therapies and outcomes were 
analyzed. The median age of the patients was 69 years, and the initial PSA level 
was 20.5 (IQR 10.8-31.6) ng/mL. The median operative time was 205 (IQR 182-241) 
minutes. Sixty-six patients (86.8%) regained continence within 1 year, and the 
continence rate within 3 years of follow-up was 90.8% (69 patients). The overall 
survival rate was 100%. Twenty-two patients had BCR, of whom 13 received salvage 
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), 2 received salvage external beam radiation 
therapy (EBRT) alone, and 7 received combined ADT and EBRT. No patient had 
disease progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer during a median 36 
months of follow-up after salvage therapy. Our results suggest that RARP can 
also decrease tumor burden and allow for accurate and precise pathological 
staging with the need for subsequent treatment. Therefore, we recommend that 
RARP represents a well-standardized, safe, and oncologically effective option 
for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer."
1542,"Background: Reversion mutations in BRCA1/2, resulting in restoration of the open 
reading frame, have been identified as a mechanism of resistance to 
platinum-based chemotherapy or PARP inhibition. We sought to explore the 
incidence of BRCA1/2 reversion mutations in different tumor types. Methods: We 
retrospectively analyzed molecular profiling results from primary and/or 
metastatic tumor samples submitted by multiple institutions. The samples 
underwent DNA and RNA sequencing at a CLIA/CAP-certified clinical lab. Reversion 
mutations were called only in patients whose available clinical records showed 
the use of PARP inhibitors or platinum agents prior to tumor profiling. Results: 
Reversion mutations were identified in 75 of 247,926 samples profiled across all 
tumor types. Among patients carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic BRCA1/2 
mutations, reversion mutations in BRCA1/2 genes were seen in ovarian cancer (OC) 
(30/3424), breast cancer (BC) (27/1460), endometrial cancer (4/564), pancreatic 
cancer (2/340), cholangiocarcinoma (2/178), prostate cancer (5/461), cervical 
cancer (1/117), cancer of unknown primary (1/244), bladder cancer (1/300), 
malignant pleural mesothelioma (1/10), and a neuroendocrine tumor of the 
prostate. We identified 22 reversion mutations in BRCA1 and 8 in BRCA2 in OC. In 
BC, we detected 6 reversion mutations in BRCA1 and 21 in BRCA2. We compared 
molecular profile results of 14 high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) with 
reversion mutations against 87 control HGSOC with pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations 
without reversion mutations. Tumors with reversion mutations trended to have had 
lower ER expression (25% vs. 64%, p = 0.024, q = 0.82) and higher KDM6A mutation 
rate (15% vs. 0, p = 0.016, q = 0.82). Conclusions: We present one of the 
largest datasets reporting reversion mutations in BRCA1/2 genes across various 
tumor types. These reversion mutations were rare; this may be because some 
patients may not have had repeat profiling post-treatment. Repeat tumor 
profiling at times of treatment resistance can help inform therapy selection in 
the refractory disease setting."
1543,"Background and objectives: Among patients with pathologically proven T2N0 oral 
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a notable amount of patients still die from 
tumor recurrence although they have radical surgery for early stage cancers. In 
literature, the prognostic indicators of this specific disease entity were 
rarely reported. This study aims at analyzing the prognostic factors of T2N0 
OSCC patients and discussing possible managements to improve the survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2012 to December 2017, the data of 166 
pathologically proven T2N0 oral cancer patients proved by radical surgery were 
retrospectively collected. The clinical and pathologic factors including age, 
gender, tumor differentiation grade, perineural invasion (PNI), angiolymphatic 
invasion (ALI), margin status, and adjuvant therapy were analyzed by univariate 
and multivariate analysis to determine their association with disease-specific 
survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS), which were calculated by 
Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: After median follow up time of 43.5 months, overall 3-year rates of DSS 
and DFS were 86.1% and 80.1% respectively for our 166 patients. Univariate 
analysis showed that the 3-year DSS of 90.8% for PNI negative patients was 
significantly better than DSS of 57.0% for PNI positive patients (p = 0.0006). 
The 3-year DFS of 84.2% for PNI negative patients was also significantly better 
than DFS of 54.6% for PNI positive patients (p = 0.001). Further multivariate 
analysis revealed PNI was the only independent prognostic factor associated with 
both DSS (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 5.02; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.99-12.6; p 
= 0.001), and DFS (HR = 3.92; 95% CI = 1.65-9.32; p = 0.002). Nearly 10% (16) of 
the 166 patients had adverse pathologic feature of PNI only. In the 11 patients 
without adjuvant therapy, 5 patients died from OSCC. No patients had recurrence 
or mortality after they received adjuvant therapy with chemotherapy ± 
radiotherapy.
CONCLUSION: PNI was an independent prognostic factor for T2N0 oral cancer 
patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy may benefit the survival of 
this specific disease entity, but further investigations are needed to elucidate 
the optimal regimen."
1544,"Background and objectives: Combined peripheral neutrophil-platelet indexes 
reflecting the systemic inflammatory status have been reported to predict the 
clinical outcome in patients with various types of cancer. However, the 
prognostic value of combined neutrophil-platelet indexes in operable esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains unclear. The study introduced a novel 
combined neutrophil-meanplateletvolume-platelet ratio (NMPR) index and 
investigated its clinical and prognostic value in patients with operable ESCC 
receiving curative surgery. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 
the clinicopathologic data of 277 consecutive ESCC patients who received 
curative resection at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital in China between January 2007 and 
December 2010 was conducted (the training cohort). In addition, the 
clinicopathologic data of 101 resectable ESCC patients at Renmin Hospital of 
Hubei University of Medicine between December 2018 and June 2021 were collected 
(the external validation cohort). The optimal cutoff value of NMPR concerning 
overall survival (OS) in the training cohort was determined by X-tile software. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the 
prognostic value of NMPR along with other variables in the training cohort, 
which was further validated with the same cutoff value in the external 
validation cohort. Significant predictors of OS were used to construct the 
nomogram, of which the discrimination and calibration was evaluated by 
concordance index (C-index) and calibration plots. Results: With a cutoff value 
of 16.62, the results from both the training and external validation cohorts 
supported the association of high NMPR (&gt;16.62) with increased tumor length 
and advanced T stage but not with other variables. In the training cohort, a 
significant association between shorter OS and high NMPR (p = 0.04) as well as 
high CRP (p &lt; 0.001), poor tumor differentiation (p = 0.008), advanced T 
stage (p = 0.006), advanced N stage (p &lt; 0.001) and high CEA (p = 0.007) was 
revealed. Additionally, the high NMPR was verified to independently predict 
unfavorable OS (p = 0.049) in the external validation cohort. The C-index of the 
OS nomogram cooperating significant predictors in the training cohort was 0.71 
and the calibration plots of the OS nomogram fitted well. Conclusions: The 
present study demonstrates that high NMPR is an independent predictor of 
unfavorable OS in resectable ESCC patients without neoadjuvant therapy."
1545,"Esophageal submucosal tumors are rare, but their pathological types are diverse. 
In addition to the relatively common leiomyomas, some rare submucosal lesions 
are occasionally reported. Waldeyer's ring is described as a unique subtype of 
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, located in the naso-oropharynx. Studies have 
reported that Waldeyer's ring is the most common site of primary extranodal 
lymphoma in the head and neck. Interestingly, we encountered an esophageal 
submucosal tumor-like lesion similar to the tonsillar structures of Waldeyer's 
ring. A 38-year-old man underwent esophagoscopy after experiencing swallowing 
discomfort for 3 months. A protruding submucosal mass with slightly rough mucosa 
was found at the cervical esophagus approximately 20 cm from the incisors. 
Considering the possibility of the coexistence of a submucosal tumor and a 
mucosal lesion, as well as the continuous symptoms of swallowing discomfort, the 
patient underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection. The lesion was removed en 
bloc. However, histology revealed a lesion similar to the tonsillar structure of 
Waldeyer's ring between the lamina propria and submucosa. The patient was 
followed up for 6 months without recurrence or complaints. We report a new 
submucosal lesion and discuss its origin and treatment. Diagnostic ESD might be 
an effective option until its malignant potential is clarified."
1546,"Background and Objectives: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type 
of primary liver cancer, is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. It 
arises and progresses against fibrotic or cirrhotic backgrounds mainly due to 
infection with hepatitis viruses B (HBV) or C (HCV) or non-viral causes that 
lead to chronic inflammation and genomic changes. A better understanding of 
molecular and immune mechanisms in HCC subtypes is needed. Materials and 
Methods: To identify transcriptional changes in primary HCC tumors with or 
without hepatitis viral etiology, we analyzed the transcriptomes of 24 patients 
by next-generation sequencing. Results: We identified common and unique 
differentially expressed genes for each etiological tumor group and analyzed the 
expression of SLC, ATP binding cassette, cytochrome 450, cancer testis, and heat 
shock protein genes. Metascape functional enrichment analysis showed mainly 
upregulated cell-cycle pathways in HBV and HCV and upregulated cell response to 
stress in non-viral infection. GeneWalk analysis identified regulator, hub, and 
moonlighting genes and highlighted CCNB1, ACTN2, BRCA1, IGF1,&amp;nbsp;CDK1, 
AURKA, AURKB, and TOP2A in the HCV group and HSF1, HSPA1A, HSP90AA1, HSPB1, 
HSPA5, PTK2, and AURKB in the group without viral infection as hub genes. Immune 
infiltrate analysis showed that T cell, cytotoxic, and natural killer cell 
markers were significantly more highly expressed in HCV than in non-viral 
tumors. Genes associated with monocyte activation had the highest expression 
levels in HBV, while high expression of genes involved in primary adaptive 
immune response and complement receptor activity characterized tumors without 
viral infection. Conclusions: Our comprehensive study underlines the high degree 
of complexity of immune profiles in the analyzed groups, which adds to the 
heterogeneous HCC genomic landscape. The biomarkers identified in each HCC group 
might serve as therapeutic targets."
1547,"Background and objectives: Gastric cancer (GC) is often diagnosed in the 
metastatic stage. Palliative systemic therapy is still considered the gold 
standard, even for patients with resectable oligometastatic disease. The aim of 
the current study is to assess the potential benefit of up-front gastric and 
liver resection in patients with synchronous resectable liver-only metastases 
from GC (LMGC) in a Western population. Materials and Methods: All patients with 
GC and synchronous LMGC who underwent gastric resection with or without 
simultaneous resection of LMs between January 1997 and December 2016 were 
selected from the institutional records. Those with T4b primary tumors or with 
unresectable or more than three LMs were excluded from the analysis. All 
patients who underwent emergency surgery for hemorrhagic shock or gastric 
perforation were also excluded. Results: Out of 28 patients fulfilling the 
inclusion criteria, 16 underwent simultaneous gastric and liver resection (SR 
group), while 12 underwent palliative gastric resection (GR group). The median 
overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was of 18.81 months, with 1-, 3- and 
5-year OS rates of 71.4%, 17.9% and 14.3%, respectively. The 1-, 3- and 5-year 
OS rates in SR group (75%, 31.3% and 25%, respectively) were significantly 
higher than those achieved in GR group (66.7%, 0% and 0%, respectively; p = 
0.004). Multivariate analysis of the entire cohort revealed that the only 
independent prognostic factor associated with better OS was liver resection (HR 
= 3.954, 95% CI: 1.542-10.139; p = 0.004). Conclusions: In a Western cohort, 
simultaneous resection of GC and LMGC significantly improved OS compared to 
patients who underwent palliative gastric resection."
1548,"Background and Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 
randomized controlled trials was performed to compare the therapeutic effects 
and safety profiles of silodosin and tamsulosin for medical expulsive therapy 
(MET) of ureteral stones. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the 
Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to identify articles published before July 
2022 that described randomized controlled trials comparing silodosin and 
tamsulosin for MET of ureteral stones. Endpoints were stone expulsion rate, 
stone expulsion time, and total complication rate. Results: In total, 14 studies 
were included in our analysis. The size of ureteral stones was &lt;1 cm. 
Compared with tamsulosin, silodosin resulted in a significantly higher stone 
expulsion rate (p &lt; 0.01, odds ratio (OR) = 2.42, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) = 1.91 to 3.06, I2 = 0%) and significantly shorter stone expulsion time (p 
&lt; 0.01, mean difference = -3.04, 95% CI = -4.46 to -1.63, I2 = 89%). The 
total complication rate did not significantly differ between silodosin and 
tamsulosin (p = 0.33, OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.87 to 1.52, I2 = 7%). Conclusions: 
Compared with tamsulosin, silodosin resulted in significantly better expulsion 
of ureteral stones &lt;1 cm. The total complication rate did not significantly 
differ between silodosin and tamsulosin. Thus, silodosin may be superior to 
tamsulosin for MET of ureter stones &lt;1 cm."
1549,"Background and Objectives: Encouraging data have been reported from referral 
centers following gastrointestinal cancer surgery. Our goal was to 
retrospectively review patient outcomes following gastrectomy for gastric or 
gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer at a high-volume unit of the University 
of Athens. Methods: The enrollment period was from June 2003 to September 2018. 
Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to identify 
variables independently associated with time-to-event outcomes. Results: A total 
of 205 patients were analyzed. R0 resection was achieved in 183 (89.3%) patients 
and was more likely to occur following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.008). 
Recurrence developed in 46.6% of our cohort and the median disease-free survival 
was 31.2 months. On multivariate analysis, only staging (HR = 2.15; 95% CI: 
1.06-4.36) was independently associated with increased risk of recurrence. 
All-cause mortality was 57.2% and the median time of death was 40.9 months. On 
multivariate regression, staging (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.11-1.65) and recurrence 
(HR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.32-6.22) predicted inferior prognosis. Conclusions: 
Gastrectomy at the University of Athens has yielded favorable outcomes for 
patients with GEJ cancer."
1550,"Background and Objectives: The aim was to evaluate the association of 
inflammatory biomarkers with resectability and overall survival in hilar 
cholangiocarcinoma. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort 
study over 72 consecutive surgical cases of Klatskin tumor over an 11-year 
period. The sample was divided into two groups: 42 surgical resection cases and 
30 unresectable tumors. Values of inflammatory ratios were compared according to 
the resectability. Log-rank test, univariate, and multivariate Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to evaluate the overall survival. Results: Subjects 
were between 42-87 years old (average age of 64.91 ± 9.15 years). According to 
the procedure: 58.33% benefited from resection (with a 30.95% R0 resection rate) 
and 41.66% had palliative surgery. Elevated NLR (neutrophil to lymphocyte 
ratio), PLR (platelet to lymphocyte ratio), and SII (systemic 
immune-inflammation index), and lower LMR (lymphocyte to monocyte ratio) at 
admission were associated with unresectable tumors (p &lt; 0.01). For the 
multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, increased absolute values of NLR, 
PLR, and SII were associated with lower survival; no differences were observed 
for LMR absolute value. The cut-off value of NLR ≥ 6 was associated with lower 
survival. The median survival time for all subjects was 442 days, with 774 days 
for the resection group and 147 days for the group with palliative surgery. 
Conclusions: In hilar cholangiocarcinoma, inflammatory ratios are associated 
with tumor resectability. Tumor excision conferred an important advantage in 
survival. Elevated NLR, PLR, and SII values at admission significantly increased 
the hazard ratio. LMR had no influence on survival."
1551,"Background and Objectives: Cancer treatments can adversely influence body weight 
status, body composition, phase angle (PhA), and resting metabolic rate (RMR), 
which could possibly affect disease course. Τhe aim was to assess differences in 
body composition, PhA, RMR, and related parameters in non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) patients after treatment. Methods: The sample consisted of 82 NSCLC 
(stage IV) male patients (chemotherapy (C) 15.7%; immunotherapy (I) 13.3%; C + I 
25.3%; (C) + radiotherapy (R) 22.9 %; and other 15.5%). Body weight and body 
composition, PhA, RMR, oxygen consumption (VO2), ventilation rate, and diet were 
assessed at baseline and at 3 months after initiation of therapy. Results: 
Reductions in PhA, RMR, VO2, ventilation rate, and intracellular water were 
observed at follow up. Weight loss was evident for 45% of patients who also had 
a reduction in lean body mass. In the group under C, lean mass was reduced at 
follow up (55.3 ± 11.53 vs. 52.4 ± 12.6, p = 0.04) without significant weight 
changes. In subjects with a low adherence to the Mediterranean diet 
(MedDietScore &lt; 30), RMR (1940 ± 485 vs. 1730 ± 338 Kcal, p = 0.001), VO2 
(277.1 ± 70.2 vs. 247 ± 49.1 mL/min, p = 0.001), and ventilation rate (10.1 ± 
2.28 vs. 9. ± 2 2.2 L/min, p = 0.03) were significantly reduced. The changes in 
body weight were positively related to % of change in fat mass (rho = 0.322, p = 
0.003) and absolute lean mass change (rho = 0.534, p &lt; 0.001) and negatively 
associated with % of change in total body water (rho = -0.314, p = 0.004) 
(Spearman correlation coefficients). Conclusions: In conclusion, cancer therapy 
related to reductions in PhA and RMR, while lean mass reduction may be related 
to the type of treatment. Our results emphasize the importance of a more 
holistic nutritional and body composition assessment beyond body weight, to 
better address patients' needs in clinical practice."
1552,"Background and Objectives: ZBTB48 is a telomere-related protein that has been 
renamed telomeric zinc finger-associated protein (TZAP). It favorably binds to 
elongated telomeres to regulate their appropriate length. However, TZAP 
expression has not been investigated in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). 
Materials and Methods: The clinical significance of TZAP expression in 72 HCC 
was investigated. Additionally, its findings were supported by open big data and 
cancer cell lines. Results: TZAP expression level was not associated with the 
clinical parameters of HCC. TZAP expression induced a poorer survival result 
(overall survival, p = 0.020; disease-free survival, p = 0.012). TCGA data 
showed TZAP expression was more frequently found in HCCs with hepatitis C 
infection (p = 0.023). However, TCGA data revealed that TZAP expression did not 
predict HCC prognosis. In a cell line study, TZAP inhibition via siRNA 
suppressed PLC/PRF/5 cell growth; however, cell viability was increased in HepG2 
cells. Conclusions: We presented the clinical and prognostic values of TZAP 
expression in HCC tissues and cancer cell lines. Additionally, the TCGA results 
also revealed a significant role for TZAP expression. TZAP expression may 
involve HCC progression and its prognosis."
1553,"Background and Objectives: Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) are one of the earliest 
putative preneoplastic and, in some cases, neoplastic lesions in human colons. 
Many studies have confirmed the reduction of ACFs and colorectal adenomas after 
treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) commonly referred to as ASA; however, 
the minimum effective dose of ASA and the duration of use has not been fully 
elucidated. The objective of our study was to assess the significance of low 
dose ASA (75-mg internally once daily) to study the chemopreventive effect of 
ASA in ACF and adenomas development in patients taking this drug for a minimum 
period of 10 years. Materials and&amp;nbsp;Methods: Colonoscopy, combined with 
rectal mucosa staining with 0.25% methylene blue, was performed on 131 patients. 
The number of rectal ACF in the colon was divided into three groups: ACF &lt; 5; 
ACF 5-10; and ACF &gt; 10. Patients were divided into two groups: the ""With ASA"" 
group (the study group subjects taking ASA 75-mg daily for 10 years); and 
""Without ASA"" group (control group subjects not taking ASA chronically). The 
incidence of different types of rectal ACF and colorectal polyps in both groups 
of subjects was analysed and ascertained. Results: Normal ACF was found in 12.3% 
in the study group vs. 87.7% control group, hyperplastic 22.4% vs. 77.6%, 
dysplastic 25% vs. 75%, mixed 0% vs. 100%. Treatment with ASA affects the 
occurrence of colorectal adenomas. The amount of dysplastic ACFs was lower in 
the study group than in the control group. The increase in dysplastic ACFs 
decreases with age in both groups, with the increase greater in those not taking 
ASA. Conclusions: Patients who take persistent, chronic (&gt;10 years) low doses 
of ASA have a lower total number of all types of rectal ACFs and adenomas 
compared to the control group."
1554,"Background and Objectives: Body mass index (BMI) is widely used as a standard 
screening method for obesity and an indicator of related diseases. However, its 
inability to distinguish between lean body mass and body fat limits its utility. 
This limitation may be more prominent in older populations, wherein age-related 
sarcopenia and increased visceral fat due to the redistribution of adipose 
tissue may preclude a precise estimation of obesity. Many studies suggest that 
waist circumference (WC) is more strongly related to obesity-related diseases. 
There are also different opinions on whether the obesity paradox is real or a 
result of confusing interpretations. This study seeks to determine the 
association between myocardial infarction (MI), BMI, and WC in older adults and 
to determine if BMI and WC can reliably predict the risk of cardiovascular 
disease. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cohort study of older Korean 
adults aged over 75 years registered in the National Health Insurance System 
Senior database. Results: The results from the analysis using model 5, which was 
adjusted for each study variable, showed that the lower the BMI, the higher the 
hazard ratio (HR) of MI and vice versa. On the other hand, groups with lower 
than normal WC showed lower HR; even if it was higher, the difference was not 
statistically significant. Those with abdominal obesity tended to have an 
increased HR of MI. Conclusions: This study found that HR for MI has a negative 
relationship with BMI, whereas it has a positive relationship with WC. 
Furthermore, WC is a more appropriate indicator for predicting the risk of MI in 
the older population."
1555,"Background and Objectives: To clinically validate the computed tomography 
(CT)-based three-dimension (3D) model for treatment planning and intraoperative 
navigation of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) complicated with renal 
calculi. Materials and&amp;nbsp;Methods: We retrospectively collected the data 
of 26 patients with UPJO and renal calculi who were surgically treated in our 
institution from January 2019 to December 2021. Before surgery, 3D models based 
on preoperative CT scans were constructed in all patients. Additionally, the 
patients were divided into three groups according to the results of 3D models, 
distinguished by different treatment of renal calculi, that is, left untreated 
(1), pyelolithotomy (2), and endoscopic lithotomy (3). The quantitative analysis 
of renal calculi parameters, and perioperative and follow-up data were compared. 
Results: The mean number of involved renal calyces (p = 0.041), and the mean 
maximum cross-sectional area (p = 0.036) of renal stones were statistically 
different among the three groups. There were no significant differences among 
the three groups in the mean operative time, mean estimated blood loss, mean 
pararenal draining time, and mean hospital stay. The intraoperative stone 
clearance rates were 100% (11/11) and 77.8% (7/9) in group 2 and group 3, 
respectively. The trends of increased estimated glomerular filtration rate and 
decreased creatinine on the average levels after surgery were observed, although 
these changes were not statistically significant. At a mean follow-up of 19.4 ± 
6.4 months, the overall surgical success rate of the UPJO was 96.2% (25/26), and 
the overall success rate of renal calculi removal was 80.8% (21/26). Renal 
stones in 66.7% (4/6) of patients in group 1 spontaneously passed out. 
Conclusions: Preoperative 3D CT models have exact clinical value in the surgical 
planning and intraoperative navigation of UPJO patients complicated with renal 
calculi."
1556,"Background and objectives: Dermoscopy is a useful tool for the early and 
non-invasive diagnosis of skin malignancies. Besides many progresses, heavily 
pigmented and amelanotic skin tumors remain still a challenge. We aimed to 
investigate by dermoscopy if distinctive morphologic characteristics of vessels 
may help the diagnosis of equivocal nodular lesions. Materials and Methods: A 
collage of 16 challenging clinical and dermoscopic images of 8 amelanotic and 8 
heavily pigmented nodular melanomas and basal cell carcinomas was sent via 
e-mail to 8 expert dermoscopists. Results: Dermoscopy improved diagnostic 
accuracy in 40 cases. Vessels were considered the best clue in 71 cases. 
Focusing on the diameter of vessels improved diagnosis in 5 cases. Conclusions: 
vascular diameter in addition to morphology and arrangement may be a useful 
dermoscopic clue for the differential diagnosis of clinically equivocal nodular 
malignant tumors."
1557,"Background and Objectives: After liver transplantation (LT), long-term 
immunosuppression (IS) is essential. IS is associated with de novo malignancies, 
and the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increased in LT patients. We 
assessed course of disease in patients with de novo CRC after LT with focus of 
IS and impact on survival in a retrospective, single-center study. Materials 
and&amp;nbsp;Methods: All patients diagnosed with CRC after LT between 1988 and 
2019 were included. The management of IS regimen following diagnosis and the 
oncological treatment approach were analyzed: Kaplan-Meier analysis as well as 
univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. Results: A total of 33 out 
of 2744 patients were diagnosed with CRC after LT. Two groups were identified: 
patients with restrictive IS management undergoing dose reduction (RIM group, n 
= 20) and those with unaltered regimen (maintenance group, n = 13). The groups 
did not differ in clinical and oncological characteristics. Statistically 
significant improved survival was found in Kaplan-Meier analysis for patients in 
the RIM group with 83.46 (8.4-193.1) months in RIM and 24.8 (0.5-298.9) months 
in the maintenance group (log rank = 0.02) and showed a trend in multivariate 
cox regression (p = 0.054, HR = 14.3, CI = 0.96-213.67). Conclusions: 
Immunosuppressive therapy should be reduced further in patients suffering from 
CRC after LT in an individualized manner to enable optimal oncological therapy 
and enable improved survival."
1558,"Background and Objectives: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) is the standard 
surgical approach for adrenalectomy. At present, robotic adrenalectomy (RA) has 
been introduced at various hospitals. This study evaluated our initial 
experience with robotic adrenalectomy compared with conventional laparoscopic 
adrenalectomy. Materials and&amp;nbsp;Methods: From October 2018 to March 2022, 
56 adrenalectomies were performed by a single endocrine surgeon. Thirty-two 
patients underwent LA (LA group), and twenty-four patients underwent RA (RA 
group). Results: Patients in the RA group were significantly younger than those 
in the LA group (48.6 ± 9.7 years vs. 55.1 ± 11.4 years, p = 0.013). The RA 
group had a shorter operation time than the LA group (76.1 ± 28.2 min vs. 118.0 
± 54.3 min, p &lt; 0.001). The length of hospital stay and postoperative pain 
level between the two groups were similar. There were no complications in the RA 
group. There was no significant difference in the pathologic diagnosis between 
the two groups. The cost of surgery was significantly higher in the RA group 
than in the LA group (5288.5 US dollars vs. 441.5 ± 136.8 US dollars, p &lt; 
0.001). Conclusions: In our initial experience, RA showed a shorter operation 
time than LA and no complications. RA could be a viable alternative surgical 
option for adrenalectomy, notwithstanding its higher cost."
1559,"Background and Objectives: Survival estimation for patients diagnosed with 
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an important information to consider in patient management 
and communication. Despite some known risk factors, survival estimation remains 
a major challenge. Novel non-invasive technologies such as radiomics and 
artificial intelligence (AI) have been implemented to increase the accuracy of 
these predictions. In this article, we reviewed and discussed the most 
significant available research on survival estimation for GBM through advanced 
non-invasive methods. Materials and Methods: PubMed database was queried for 
articles reporting on survival prognosis for GBM through advanced image and data 
management methods. Articles including in their title or abstract the following 
terms were initially screened: ((glioma) AND (survival)) AND ((artificial 
intelligence) OR (radiomics)). Exclusively English full-text articles, reporting 
on humans, published as of 1 September 2022 were considered. Articles not 
reporting on overall survival, evaluating the effects of new therapies or 
including other tumors were excluded. Research with a radiomics-based 
methodology were evaluated using the radiomics quality score (RQS). Results: 382 
articles were identified. After applying the inclusion criteria, 46 articles 
remained for further analysis. These articles were thoroughly assessed, 
summarized and discussed. The results of the RQS revealed some of the 
limitations of current radiomics investigation on this field. Limitations of 
analyzed studies included data availability, patient selection and heterogeneity 
of methodologies. Future challenges on this field are increasing data 
availability, improving the general understanding of how AI handles data and 
establishing solid correlations between image features and tumor's biology. 
Conclusions: Radiomics and AI methods of data processing offer a new paradigm of 
possibilities to tackle the question of survival prognosis in GBM."
1560,"Background and Objectives: Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with 
chronic gastritis, ulcers, and gastric cancer. The H. pylori Type 4 secretion 
system (T4SS) translocates the CagA protein into host cells and plays an 
essential role in initiating gastric carcinogenesis. The CagL protein is a 
component of the T4SS. CagL amino acid polymorphisms are correlated with 
clinical outcomes. We aimed to study the association between CagL amino acid 
polymorphisms and peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD). 
Materials and Methods: A total of 99 patients (PUD, 46; NUD, 53) were enrolled 
and screened for H. pylori by qPCR from antrum biopsy samples. The amino acid 
polymorphisms of CagL were analyzed using DNA sequencing, followed by the MAFFT 
sequence alignment program to match the amino acid sequences. Results: Antrum 
biopsy samples from 70 out of 99 (70.7%) patients were found to be H. pylori 
DNA-positive. A positive band for cagL was detected in 42 out of 70 samples 
(PUD, 23; NUD, 19), and following this, these 42 samples were sequenced. In 
total, 27 different polymorphisms were determined. We determined three CagL 
amino acid polymorphism combinations, which were determined to be associated 
with PUD and NUD. Pattern 1 (K35/N122/V134/T175/R194/E210) was only detected in 
PUD patient samples and was related to a 1.35-fold risk (p = 0.02). Patterns 2 
(V41/I134) and 3 (V41/K122/A171/I174) were found only in NUD patient samples and 
were linked to a 1.26-fold increased risk (p = 0.03). Conclusions: We observed 
three new patterns associated with PUD and NUD. Pattern 1 is related to PUD, and 
the other two patterns (Patterns 2 and 3) are related to NUD. The patterns that 
we identified include the remote polymorphisms of the CagL protein, which is a 
new approach. These patterns may help to understand the course of H. pylori 
infection."
1561,"Background and Objectives: Uterine artery embolization (UAE) has become an 
accepted and widely performed therapy for patients with symptomatic (reporting 
at least two of the following symptoms: severe or prolonged menstrual bleeding, 
abdominal pain, tension in abdomen, problems with urination, constipation or 
anemia) uterine fibroids. Although in the majority of cases, bilateral occlusion 
is required to obtain a successful clinical outcome, there are patients in whom 
treatment of only one uterine artery could be attempted. There are several 
reasons for unilateral UAE: hemodynamic conditions, technical difficulties, 
anatomical variants and unilateral dominancy of blood supply to the fibroid. Our 
aim is to present our 10-year experience with unilateral UAE and evaluate the 
radiological and clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods: Records of 369 
patients with fibroids who underwent UAE from 2010 to 2021 were analyzed. We 
identified 26 patients treated with unilateral uterine artery embolization and 
analyzed the data of these patients. All patients attended medical consultation, 
were assessed using a five-grade symptom scale and underwent MRI examination. 
Clinical response was evaluated at least 6 months after the procedure and was 
categorized to one of the following groups: complete improvement, partial 
improvement, no change and a worsening in symptoms. Results: Twenty-two patients 
(85%) reported at least partial improvement 6 months following the procedure. 
One patient required secondary embolization due to recanalization. The secondary 
procedure was successful, and complete improvement was achieved. One patient did 
not observe any clinical improvement, and in two cases, symptom recurrence was 
observed. All three patients were referred for surgical treatment. No major 
complications were noted. Overall, the success rate was 88%. Conclusions: The 
results of our study support the statement that elective unilateral embolization 
is an appropriate treatment in patients with a dominant uterine artery."
1562,"Background and objectives: Facial weakness is the most important complication of 
parotid gland tumor surgery. The aims of this study are as follows: (1) 
assessment of the prevalence of postparotidectomy facial nerve dysfunction; (2) 
clinical and electrophysiological assessment of the facial nerve function before 
parotidectomy and at 1 and 6 months postoperatively; (3) assessment of the 
association of postoperative facial palsy with selected risk factors; and (4) 
assessment of the correlation between the results of clinical and 
neurophysiological assessments of facial nerve function. Materials and Methods: 
This study comprised 50 patients (aged 24-75 years) who underwent parotidectomy 
at the Department of Otolaryngology and Laryngological Oncology in Zabrze, 
Poland between 2015 and 2017. The evaluation included neurological, clinical and 
electrophysiological assessments of the facial nerve prior to surgery and at 1 
and 6 months postoperatively. Results: No facial palsy was found preoperatively 
or 6 months postoperatively. Facial nerve dysfunction was found in 74% of 
patients 1 month postoperatively. In most cases (54%), paresis was mild or 
moderate (House-Brackmann grades II and III). The results of 
electrophysiological tests before parotidectomy were either normal or showed 
some mild abnormalities. We found a statistically significant correlation 
between the clinical assessment of the facial nerve function (based on the 
House-Brackmann scale) one month postoperatively and the latency of the CMAP 
response from the orbicularis oculi and orbicularis oris muscles. In all three 
studies, a statistically significant correlation was found between the amplitude 
of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) of the orbicularis oris muscle 
and the degree of facial nerve weakness. Conclusions: The factors that may 
influence the risk of postoperative facial nerve paralysis (prolonged surgical 
time and the size and location of the tumor other than in the superficial lobe 
only) may indirectly suggest that surgery-related difficulties and/or surgeon 
experience could be crucial to surgery safety."
1563,"Background and Objectives: This study aims to describe the earliest renal 
lesions in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, especially the 
multicellular microscopic pathologic events, to get information into the genesis 
of renal neoplasms in this condition. Materials and Methods: Multicellular 
events were identified, and 3dimensional reconstruction was performed in grossly 
normal kidney parenchyma from VHL disease patients by using H&E-stained slides 
previously prepared. Results: The lesions were measured and the volume of 
clusters was calculated. Immunohistochemistry was performed for downstream 
HIF-target protein carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAIX) as well as CD34 for assessment of 
angiogenesis. We divided lesions into four types according to lesion 
height/size. The number of lesions was markedly decreased from lesion 1 
(smallest) to lesion 2, then from lesions 2 to 3, and again from lesion 3 to 4. 
Distribution was highly consistent in the four cases, and the same decrement 
pattern was seen in all blocks studied. The volumes of clusters were measured 
and divided into three categories according to their volume. The most frequent 
pathologic event in VHL kidneys was category 1 (smallest volume), then category 
2, and then category 3. Conclusion: We demonstrate that tracking histologic and 
morphologic changes in 3 dimensions of multicellular microscopic pathologic 
events enabled us to confirm a protracted sequence of events from smaller to 
larger cellular amplification events in VHL kidney."
1564,"Background and Objectives: Breast cancer (BC) molecular subtypes have unique 
incidence, survival and response to therapy. There are five BC subtypes 
described by immunohistochemistry: luminal A, luminal B HER2 positive and HER2 
negative, triple negative (TNBC) and HER2-enriched. Multiparametric breast MRI 
(magnetic resonance imaging) provides morphological and functional 
characteristics of breast tumours and is nowadays recommended in the 
preoperative setting. Aim: To evaluate the multiparametric MRI features (T2-WI, 
ADC values and DCE) of breast tumours along with breast density and background 
parenchymal enhancement (BPE) features among different BC molecular subtypes. 
Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study which included 344 
patients. All underwent multiparametric breast MRI (T2WI, ADC and DCE sequences) 
and features were extracted according to the latest BIRADS lexicon. The 
inter-reader agreement was assessed using the intraclass coefficient (ICC) 
between the ROI of ADC obtained from the two breast imagers (experienced and 
moderately experienced). Results: The study population was divided as follows: 
89 (26%) with luminal A, 39 (11.5%) luminal B HER2 positive, 168 (48.5%) luminal 
B HER2 negative, 41 (12%) triple negative (TNBC) and 7 (2%) with HER2 enriched. 
Luminal A tumours were associated with special histology type, smallest tumour 
size and persistent kinetic curve (all p-values &lt; 0.05). Luminal B HER2 
negative tumours were associated with lowest ADC value (0.77 × 10-3 mm2/s2), 
which predicts the BC molecular subtype with an accuracy of 0.583. TNBC were 
associated with asymmetric and moderate/marked BPE, round/oval masses with 
circumscribed margins and rim enhancement (all p-values &lt; 0.05). HER2 
enriched BC were associated with the largest tumour size (mean 37.28 mm, p-value 
= 0.02). Conclusions: BC molecular subtypes can be associated with T2WI, ADC and 
DCE MRI features. ADC can help predict the luminal B HER2 negative cases."
1565,"Agents of platinum-based chemotherapy, such as cisplatin or carboplatin, are 
used in the treatment of a wide range of malignancies that affect children, such 
as brain tumors, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, and germ cell 
tumors (GCTs). The Cyclophosphamide Equivalent Dose (CED) calculator for 
reproductive risk does not take platinum-based chemotherapy into account, 
despite the fact that it accounts for the majority of chemotherapy medications 
that are typically administered for pediatric GCTs. As a result, exposure to 
platinum-based drugs throughout infancy can have predictable long-term effects 
such as infertility, as well as other rare encounters such as lipoma formation 
and lipomatosis. Lipomas are the most prevalent benign soft tissue tumor 
subtype. They may be either solitary entities or engaged in multiple 
lipomatosis, which may have a familial origin or be an acquired disorder. 
Chemotherapy is a possible cause of lipomatosis. Chemotherapy based on cisplatin 
has been linked to a variety of long-term consequences, including kidney damage, 
neurotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity, and may even create secondary cancers. 
However, lipoma development is known to occur in fewer than 1 in 100 
individuals, and only a few examples of multiple cutaneous lipomatosis triggered 
by this therapy have been documented. Here we present a very rare case of 
lipomatosis in a pediatric patient with GCT under cisplatin therapy, which might 
be the third report of this kind affecting children."
1566,"Background and Objectives: We aimed to evaluate Progression Free Survival (PFS), 
Overall Survival (OS), and relapse rate in women affected by endometrioid 
ovarian cancer and synchronous endometrial-ovarian endometrioid cancer (SEO-EC). 
As secondary outcome, we assessed whether systematic pelvic and para-aortic 
lymphadenectomy could be considered a determinant of relapse rate in this 
population. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 
women with diagnosis of endometrioid ovarian cancer or SEO-EC between January 
2010 to September 2020, and calculated PFS, OS and relapse rate. Results: In 
almost all the patients (97.6%) who underwent systematic pelvic and para-aortic 
lymphadenectomy, there were no lymph node metastases confirmed by histology. We 
did not find a significant difference (p = 0.6570) for the rate of relapse in 
the group of women who underwent systematic pelvic and para-aortic 
lymphadenectomy (4/42; 9.5%) compared with the group of women who did not 
undergo the same procedure (1/21; 4.8%). During a median follow-up was 23 
months, both PFS and OS were excellent. Conclusions: Women affected by 
early-stage low-grade endometrioid cancer and SEO-EC without apparent lymph node 
involvement at pre-operative imaging showed a very low rate of lymph node 
metastasis and similar relapse rate with or without lymphadenectomy."
1567,"Background and Objectives: Treatment of cancer patients during the COVID-19 
pandemic has been a challenge worldwide. In accordance with the current 
recommendations for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) management during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, loco-regional therapy such as transarterial chemoembolization 
(TACE) was proposed with the purpose of achieving local tumor control and 
improving overall survival. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to 
evaluate the outcomes of TACE treatment in patients with HCC during the COVID-19 
pandemic in comparison with the outcomes of patients treated in the pre-pandemic 
period. Materials and Methods: Between September 2018 and December 2021, 154 
patients were managed by serial TACE procedures for different liver tumors. 
Ninety-seven patients met the study criteria and were divided into two groups: 
the study group n = 49 (patients treated from May 2020 to December 2021); the 
control group n = 48 (patients treated from September 2018 to May 2020). 
Results: The mean waiting time for TACE was significantly longer in the study 
group compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.001). No significant difference in 
survival between the groups is noted (log-rank test p = 0.823). In multivariate 
analysis, the MELD score (HR 1.329, 95% CI 1.140-1.548, p &lt; 0.001) remained a 
significant predictor of mortality. Conclusions: COVID-19 pandemic did not 
affect the final outcome of TACE treatment."
1568,"The treatment of bone cancer involves tumor resection followed by bone 
reconstruction of the defect caused by the tumor using biomaterials. 
Additionally, post-surgery protocols cover chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or drug 
administration, which are employed as adjuvant treatments to prevent tumor 
recurrence. In this work, we reviewed new strategies for bone cancer treatment 
based on bioactive glasses as carriers of cancer-targeted and other drugs that 
are intended for bone regeneration in conjunction with adjuvant treatments. 
Drugs used in combination with bioactive glasses can be classified into 
cancer-target, osteoclast-target, and new therapies (such as gene delivery and 
bioinorganic). Microparticulated, nanoparticulated, or mesoporous bioactive 
glasses have been used as drug-delivery systems. Additionally, surface 
modification through functionalization or the production of composites based on 
polymers and hydrogels has been employed to improve drug-release kinetics. 
Overall, although different drugs and drug delivery systems have been developed, 
there is still room for new studies involving kinase inhibitors or 
antibody-conjugated drugs, as these drugs have been poorly explored in 
combination with bioactive glasses."
1569,"Oily sludge is recognized as hazardous waste. To reduce the potential danger and 
harmful factors of oily sludge, it is very important to analyze its 
environmental risk. In this paper, the characterization of oily sludge from 
Shengli Oilfield in China was tested experimentally, including the composition 
content, particle size, microscopic morphology, heavy metal content, organic 
composition, inorganic composition, and thermogravimetric analysis, which were 
used to analyze environmental risks. The results show that the oil content of 
oily sludge is as high as 10.3%, which will cause serious pollution. It is 
calculated that China can recover 772.5 million liters of oil and reduce 553.9 
million kg of carbon emissions compared with incineration in one year, if the 
oily sludge can be managed effectively. The content of heavy metals such as Ba, 
Zn, Cr, As, Ni, Se, Be, and Hg in oily sludge exceeds the standard. It will 
restrain the self-healing ability of soil, pollute groundwater, and endanger 
animals and plants. The organic matter of oily sludge is concentrated in C11 to 
C29. It contains a large amount of benzene series and polycyclic benzene 
hydrocarbons, which can lead to cancer in the human body. Inorganic substances 
in oily sludge are mixed with some additives, which can not only reduce the 
toxicity of heavy metals, but also be used as building materials. The median 
particle size D50 of oily sludge is 0.91 μm, and it spreads all over the narrow 
pores. Generally, it needs to be treated under high temperature conditions, 
which will cause secondary pollution to the environment. The research content of 
this paper provides a theoretical reference for the management of oily sludge."
1570,"Microneedles are highly sought after for medicinal and cosmetic applications. 
However, the current manufacturing process for microneedles remains complicated, 
hindering its applicability to a broader variety of applications. As diffraction 
lithography has been recently reported as a simple method for fabricating solid 
microneedles, this paper presents the experimental validation of the use of 
ultraviolet light diffraction to control the liquid-to-solid transition of 
photosensitive resin to define the microneedle shape. The shapes of the 
resultant microneedles were investigated utilizing the primary experimental 
parameters including the photopattern size, ultraviolet light intensity, and the 
exposure time. Our fabrication results indicated that the fabricated 
microneedles became taller and larger in general when the experimental 
parameters were increased. Additionally, our investigation revealed four unique 
crosslinked resin morphologies during the first growth of the microneedle: 
microlens, first harmonic, first bell-tip, and second harmonic shapes. 
Additionally, by tilting the light exposure direction, a novel inclined 
microneedle array was fabricated for the first time. The fabricated microneedles 
were characterized with skin insertion and force-displacement tests. This 
experimental study enables the shapes and mechanical properties of the 
microneedles to be predicted in advance for mass production and wide practical 
use for biomedical or cosmetic applications."
1571,"A nanocomposite composed of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and core-shell 
nanoparticles of Fe3O4@SiO2 was prepared as a pH-responsive nanocarrier for 
quercetin (QC) delivery. The nanoparticles were further entrapped in a 
water-in-oil-in-water emulsion system for a sustained release profile. The 
CMC/Fe3O4@SiO2/QC nanoparticles were characterized using dynamic light 
scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray 
diffraction (XRD), a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), and a 
vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) to obtain insights into their size, 
stability, functional groups/chemical bonds, crystalline structure, morphology, 
and magnetic properties, respectively. The entrapment and loading efficiency 
were slightly improved after the incorporation of Fe3O4@SiO2 NPs within the 
hydrogel network. The dialysis method was applied for drug release studies. It 
was found that the amount of QC released increased with the decrease in pH from 
7.4 to 5.4, while the sustained-release pattern was preserved. The A549 cell 
line was chosen to assess the anticancer activity of the CMC/Fe3O4@SiO2/QC 
nanoemulsion and its components for lung cancer treatment via an MTT assay. The 
L929 cell line was used in the MTT assay to determine the possible side effects 
of the nanoemulsion. Moreover, a flow cytometry test was performed to measure 
the level of apoptosis and necrosis. Based on the obtained results, 
CMC/Fe3O4@SiO2 can be regarded as a novel promising system for cancer therapy."
1572,"INTRODUCTION: The risk of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) in mega-prosthesis 
for malignancy is increased compared with non-tumor cases. While several studies 
describe PJI in tumor-related arthroplasty, prospective studies comparing 
infection characteristics among different joints are limited. The present study 
analyzes mega-arthroplasty for hip, knee, and shoulder malignancy and compares 
the epidemiology, diagnosis, microbe spectrum, treatments, and outcomes between 
the different entities.
METHODS: The retrospective inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) 
mega-arthroplasty (2) in the hip, knee, or shoulder joint and a total femur 
arthroplasty (3) following a malignant bone tumor or metastasis (4) between 1996 
and 2019. All included patients were prospectively followed and invited for a 
renewed hospital examination, and their PJI characteristics (if identified) were 
analyzed using both retrospective as well as newly gained prospective data. A 
PJI was defined according to the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) 
and re-infection was defined according to the modified Delphi Consensus 
criteria.
RESULTS: In total, 83 cases of tumor mega-arthroplasty at a mean follow-up of 
3.9 years could be included (32 knee, 30 hip, and 19 shoulder cases and 2 cases 
of total femur arthroplasty). In total, 14 PJIs were identified, with 
chondrosarcoma in 6 and osteosarcoma in 3 being the leading tumor entities. Knee 
arthroplasty demonstrated a significantly higher rate of PJI (p = 0.027) 
compared with hips (28.1% vs. 6.7%), while no significant difference could be 
found between the knee and shoulder (10.5%) (p = 0.134) or among shoulder and 
hip cases (p = 0.631). The average time of PJI following primary implantation 
was 141.4 months in knee patients, 64.6 in hip patients, and 8.2 months in 
shoulder patients. Age at the time of the primary PJI, as well as the time of 
the first PJI, did not show significant differences among the groups. Thirteen 
of the fourteen patients with PJI had a primary bone tumor. Statistical analysis 
showed a significant difference in the disadvantage of primary bone tumors (p = 
0.11). While the overall cancer-related mortality in the knee PJI group (10%) 
was low, it was 50% in the hip and 100% in the shoulder group.
CONCLUSION: The risk of PJI in knee tumor arthroplasty is significantly 
increased compared with hips, while cancer-related mortality is significantly 
higher in hip PJI cases. At the same time, mega-prostheses appear to be 
associated with a higher risk of infection due to a primary bone tumor compared 
with metastases. The study confirms existing knowledge concerning PJI in tumor 
arthroplasty, while, being one of the few studies to compare three different 
joints concerning PJI characteristics."
1573,"Liver cancer represents a global health challenge with worldwide growth. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer. Indeed, 
approximately 90% of HCC cases have a low survival rate. Moreover, 
cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is another malignant solid tumor originating from 
cholangiocytes, the epithelial cells of the biliary system. It is the 
second-most common primary liver tumor, with an increasing course in morbidity 
and mortality. Tumor cells always show high metabolic levels, antioxidant 
modifications, and an increased iron uptake to maintain unlimited growth. In 
recent years, alterations in iron metabolism have been shown to play an 
important role in the pathogenesis of HCC. Several findings show that a diet 
rich in iron can enhance HCC risk. Hence, elevated iron concentration inside the 
cell may promote the development of HCC. Growing evidence sustains that 
activating ferroptosis may potentially block the proliferation of HCC cells. 
Even in CC, it has been shown that ferroptosis plays a crucial role in the 
treatment of tumors. Several data confirmed the inhibitory effect in cell growth 
of photodynamic therapy (PDT) that can induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 
CC, leading to an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and a decrease in 
intracellular glutathione (GSH). MDA and GSH depletion/modulation are crucial in 
inducing ferroptosis, suggesting that PDT may have the potential to induce this 
kind of cell death through these ways. A selective induction of programmed cell 
death in cancer cells is one of the main treatments for malignant tumors; thus, 
ferroptosis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy against HCC and CC."
1574,"The reprogramming of lipid metabolism has been highlighted in colorectal cancer 
(CRC) studies, suggesting a critical role for the scavenger receptor CD36 and 
fatty acid synthase (FASN) in this malignancy. In this study, we analyzed the 
gene expression levels of CD36, FASN, the cell surface glypican 4 (GPC4), and 
the two transporters SLC27A3 and SLC27A4 in 39 paired tumoral and peritumoral 
tissues from patients with CRC compared with 18 normal colonic mucosae. 
Moreover, the levels of seven miRNAs targeting CD36 and most of the analyzed 
genes were evaluated. We found a significant impairment of the expression of all 
the analyzed genes except GPC4 as well as the differential expression of 
miR-16-5p, miR-26b-5p, miR-107, miR-195-5p, and miR-27a-3p in the colonic mucosa 
of CRC patients. Interestingly, CD36 and miR-27a-3p were downregulated and 
upregulated, respectively, in tumoral tissues compared to peritumoral and 
control tissues, with a significant negative correlation in the group of 
patients developing lymph node metastasis. Our results sustain the relationship 
between CRC and fatty acid metabolism and emphasize the importance of related 
miRNAs in developing new therapeutic strategies."
1575,"In the present study, the anti-proliferative and apoptotic potential of Tabebuia 
roseo-alba in lung cancer was assessed. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) of T. 
roseo-alba were synthesized using an ethanolic extract and characterized by 
adopting various parameters. Herein, the eco-friendly, cost-effective, and green 
synthesis of AgNPs was evaluated using an ethanolic extract of T. roseo-alba. 
The as-synthesized AgNPs were then characterized using various characterization 
techniques, such as UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray powder diffraction 
(XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The AgNPs are crystalline, spherical, 
and highly stable AgNPs of varying sizes in the range of 5-20 nm. The anticancer 
activity of the ethanolic extract of T. roseo-alba and its AgNPs was determined 
using an MTT assay. The results indicated that, although both samples showed 
prominent anti-proliferative activity on lung cancer cell lines, the AgNPs of T. 
roseo-alba were found to be more potent than the ethanolic extract. Further, 
apoptosis induction ability was evaluated by FITC Annexin V and PI staining, the 
results of which demonstrated the efficiency of the ethanolic extract of T. 
roseo-alba and its AgNPs in causing oxidative stress and subsequent cellular 
death. This was subsequently further confirmed by measuring the mitochondrial 
membrane potential after staining the cells with JC1. The apoptotic mode of cell 
death was further confirmed by DNA fragmentation and caspase assays using 
Western blot analysis."
1576,"This work aims to prepare pure Chlorin e6 (Ce6) and establish Ce6-mediated 
photodynamic therapy (Ce6-PDT) as a better therapy option for canine tumors as 
well as mouse tumor models. Five dogs suffering from various cancers were 
treated with Ce6-PDT from one to several times. After receiving the Ce6 (2.5 
mg/kg) for 3 h, tumors were illuminated superficially or interstitially with 660 
nm light. Two dogs underwent Ce6-guided fluorescence imaging by photodynamic 
diagnosis (PDD). Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by the 
4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and 
western blot assay, respectively. Ce6-PDT efficacy was also determined using 
melanoma and pancreatic cancer mouse models. Two veterinary patients with 
mammary carcinoma and histiocytic sarcoma had their tumors significantly 
diminished and showed improved health after receiving Ce6-PDT. Moreover, in the 
cases of canine tumors, the adjunctive use of Ce6-PDD revealed cancers that were 
not visible with white light viewing and provided a visual contrast from 
surrounding tissues. Also, in vivo, Ce6-PDT remarkably reduced melanoma and 
pancreatic tumors in the mouse model. These findings could pave the way for a 
better understanding of the underlying processes of Ce6-PDT, making it an 
effective and safe candidate for use in human and veterinary applications to 
abolish various cancers."
1577,"Lung cancer, of which non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents about 80% of 
all cases, is the second most common cancer diagnosed in the general population 
and one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Overall, the 
outcomes of patients with advanced NSCLC are still disappointing despite 
advances in diagnosis and treatment. In recent years immune-checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs), administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy, have 
revolutionized the treatment landscape of patients with advanced non-small-cell 
lung cancer. However, until now, tissue expression of PD-L1 and tumor mutation 
burden represent the only available biomarkers for NSCLC patients treated with 
ICIs. A growing body of evidence showed that tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) have 
the PD-L1 protein on their surface and that they are involved in angiogenesis, 
tumor growth, invasion, metastasis and immune escape. This review focused on the 
potential clinical applications of TDEs in NSCLC, including their possible role 
as a biomarker for prognosis and disease monitoring in patients undergoing 
immunotherapy."
1578,"Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common pediatric malignant bone tumor. Although 
surgery together with neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy has improved survival 
for localized OSA, most patients develop recurrent/metastatic disease with a 
dismally poor outcome. Therapeutic options have not improved for these OSA 
patients in recent decades. As OSA is a rare and ""orphan"" tumor, with no 
distinct targetable driver antigens, the development of new efficient therapies 
is still an unmet and challenging clinical need. Appropriate animal models are 
therefore critical for advancement in the field. Despite the undoubted relevance 
of pre-clinical mouse models in cancer research, they present some intrinsic 
limitations that may be responsible for the low translational success of novel 
therapies from the pre-clinical setting to the clinic. From this context emerges 
the concept of comparative oncology, which has spurred the study of pet dogs as 
a uniquely valuable model of spontaneous OSA that develops in an 
immune-competent system with high biological and clinical similarities to 
corresponding human tumors, including in its metastatic behavior and resistance 
to conventional therapies. For these reasons, the translational power of studies 
conducted on OSA-bearing dogs has seen increasing recognition. The most recent 
and relevant veterinary investigations of novel combinatorial approaches, with a 
focus on immune-based strategies, that can most likely benefit both canine and 
human OSA patients have been summarized in this commentary."
1579,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infects about half of the world's population and 
can lead to premalignant lesions and gastric cancer. Updated data about the 
correlation of histopathological diagnostics with endoscopic diagnostics are 
scarce. The objective of this study was to identify the concordance between 
endoscopic and histopathologic findings, with a focus on premalignant lesions. 
We performed a cross sectional, retrospective study over a 4-year period 
(2017-2021) on adult patients with dyspeptic symptoms and positive RUT (rapid 
urease test) in a single hospital centre, with a total of 133 patients infected 
with H. pylori being included in the study. Statistical associations between 
endoscopic appearance and histopathological results were found for atrophic 
antral gastritis (p = 0.001), intestinal metaplasia of the antrum (p = 0.018), 
gastric polyps (p &lt; 0.001) and gastric corpus cancer (p = 0.012). Females 
were more likely to be diagnosed through endoscopy with gastric atrophy or 
intestinal metaplasia (p = 0.031), while chronic atrophic gastritis in corpus 
was more prevalent in patients older than 65 (p = 0.024). Overall, our study 
reveals only 21% concordance between Giemsa stain and RUT, highlighting the 
importance of combining rapid testing with endoscopic and histopathological 
diagnostic methods for a more accurate early diagnosis and prevention of gastric 
cancer."
1580,"Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) has been implicated in the development of several types 
of cancer, including lung malignancy. In the present study, we examined the 
impact of Ang-2 serum concentration on the development, dissemination, and 
5-year overall survival of NSCLC and SCLC. A total of 99 patients with lung 
cancer were tested. The OS of NSCLC and SCLC patients was estimated using 
Kaplan-Meier curves and compared through log-rank test. The median serum level 
of Ang-2 at baseline in both NSCLC and SCLC patients was significantly higher 
than that of controls (p &lt; 0.0001). The Ang-2 serum concentration was not 
related to metastasis, neither in NSCLC nor in SCLC cases. The OS was found to 
be significantly shorter for stage IIIβ NSCLC patients with a high baseline 
Ang-2 serum concentration (p = 0.012), while Cox regression analysis showed that 
Ang-2 is a significant independent factor for poor prognosis for stage IIIβ 
NSCLC (hazard ratio = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.05-8.40, p = 0.04). The concentration of 
Ang-2 has no impact on the prognosis of SCLC. Ang-2 could be considered as a 
significant molecular marker that enables the prediction of NSCLC and SCLC 
development, and is involved in the poor prognosis of stage IIIβ NSCLC."
1581,"Proper delineation of both target volumes and organs at risk is a crucial step 
in the radiation therapy workflow. This process is normally carried out manually 
by medical doctors, hence demanding timewise. To improve efficiency, 
auto-contouring methods have been proposed. We assessed a specific commercial 
software to investigate its impact on the radiotherapy workflow on four specific 
disease sites: head and neck, prostate, breast, and rectum. For the present 
study, we used a commercial deep learning-based auto-segmentation software, 
namely Limbus Contour (LC), Version 1.5.0 (Limbus AI Inc., Regina, SK, Canada). 
The software uses deep convolutional neural network models based on a U-net 
architecture, specific for each structure. Manual and automatic segmentation 
were compared on disease-specific organs at risk. Contouring time, geometrical 
performance (volume variation, Dice Similarity Coefficient-DSC, and center of 
mass shift), and dosimetric impact (DVH differences) were evaluated. With 
respect to time savings, the maximum advantage was seen in the setting of head 
and neck cancer with a 65%-time reduction. The average DSC was 0.72. The best 
agreement was found for lungs. Good results were highlighted for bladder, heart, 
and femoral heads. The most relevant dosimetric difference was in the rectal 
cancer case, where the mean volume covered by the 45 Gy isodose was 10.4 cm3 for 
manual contouring and 289.4 cm3 for automatic segmentation. Automatic contouring 
was able to significantly reduce the time required in the procedure, simplifying 
the workflow, and reducing interobserver variability. Its implementation was 
able to improve the radiation therapy workflow in our department."
1582,"Transepidermal water-loss (TEWL), stratum-corneum hydration (SCH), erythema, 
elasticity, pH and melanin, are parameters of the epidermal barrier function and 
skin homeostasis that objectively indicate the integrity of the skin barrier. 
Sunscreens are necessary to protect people from skin cancer, but could modify 
the skin barrier function. Nevertheless, there are not many studies on their 
impact on skin homeostasis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of 
sunscreens on the epidermal-barrier function and skin homeostasis of healthy 
individuals. A prospective observational study was designed. TEWL, SCH, 
erythema, elasticity, pH and melanin were measured on the cheek and volar region 
of the forearm, using non-invasive methods before and after applying sunscreen. 
Four different sunscreens were tested, one full-body sunscreen and three facial 
sunscreens. The study included 51 healthy volunteers, 72.5% (37/51) women, with 
a mean age of 41.63 years. After full-body sunscreen application, temperature 
increased by 0.68 °C (p &lt; 0.001), pH by 0.16 units (p &lt; 0.001), and 
elasticity by 0.22% (p = 0.039), while melanin decreased by 10.95 AU (p &lt; 
0.001), erythema by 28.79 AU (p &lt; 0.001) and TEWL by 0.66 g·m-2·h-1 (p = 
0.019). On the cheek, facial sunscreen 1 increased temperature by 0.51 °C, TEWL 
0.7 g·m-2·h-1 (p &lt; 0.05), pH by 0.12 units (p &lt; 0.001) and elasticity by 
0.059% (p &lt; 0.001), but decreased erythema by 19.87 AU (p &lt; 0.05) and SCH 
by 5.63 AU (p &lt; 0.001). Facial sunscreen 2 increased temperature by 0.67 °C, 
TEWL by 1.93 g·m-2·h-1 (p &lt; 0.001), pH by 0.42 units (p &lt; 0.001) and 
elasticity by 0.12% (p &lt; 0.01), but decreased melanin by 15.2 AU (p = 0.000), 
erythema by 38.61 AU (p &lt; 0.05) and SCH by 10.80 AU (p &lt; 0.01). Facial 
sunscreen 3 increased temperature by 1.15 °C, TEWL by 2.29 g·m-2·h-1 (p &lt; 
0.001), pH by 0.46 units (p &lt; 0.001) and elasticity by 0.15% (p &lt; 0.01), 
but decreased erythema by 35.7 (p &lt; 0.05) and SCH by 10.80 AU (p &lt; 0.01). 
In conclusion, sunscreen could slightly modify the skin-barrier function. All of 
them decreased erythema, likely in relation to anti-inflammatory power."
1583,"With an incidence of over 1.5 million worldwide per annum, breast cancer 
continues to be the most common cancer affecting the female population. The main 
and most effective treatment in over 40% of these patients is a primary neoplasm 
resection. General anaesthesia, at times in association with loco-regional 
anaesthetics, is the most commonly used anaesthesia technique for radical 
mastectomies. Nausea, vomiting, and considerable postoperative pain, which are 
commonly experienced side effects and complications of general anaesthesia, 
tend, however, to augment most patients' post-surgical morbidity. A growing body 
of research has shown that loco-regional anaesthesia often used together with 
and, in some cases, in the substitution of general anaesthesia can be a safe, 
effective alternative. This work is a case report regarding a 94-year-old 
elderly patient who was anaesthetised during a left radical mastectomy using 
exclusively combined interpectoral and pectoserratus plane blocks."
1584,"Particle therapy is a developing area of radiotherapy, mostly involving the use 
of protons, neutrons and carbon ions for cancer treatment. The reduction of side 
effects on healthy tissues in the peritumoral area is an important advantage of 
particle therapy. In this review, we analyze state-of-the-art particle therapy, 
as compared to conventional photon therapy, to identify clinical benefits and 
specify the mechanisms of action on tumor cells. Systematization of published 
data on particle therapy confirms its successful application in a wide range of 
cancers and reveals a variety of biological effects which manifest at the 
molecular level and produce the particle therapy-specific molecular signatures. 
Given the rapid progress in the field, the use of particle therapy holds great 
promise for the near future."
1585,"The SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies response is the best indicator of 
effective protection after infection and/or vaccination, but its evaluation 
requires tedious cell-based experiments using an infectious virus. We analyzed, 
in 105 patients with various histories of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or 
vaccination, the neutralizing response using a virus neutralization test (VNT) 
against B.1, Alpha, Beta and Omicron variants, and compared the results with two 
surrogate assays based on antibody-mediated blockage of the ACE2-RBD interaction 
(Lateral Flow Boditech and ELISA Genscript). The strongest response was observed 
for recovered COVID-19 patients receiving one vaccine dose. Naïve patients 
receiving 2 doses of mRNA vaccine also demonstrate high neutralization titers 
against B.1, Alpha and Beta variants, but only 34.3% displayed a neutralization 
activity against the Omicron variant. On the other hand, non-infected patients 
with half vaccination schedules displayed a weak and inconstant activity against 
all isolates. Non-vaccinated COVID-19 patients kept a neutralizing activity 
against B.1 and Alpha up to 12 months after recovery but a decreased activity 
against Beta and Omicron. Both surrogate assays displayed a good correlation 
with the VNT. However, an adaptation of the cut-off positivity was necessary, 
especially for the most resistant Beta and Omicron variants. We validated two 
simple and reliable surrogate neutralization assays, which may favorably replace 
cell-based methods, allowing functional analysis on a larger scale."
1586,"(1) Background: Nowadays, obesity is well-recognised as a significant risk 
factor for many chronic diseases, for example, hypertension, diabetes, 
atherosclerosis and cancer. This study is designed to investigate the prognostic 
value of the pre- and post-treatment serum levels of adiponectin and leptin in 
luminal A and B invasive breast cancer (IBrC) patients based on six-years 
follow-up. (2) Methods: Among 70 patients who underwent breast surgery, 35 were 
Stage I and 35 were Stage II. The concentrations of pre- and post-treatment 
adiponectin and leptin were evaluated with a specific ELISA kit. The median 
follow-up was 68.5 months (inter-quartile range (IQR) = 59-72 months) with a 
recurrence rate of 15.71%. (3) Results: Generally, concentrations of leptin and 
adiponectin increased after adjuvant therapy. Follow-up showed a significantly 
higher incidence of disease relapse in IBrC patients with a high post-treatment 
concentration of leptin (25.71% vs. 5.71% of cases with a low post-treatment 
concentration of leptin). A post-treatment leptin concentration of 26.88 ng/mL 
with a specificity of 64.9% and a sensitivity of 88.9% was determined as the 
best cut-off value to distinguish patients with disease recurrence from those 
without disease relapse. (4) Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that only the 
post-treatment serum leptin concentration may be of value as a prognostic 
indicator and could contribute to predicting a future outcome for patients with 
early-stage IBrC."
1587,"Berry volatiles are responsible for the berry aroma but there is limited 
information available on the health-promoting activities of berry volatiles. The 
objectives of this study were to evaluate the chemical composition of volatile 
extracts from black raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries and investigate 
their antiproliferative effect and apoptotic mechanisms on A549 lung cancer 
cells. The chemical composition of three berry volatile extracts (BVEs) was 
identified by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cells were treated 
with different dilutions of three BVEs for 48 h and determined for cell 
proliferation and apoptosis. Total volatiles in BVEs were 1.6-3.2 mg/L. Two-fold 
diluted BVEs significantly inhibited cell proliferation after 48 h, inducing 
apoptosis (p &lt; 0.05). Blackberry volatile extract significantly reduced the 
inactive form of apoptotic proteins, including poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose 
polymerase (PARP), procaspase-9, and procaspase-3 compared to the control (p 
&lt; 0.05). Blueberry volatile extract showed higher apoptotic cell death (p 
&lt; 0.05) with a slightly higher cell population in G0/G1 phase than other 
berries. These results showed that volatile extracts from three berries have the 
antiproliferative effect on human lung adenocarcinoma cells partially via 
apoptosis, suggesting that volatiles from three berries may have potential 
anti-cancer activity through apoptosis in lung cancer."
1588,"BACKGROUND: In addition to their great optical properties, nanodiamonds (NDs) 
have recently proved useful for two-photon-excited photodynamic therapy 
(TPE-PDT) applications. Indeed, they are able to produce reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) directly upon two-photon excitation but not with one-photon excitation; 
Methods: Fluorescent NDs (FNDs) with a 100 nm diameter and detonation NDs (DNDs) 
of 30 nm were compared. In order to use the gems for cancer-cell theranostics, 
they were encapsulated in a bis(triethoxysilyl)ethylene-based (ENE) periodic 
mesoporous organosilica (PMO) shell, and the surface of the formed nanoparticles 
(NPs) was modified by the direct grafting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and amino 
groups using PEG-hexyltriethoxysilane and aminoundecyltriethoxysilane during the 
sol-gel process. The NPs' phototoxicity and interaction with MDA-MB-231 breast 
cancer cells were evaluated afterwards; Results: Transmission electronic 
microscopy images showed the formation of core-shell NPs. Infrared spectra and 
zeta-potential measurements confirmed the grafting of PEG and NH2 groups. The 
encapsulation of the NDs allowed for the imaging of cancer cells with NDs and 
for the performance of TPE-PDT of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells with significant 
mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Multifunctional ND@PMO core-shell nanosystems were successfully 
prepared. The NPs demonstrated high biocompatibility and TPE-PDT efficiency in 
vitro in the cancer cell model. Such systems hold good potential for 
two-photon-excited PDT applications."
1589,"Our study aimed to identify pathways from the source of information to the 
uptake of cancer genetic testing, with consideration of intermediate variables 
including perceptional, attitudinal and psychosocial factors. We used the Health 
Information National Trends Survey (2020 database) and constructed a structural 
equation model for pathway analysis (using SPSS version 24). Variables for 
socio-demographic, lifestyle and health information were also collected and used 
for confounding adjustment. A total of 2941 participants were analyzed (68.5%, 
non-Hispanic white; 59.7%, females; 58 years, median age; and 142 (4.8%) had 
undertaken genetic testing for cancer risk previously). Our pathway analysis 
found that only information from particular sources (i.e., healthcare providers 
and genetic counsellors) had positive and significant effects on people's 
perceptions of cancer regarding its prevention, detection and treatment 
(standardized β range, 0.15-0.31, all p-values &lt; 0.01). Following the paths, 
these perceptional variables (cancer prevention, detection and treatment) showed 
considerable positive impacts on the uptake of genetic testing (standardized β 
(95% CIs): 0.25 (0.20, 0.30), 0.28 (0.23, 0.33) and 0.12 (0.06, 0.17), 
respectively). Pathways involving attitudinal and psychosocial factors showed 
much smaller or insignificant effects on the uptake of genetic testing. Our 
study brings several novel perspectives to the behavior model and may underpin 
certain issues regarding cancer risk genetic testing."
1590,"Non-alcoholic fatty pancreas disease is a newly emerging disease that represents 
an important risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer. Obesity is a 
risk factor for pancreatic diseases, including pancreatitis and pancreatic 
cancer. On the other hand, the development of healthy aspects-based food 
products is a recent trend. Lactoferrin is a component of the body's immune 
system, which interacts with DNA, RNA, polysaccharides, and heparin, and it has 
many biological functions and many important immunomodulatory properties. Thus, 
this study aims to investigate the enhancement effect of supplementation of 
lactoferrin with stirred yogurt on weight gain, lipid profile, glucose level, 
and pancreatic enzymes in animals fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Forty-eight female 
albino rats were divided into 6 groups treated orally for 45 days as follows: 
negative control (basal diet), positive control (add 1% cholesterol), stirred 
yogurt (SY), Lactoferrin LF (100 mg/kg bw), supplementation of lactoferrin with 
stirred yogurt SY-LF at two concentrations LF1 (50 mg/kg bw) and LF2 (100 mg/kg 
bw). Blood and pancreas samples were collected for different analyses. Animals 
fed with a HFD showed a significant increase in body weight, total cholesterol, 
triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), glucose level, amylase, and Lipase 
enzymes (44.72%, 151.33 mg/dL, 142.67 mg/dL, 85.37 mg/dL, 141.33 mg/dL, 39.33 
U/mL, 23.43 U/mL). Moreover, it observed a significant decrease in high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL, 37.33 mg/dL); meanwhile, SY fortified with lactoferrin was 
useful in losing weight gain and improving lipid profile, pancreas function, and 
histological change in the pancreas. The supplementation of lactoferrin at 100 
mg/Kg bw with LB. Acidophilus as a probiotic was more effective for pancreas 
functions. This application is a natural protective alternative to manufactured 
medicines for children and the elderly as a natural product."
1591,"Recent studies have attempted to develop molecular signatures of epithelial 
ovarian cancer (EOC) based on the quantitation of protein-coding and non-coding 
RNAs to predict disease prognosis. Due to the heterogeneity of EOC, none of the 
developed prognostic signatures were directly applied in clinical practice. Our 
work focuses on high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) due to the highest 
mortality rate relative to other types of EOC. Using deep sequencing of small 
non-coding RNAs in combination with quantitative real-time PCR, we confirm the 
dualistic classification of epithelial ovarian cancers based on the miRNA 
signature of HGSOC (type 2), which differs from benign cystadenoma and 
borderline cystadenoma-precursors of low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (type 
1)-and identified two subtypes of HGSOC, which significantly differ in the level 
of expression of the progesterone receptor in the tumor tissue, the secretion of 
miR-16-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-93-5p, miR-20a-5p, the level of serum CA125, tumor 
size, surgical outcome (optimal or suboptimal cytoreduction), and response to 
chemotherapy. It was found that the combined determination of the level of 
miR-16-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, and miR-93-5p circulating in blood plasma of 
patients with primary HGSOC tumors makes it possible to predict optimal 
cytoreduction with 80.1% sensitivity and 70% specificity (p = 0.022, TPR = 0.8, 
FPR = 0.3), as well as complete response to adjuvant chemotherapy with 77.8% 
sensitivity and 90.9% specificity (p = 0.001, TPR = 0.78, FPR = 0.09). After the 
additional verification of the obtained data in a larger HGSOC patient cohort, 
the combined quantification of these four miRNAs is proposed to be used as a 
criterion for selecting patients either for primary cytoreduction or neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreduction."
1592,"Deciphering cancer etiopathogenesis has proven to be an especially challenging 
task since the mechanisms that drive tumor development and progression are far 
from simple. An astonishing amount of research has revealed a wide spectrum of 
defects, including genomic abnormalities, epigenomic alterations, disturbance of 
gene transcription, as well as post-translational protein modifications, which 
cooperatively promote carcinogenesis. These findings suggest that the adoption 
of a multidimensional approach can provide a much more precise and comprehensive 
picture of the tumor landscape, hence serving as a powerful tool in cancer 
research and precision oncology. The introduction of next- and third-generation 
sequencing technologies paved the way for the decoding of genetic information 
and the elucidation of cancer-related cellular compounds and mechanisms. In the 
present review, we discuss the current and emerging applications of both 
generations of sequencing technologies, also referred to as massive parallel 
sequencing (MPS), in the fields of cancer genomics, transcriptomics and 
proteomics, as well as in the progressing realms of epi-omics. Finally, we 
provide a brief insight into the expanding scope of sequencing applications in 
personalized cancer medicine and pharmacogenomics."
1593,"In this review, we provide an overview of the role of the insulin-like growth 
factor (IGF) signaling pathway in breast cancer and discuss its potential as a 
therapeutic target. The IGF pathway ligands, IGF-1 and IGF-2, and their 
receptors, primarily IGF-1R, are important for normal mammary gland biology, and 
dysregulation of their expression and function drives breast cancer risk and 
progression through activation of downstream signaling effectors, often in a 
subtype-dependent manner. The IGF signaling pathway has also been implicated in 
resistance to current therapeutic strategies, including ER and HER2 targeting 
drugs. Unfortunately, efforts to target IGF signaling for the treatment of 
breast cancer have been unsuccessful, due to a number of factors, most 
significantly the adverse effects of disrupting IGF signaling on normal glucose 
metabolism. We highlight here the recent discoveries that provide enthusiasm for 
continuing efforts to target IGF signaling for the treatment of breast cancer 
patients."
1594,"The World Health Organization (WHO), in their 2022 report, identified cancer as 
one of the leading causes of death, accounting for about 16% of deaths 
worldwide. The Cancer-Moonshot community aims to reduce the cancer death rate by 
half in the next 25 years and wants to improve the lives of cancer-affected 
people. Cancer mortality can be reduced if detected early and treated 
appropriately. Cancers like breast cancer and cervical cancer have high cure 
probabilities when treated early in accordance with best practices. Integration 
of artificial intelligence (AI) into cancer research is currently addressing 
many of the challenges where medical experts fail to bring cancer to control and 
cure, and the outcomes are quite encouraging. AI offers many tools and platforms 
to facilitate more understanding and tackling of this life-threatening disease. 
AI-based systems can help pathologists in diagnosing cancer more accurately and 
consistently, reducing the case error rates. Predictive-AI models can estimate 
the likelihood for a person to get cancer by identifying the risk factors. Big 
data, together with AI, can enable medical experts to develop customized 
treatments for cancer patients. The side effects from this kind of customized 
therapy will be less severe in comparison with the generalized therapies. 
However, many of these AI tools will remain ineffective in fighting against 
cancer and saving the lives of millions of patients unless they are accessible 
and understandable to biologists, oncologists, and other medical cancer 
researchers. This paper presents the trends, challenges, and future directions 
of AI in cancer research. We hope that this paper will be of help to both 
medical experts and technical experts in getting a better understanding of the 
challenges and research opportunities in cancer diagnosis and treatment."
1595,"(1) Background: This study aimed to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 
treatment-related adverse events when using PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). (2) Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis 
of Phase II/III randomized clinical trials. Studies were searched for using 
PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from 1 March 1980 till 30 June 2022. Data 
on adverse events were mainly extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov and published 
articles. A generalized linear mixed model with the logit transformation was 
employed to obtain the overall incidence of adverse events across all studies. 
For serious adverse events with low incidences, the Peto method was used to 
calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) in the PD-1 or 
PD-L1 inhibitors groups compared to the control groups. (3) Results: Nine 
studies were included in the meta-analysis, including a total of 2941 TNBC 
patients treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (including atezolizumab, 
pembrolizumab and durvalumab) and 2339 patients in the control groups. 
Chemotherapy alone was the control group in all studies. The average incidences 
of all serious immune-related adverse events of interest (hypothyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism, pneumonitis, pruritus, rash) were less than 1%, except for 
adrenal insufficiency (1.70%, 95%CI: 0.50-5.61%) in the PD-1 or PD-L1 groups. 
PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors significantly increased the risk of serious pneumonitis 
(OR = 2.52, 95%CI: 1.02-6.26), hypothyroidism (OR = 5.92, 95%CI: 1.22-28.86), 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation (OR = 1.66, 95%CI: 1.12-2.45), and 
adrenal insufficiency (OR = 18.81, 95%CI: 3.42-103.40). For non-serious adverse 
events, the patients treated with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors had higher risk of 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation (OR =1.26, 95%CI: 1.02-1.57), 
hypothyroidism (OR = 3.63, 95%CI: 2.92-4.51), pruritus (OR = 1.84, 95%CI: 
1.30-2.59), rash (OR = 1.29, 95%CI: 1.08-1.55), and fever (OR = 1.77, 95%CI: 
1.13-2.77), compared with chemotherapy alone. (4) Conclusions: The incidence of 
serious immune-related adverse events in PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors groups is low 
but significantly higher than in chemotherapy groups. When using PD-1 or PD-L1 
inhibitors for the treatment of TNBC, serious pneumonitis, hypothyroidism, ALT 
elevation, and adrenal insufficiency should be considered. Non-serious adverse 
events, such as AST elevation, rash, and fever, should also be taken into 
consideration."
1596,"Millions of people around the world are exposed to low doses of ionizing 
radiation from diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans. Currently available 
data on the potential cancer risk after CT scans are contradictory and therefore 
demand further investigations. The aim of the current study was to obtain 
estimations of genome damage after CT scans in 42 non-cancer patients and to 
conduct a comparison of the results with 22 control subjects. The frequency of 
dicentric ring chromosomes and chromosome breaks was significantly increased in 
irradiated patients compared to the controls. The distribution of dicentrics 
among the cells demonstrated non-Poisson distribution that reflected non-uniform 
and partial-body radiation exposure. A fraction of patients followed Poisson 
distribution, which is typical for uniform whole-body exposures. Some patients 
demonstrated a level of dicentrics similar to the control subjects. The 
individual variations in the frequency and dicentric distribution suggested 
complex mechanisms of chromosome aberration induction and elimination that could 
be associated with individual radiosensitivity, as well as previous diagnostics 
that used ionizing radiation or the redistribution of small fractions of 
irradiated lymphocytes within the circulatory pull. In conclusion, CT scans may 
cause genome damage and possible increases in cancer risk. The introduction of a 
specific follow-up of such patients, especially in the case of repeated CT 
scans, is suggested."
1597,"Bone is the most common metastatic site in prostate cancer (PCa). 68Ga-PSMA-11 
(or gozetotide) and sodium fluoride-18 (Na18F) are rather new 
radiopharmaceuticals for assessing PCa-associated bone metastases. Gozetotide 
uptake reflects cell membrane enzyme activity and the sodium fluoride uptake 
measures bone mineralization in advanced PCa. Here, we aim to characterize this 
difference and possibly provide a new method for patient selection in targeted 
therapies. Methods: The study consisted of 14 patients with advanced PCa (M 
group &gt; 5 lesions), who had had routine PET/CT both with PSMA and NaF over 
consecutive days, and 12 PCa patients with no skeletal metastases (N). The bone 
regions in CT were used to coregister the two PET/CT scans. The whole skeleton 
volume(s) of interest (VOIs) were defined using the CT component of PET (HU &gt; 
150); similarly, the sclerotic/dense bone was defined as HU &gt; 600. Additional 
VOIs were defined for PET, with pathological threshold values for PSMA (SUV &gt; 
3.0) and NaF (SUV &gt; 10). Besides the pathological bone volumes measured with 
each technique (CT, NaF, and PSMA-PET) and their contemporaneous combinations, 
overlapping VOIs with the CT-based skeletal and sclerotic volumes were also 
recorded. Additionally, thresholds of 4.0, 6.0, and 10.0 were tested for 
SUVPSMA. Results: In group M, the skeletal VOI volumes were 8.77 ± 1.80 L, and 
the sclerotic bone volumes were 1.32 ± 0.50 L; in contrast, in group N, they 
were 8.73 ± 1.43 L (skeletal) and 1.23 ± 0.28 L (sclerosis). The total enzyme 
activity for PSMA was 2.21 ± 5.15 in the M group and 0.078 ± 0.053 in the N 
group (p &lt; 0.0002). The total bone demineralization activity for NaF varied 
from 4.31 ± 6.17 in the M group and 0.24 ± 0.56 in group N (p &lt; 0.0002). The 
pathological PSMA volume represented 0.44-132% of the sclerotic bone volume in 
group M and 0.55-2.3% in group N. The pathological NaF volume in those patients 
with multiple metastases represented 0.27-68% of the sclerotic bone volume, and 
in the control group, only 0.00-6.5% of the sclerotic bone volume (p &lt; 
0.0003). Conclusions: These results confirm our earlier findings that CT alone 
does not suit the evaluation of the extent of active skeletal metastases in PCa. 
PSMA and NaF images give complementary information about the extent of the 
active skeletal disease, which has a clinical impact and may change its 
management. The PSMA and NaF absolute volumes could be used for planning 
targeted therapies. A cut-off value 3.0 for SUVPSMA given here is the best 
correlation in the presentation of active metastatic skeletal disease."
1598,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common heterogeneous 
conditions of the endocrine reproductive system in women of childbearing age. 
Hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea are the two core characteristics of PCOS, a 
complicated and multifaceted illness. The condition is also linked to several 
major side effects, which include type 2 diabetes, early atherosclerosis, 
infertility, and endometrial cancer. There are few facts and statistics 
available on PCOS prevalence internationally due to the significant degree of 
geographic and ethnic variance and inconsistency caused by different diagnosis 
standards. Limited (n = 179) explorations have been made in the context of the 
prevalence of this complicated illness so far, and out of these, only 55 studies 
have discussed its association with race and/or ethnicity. However, those 
studies remain restricted due to the small sample size, biased selection, and 
the lack of comparative studies. Variations in PCOS prevalence frequency also 
arise due to different diagnostic criteria, as well as racial and ethnic 
differences, associated lifestyle factors, and subsequent illnesses that affect 
the accuracy of the diagnosis. The main objective behind this systematic review 
is to provide comprehensive epidemiological data on PCOS that is organized 
geographically. This evidence-based study also provides an overview of the 
clinical management of PCOS to instigate further research on this complex 
endocrinological condition and the subsequent development of preventive 
treatment strategies."
1599,"Peritoneal tissue is the second most affected site by malignant mesothelioma 
linked to asbestos exposure. This scoping review aims to summarize the findings 
of the studies in which asbestos fibers in the peritoneum were quantified by 
electron microscopy, occasionally associated with spectroscopy, both in 
neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissue. The 9 studies selected comprised 62 cases, 
out of whom 100 samples were analyzed. Asbestos fibers were detected in 58 
samples (58%). In addition, 28 cases had diagnosis of peritoneal mesothelioma. 
For 32 cases, a lung tumor sample was available: 28/32 samples analyzed 
presented asbestos fibers; 18/32 reported amphiboles with a range from not 
detected to 14.2 million fibers per gram of dry tissue (mfgdt); 18/32 reported 
chrysotile, with a range of 0 to 90 mfgdt. The studies were heterogeneous for 
type of samples, analytical technology, and circumstances of exposure to 
asbestos. To evaluate asbestos fibers in the peritoneum and to better understand 
the association between asbestos exposure and malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, 
it is desirable that the search for asbestos fibers becomes a routine process 
every time peritoneal tissue is accessible."
1600,"The Hedgehog signaling pathway functions in both embryonic development and adult 
tissue homeostasis. Importantly, its aberrant activation is also implicated in 
the progression of multiple types of cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and 
medulloblastoma. GLI transcription factors function as the ultimate effectors of 
the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Their activity is regulated by this signaling 
cascade via their mRNA expression, protein stability, subcellular localization, 
and ultimately their transcriptional activity. Further, GLI proteins are also 
regulated by a variety of non-canonical mechanisms in addition to the canonical 
Hedgehog pathway. Recently, with an increased understanding of epigenetic gene 
regulation, novel transcriptional regulators have been identified that interact 
with GLI proteins in multi-protein complexes to regulate GLI transcriptional 
activity. Such complexes have added another layer of complexity to the 
regulation of GLI proteins. Here, we summarize recent work on the regulation of 
GLI transcriptional activity by these novel protein complexes and describe their 
relevance to cancer, as such GLI regulators represent alternative and innovative 
druggable targets in GLI-dependent cancers."
1601,"Early stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to the primary tumor combined 
with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EFGR-TKI) 
treatment may increase progression-free survival (PFS) by delaying resistance in 
patients with advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this 
prospective, single arm, phase II study, patients with advanced NSCLC were 
treated with EGFR-TKI (icotinib 125 mg tid or gefitinib 250 mg qd) for one month 
followed by SBRT (40-60 Gy/5-8 F/5-10 d) to the primary tumor with concurrent 
EGFR-TKI until disease progression. The primary endpoint was PFS and the 
patterns of failure. Overall survival (OS) and adverse effects (AEs) were 
secondary endpoints. Overall, 41 advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations 
received treatment with 24.42 months of median follow-up time. On average, SBRT 
was initiated 1.49 months after EGFR-TKI administration. Tumors were found to 
have an average shrinkage rate of 42.50%. Median PFS was 15.23 months (95% CI 
13.10-17.36), while median OS was 27.57 months (95% CI 23.05-32.09). 
Thirty-three patients were found to have disease progression, of which new site 
failure (NF) (22 patients, 66.66%) was the most common pattern, followed by 
original site failure (OF) (7 patients, 21.21%) and simultaneous OF/NF (ONF) (4 
patients, 12.12%). There were no Aes equal to or greater than grade 3, with the 
most frequent AE being radiation pneumonitis. Therefore, administering therapy 
targeted at the primary tumor using early SBRT after EGFR-TKI initiation is a 
new potentially safe and effective approach to treat EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC."
1602,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the highly susceptible genes to 
breast cancer (BC); however, the role of PTEN-related RNAs in BC remains poorly 
understood. Understanding the effect of PTEN-related RNAs and their mechanisms 
may be helpful to clinicians. We screened the differentially expressed RNAs 
(deRNAs) related to PTEN and established the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) 
network by integrating several databases. After that, the RNA model, prolactin 
receptor (PRLR)/calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 1 
(CACNA2D1), was obtained by KM survival analysis and logistic regression 
analysis. Finally, mutation, methylation, functional enrichment, and immune 
correlation were analyzed to explore the roles of these RNAs. Our results showed 
that PRLR might be harmful to BC, while CACNA2D1 might be beneficial to BC. 
Furthermore, the abnormal expression of PRLR in BC might result from mutation 
and hypomethylation, while the aberrant expression of CACNA2D1 might be ascribed 
to methylation. Mechanistically, PRLR might affect the prognosis of BC by 
inhibiting the expression of immune checkpoints, while CACNA2D1 might improve 
the prognosis of BC by increasing the immune cells infiltrating into BC and 
up-regulating the expression of immune checkpoints. The abnormal expression of 
PRLR and CACNA2D1 in BC is closely related to the prognosis of BC, and they may 
serve as targets for the treatment of BC."
1603,"In the last years, the TCGA-based molecular classifier have been progressively 
integrated in the management of endometrial carcinoma. While molecular assays 
are increasingly available across pathology laboratories, the additional costs 
will expectedly be compensated by a reduction in overtreatments and a prevention 
of recurrences. The additional time might be shortened by assessing molecular 
markers on biopsy specimens. Retrospective data suggest that the molecular 
classifier will have a major impact of on the risk stratification, with many 
patients having their risk class down- or upstaged based on POLE mutations or 
p53 abnormalities, respectively. However, there are still several issues to be 
resolved, such as the prognostic value of the TCGA classifier in each FIGO 
stage, or the type of adjuvant treatment most suitable for each molecular group. 
Other issues regard the prognostic stratification of the mismatch 
repair-deficient and ""no specific molecular profile"" groups, which currently 
follows the same criteria; however, the former seems to be prognostically 
consistent regardless of FIGO grade and histotype, whereas the latter appears 
highly heterogeneous. Numerous clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and 
molecular markers have been proposed to refine the TCGA classification, but 
their prognostic value is still undefined. Hopefully, prospective data collected 
in the next years will help resolving these issues."

worldwide. The outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer remain 
unsatisfactory. In the current review, we summarize the genetic and epigenetic 
architecture of metastatic pancreatic cancer beyond the BRCA mutations, focusing 
on the genetic alterations and the molecular pathology in pancreatic cancer. 
This review focuses on the molecular targets for the treatment of pancreatic 
cancer, with a correlation to future treatments. The potential approach 
addressed in this review may lead to the identification of a subset of patients

1605,"Langerhans cells (LCs) constitute a cellular immune network across the 
epidermis. Because they are located at the skin barrier, they are considered 
immune sentinels of the skin. These antigen-presenting cells are capable of 
migrating to skin draining lymph nodes to prime adaptive immune cells, namely T- 
and B-lymphocytes, which will ultimately lead to a broad range of immune 
responses. Moreover, LCs have been shown to possess important roles in the 
anti-cancer immune responses. Indeed, the literature nicely highlights the role 
of LCs in melanoma. In line with this, LCs have been found in melanoma tissues 
where they contribute to the local immune response. Moreover, the immunogenic 
properties of LCs render them attractive targets for designing vaccines to treat 
melanoma and autoimmune diseases. Overall, future studies will help to enlarge 
the portfolio of immune properties of LCs, and aid the prognosis and development 
of novel therapeutic approaches to treating skin pathologies, including cancers."
1606,"Background: Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) takes up a substantial fraction of 
dermatological and plastic surgical outpatient visits and surgeries. NMSC 
develops as an accumulated exposure to UV light with the face most frequently 
diagnosed. Method: This retrospective study investigated the risk of 
complications in relation to full-thickness skin grafts (FTSG) or local flaps in 
607 patients who underwent facial surgery and reconstruction at a high-volume 
center for facial cancer surgery at a tertiary university hospital. Results: 
Between 01.12.2017 and 30.11.2020, 304 patients received reconstructive flap 
surgery and 303 received FTSG following skin cancer removal in the face. Flap 
reconstruction was predominantly performed in the nasal region (78%, n = 237), 
whereas FTSG reconstruction was performed in the nasal (41,6%, n = 126), frontal 
(19.8%, n = 60), and temporal areas (19.8%, n = 60), respectively. Patients 
undergoing FTSGs had a significantly higher risk of hematoma (p = 0.003), 
partial necroses (p &lt; 0.001), and total necroses (p &lt; 0.001) compared to 
flap reconstruction. Age and sex increased the risk of major complications 
(hematoma, partial or total necrosis, wound dehiscence, or infection) for FTSG, 
revealing that men exhibited 3.72 times increased risk of major complications 
compared to women reconstructed with FTSG. A tumor size above 15 mm increased 
the risk of hematoma and necrosis significantly. In summary, local flaps for 
facial reconstruction after skin cancer provide lower complication rate compared 
with FTSGs, especially in elderly and/or male patients. The indication for FTSG 
should be considered critically if the patient's tumor size and location allow 
for both procedures."
1607,"Elevated levels of STIM1, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor/buffering 
protein, appear to be correlated with poor cancer prognosis in which microRNAs 
are also known to play critical roles. The purpose of this study is to 
investigate possible HBV origins of specific microRNAs we identified in a stem 
cell-like subpopulation of Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines with 
enhanced STIM1 and/or Orai1 expression that mimicked poor cancer prognosis. 
Computational strategies including phylogenetic analyses were performed on 
miRNome data we obtained from an EpCAM- and CD133-expressing Huh-7 HCC stem 
cell-like subpopulation with enhanced STIM1 and/or Orai1 expression originally 
cultured in the present work. Results revealed two putative regions in the HBV 
genome based on the apparent clustering pattern of stem loop sequences of 
microRNAs, including miR3653. Reciprocal analysis of these regions identified 
critical human genes, of which their transcripts are among the predicted targets 
of miR3653, which was increased significantly by STIM1 or Orai1 enhancement. 
Briefly, this study provides phylogenetic evidence for a possible HBV-driven 
epigenetic remodeling that alters the expression pattern of Ca2+ 
homeostasis-associated genes in STIM1- or Orai1 overexpressing liver cancer 
stem-like cells for a possible mutual survival outcome. A novel region on HBV-X 
protein may affect liver carcinogenesis in a genotype-dependent manner. 
Therefore, detection of the viral genotype would have a clinical impact on 
prognosis of HBV-induced liver cancers."
1608,"Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still one of the types of 
cancer with the highest death rates. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in 
NSCLC development. This study evaluates miRNA expression patterns and specific 
mechanisms in male patients with NSCLC. Methods: We report an integrated 
microarray analysis of miRNAs for eight matched samples of males with NSCLC 
compared to the study of public datasets of males with NSCLC from TCGA, followed 
by qRT-PCR validation. Results: For the TCGA dataset, we identified 385 
overexpressed and 75 underexpressed miRNAs. Our cohort identified 54 
overexpressed and 77 underexpressed miRNAs, considering a fold-change (FC) of 
±1.5 and p &lt; 0.05 as the cutoff value. The common miRNA signature consisted 
of eight overexpressed and nine underexpressed miRNAs. Validation was performed 
using qRT-PCR on the tissue samples for miR-183-3p and miR-34c-5p and on plasma 
samples for miR-34c-5p. We also created mRNA-miRNA regulatory networks to 
identify critical molecules, revealing NSCLC signaling pathways related to 
underexpressed and overexpressed transcripts. The genes targeted by these 
transcripts were correlated with overall survival. Conclusions: miRNAs and some 
of their target genes could play essential roles in investigating the mechanisms 
involved in NSCLC evolution and provide opportunities to identify potential 
therapeutic targets."
1609,"Peri-prosthetic breast infections pose a risk of severe complications after 
breast implant surgery. The need to remove the breast implant, control the 
infection and perform additional surgical procedures are the consequences. 
Reimplantation of an alloplastic implant is only appropriate after an 
infection-free interval. In this retrospective cohort study, we investigated the 
effectiveness of negative pressure wound treatment with instillation and dwell 
time (NPWTi-d) on peri-prosthetic breast infections in combination with implant 
removal and antibiotic therapy. Twelve patients treated with NPWTi-d due to 
breast implant infection were included in the study. The bacterial burden was 
analyzed using wound swabs before and after NPWTi-d. Additionally, laboratory 
values were determined before NPWTi-d and immediately before wound closure. A 
total of 13 peri-prosthetic breast infections in 12 patients were treated using 
implant removal and NPWTi-d. In 76.9% (n = 10) of the cases, the patients had 
undergone alloplastic breast reconstruction following cancer-related mastectomy, 
whereas 23.1% (n = 3) of the patients had undergone breast augmentation for 
cosmetic reasons. The bacterial burden in the breast pocket decreased 
statistically significant after implant removal and NPWTi-d. No shift from 
Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria was observed. Inflammatory markers 
rapidly decreased following treatment. NPWTi-d had a positive impact on the 
healing process after peri-prosthetic breast infections, leading to a decrease 
in bacterial burden within the wounds and contributing to uneventful healing. 
Therefore, secondary reimplantation of breast prostheses might be positively 
influenced when compared to conventional implant removal and simple secondary 
closure. Further studies are required to conclusively establish the beneficial 
long-term effects of using NPWTi-d for the treatment of peri-prosthetic breast 
infections."
1610,"The mucin (MUC) family includes several genes aberrantly expressed in multiple 
carcinomas and mediates diverse pathways essentials for oncogenesis, in both 
solid and hematological malignancies. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) can 
have its course influenced by genetic variants, and it seems more frequent in 
the Amerindian population, which has been understudied. Therefore, the present 
work aimed to investigate the MUC family exome in Amerindian individuals from 
the Brazilian Amazon, in a sample containing healthy Native Americans (NAMs) and 
indigenous subjects with ALL, comparing the frequency of polymorphisms between 
these two groups. The population was composed of 64 Amerindians from the 
Brazilian Amazon, from 12 different isolated tribes, five of whom were diagnosed 
with ALL. We analyzed 16 genes from the MUC family and found a total of 1858 
variants. We compared the frequency of each variant in the ALL vs. NAM group, 
which led to 77 variants with a significant difference and, among these, we 
excluded those with a low impact, resulting in 63 variants, which were 
distributed in nine genes, concentrated especially in MUC 19 (n = 30) and MUC 3A 
(n = 18). Finally, 11 new variants were found in the NAM population. This is the 
first work with a sample of native Americans with cancer, a population which is 
susceptible to ALL, but remains understudied. The MUC family seems to have an 
influence on the development of ALL in the Amerindian population and especially 
MUC19 and MUC3A are shown as possible hotspots. In addition, the 11 new variants 
found point to the need to have their clinical impact analyzed."
1611,"Genomic tests are being developed for use in cancer screening. As most screening 
is offered in primary care settings, primary care provider and patient 
perceptions of such tests are likely to affect uptake. We conducted a scoping 
review to synthesize information on factors likely to affect patient and 
provider use of biospecimen collection and analysis for cancer screening, 
methods referred to as liquid biopsy or multi-cancer early detection (MCED) 
testing when used to detect multiple cancers. We ultimately identified 7 
articles for review and analyzed them for major themes. None reported on primary 
care provider perspectives. Six articles focused on patient perceptions about 
testing for a single cancer (colorectal), and 1 reported on patient views 
related to testing for multiple cancers. Factors favoring this type of testing 
included its non-invasiveness, and the perceived safety, convenience, and 
effectiveness of testing. There is a dearth of information in the literature on 
primary care provider perceptions about liquid biopsy and MCED testing. The 
limited information on patient perceptions suggests that they are receptive to 
such tests. Research on primary care provider and patient test-related 
knowledge, attitudes, and behavior is needed to guide future implementation in 
primary care settings."
1612,"INTRODUCTION: To investigate the prognostic significance of liver tumor markers, 
the hemoglobin, albumin, lymphocyte, and platelet (HALP) score; 
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR); and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), 
for predicting the specific site of recurrence or metastasis after surgery in 
patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).
METHODS: In total, 162 patients with pathologically proven ICC who underwent 
curative surgery at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center between April 2016 and 
April 2020 were analyzed. Clinicopathological characteristics were collected 
retrospectively. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the overall 
survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Significant clinical factors 
were examined by univariate analysis and multivariate analysis and analyzed by 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
RESULTS: The cutoff values for the HALP score, NLR, and PLR were determined to 
be 43.63, 3.73, and 76.51, respectively, using the surv_cutpoint function of 
survminer using RFS as the target variable. In multivariate analysis, vascular 
invasion, pathology nerve tract invasion, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) 
levels were independent prognostic factors of OS, whereas the tumor number, 
pathology microvascular invasion, pathology differentiation, CA19-9 levels, and 
NLR were independent prognostic factors of RFS. For the whole recurrence 
analysis, the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) index exhibited the largest ROC 
curve area of all (AUC = 0.590), and the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) index exhibited 
the smallest ROC curve area (AUC = 0.530). The HALP score exhibited the largest 
ROC curve area of all in predicting intrahepatic recurrence (AUC = 0.588), the 
NLR showed the best predictive value in predicting lymph node metastasis (AUC = 
0.703), and the AUC of the CA19-9 index was the largest of all variables in 
predicting distant metastasis (AUC = 0.619).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that CA19-9, CEA, HALP score, and NLR are easily 
accessible, reliable, cost-effective indexes for predicting the specific site of 
recurrence or metastasis after surgery in ICC patients. Patients with high HALP 
scores and NLR have a higher risk of intrahepatic and lymph node metastasis 
recurrence."
1613,"Gastric cancer is ranked fifth among the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and is 
the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The majority of 
gastric cancers are sporadic, while only a small percentage, less than 1%, are 
hereditary. Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is a rare malignancy, 
characterized by early-onset, highly-penetrant autosomal dominant inheritance 
mainly of the germline alterations in the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) and β-catenin 
(CTNNA1). In the present study, we provide an overview on the molecular basis of 
HDGC and outline the essential elements of genetic counseling and surveillance. 
We further provide a practical summary of current guidelines on clinical 
management and treatment of individuals at risk and patients with early disease."
1614,"Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common female cancer. Excellent clinical 
outcomes have been achieved with current screening tests and medical treatments 
in the early stages, while the advanced stage has a poor prognosis. Nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism is implicated in cancer development and 
has been enhanced as a new therapeutic concept for cancer treatment. This study 
set out to identify an NAD+ metabolic-related gene signature for the prospect of 
cervical cancer survival and prognosis. Tissue profiles and clinical 
characteristics of 293 cervical cancer patients and normal tissues were 
downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to obtain NAD+ 
metabolic-related genes. Based on the differentially expressed NAD+ 
metabolic-related genes, cervical cancer patients were divided into two 
subgroups (Clusters 1 and 2) using consensus clustering. In total, 1404 
differential genes were acquired from the clinical data of these two subgroups. 
From the NAD+ metabolic-related genes, 21 candidate NAD+ metabolic-related genes 
(ADAMTS10, ANGPTL5, APCDD1L, CCDC85A, CGREF1, CHRDL2, CRP, DENND5B, EFS, FGF8, 
P4HA3, PCDH20, PCDHAC2, RASGRF2, S100P, SLC19A3, SLC6A14, TESC, TFPI, TNMD, 
ZNF229) were considered independent indicators of cervical cancer prognosis 
through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The 21-gene 
signature was significantly different between the low- and high-risk groups in 
the training and validation datasets. Our work revealed the promising clinical 
prediction value of NAD+ metabolic-related genes in cervical cancer."
1615,"Molecular and genomic properties are critical in selecting cancer treatments to 
target individual tumors, particularly for immunotherapy. However, the methods 
to assess such properties are expensive, time-consuming, and often not routinely 
performed. Applying machine learning to H&E images can provide a more 
cost-effective screening method. Dozens of studies over the last few years have 
demonstrated that a variety of molecular biomarkers can be predicted from H&E 
alone using the advancements of deep learning: molecular alterations, genomic 
subtypes, protein biomarkers, and even the presence of viruses. This article 
reviews the diverse applications across cancer types and the methodology to 
train and validate these models on whole slide images. From bottom-up to 
pathologist-driven to hybrid approaches, the leading trends include a variety of 
weakly supervised deep learning-based approaches, as well as mechanisms for 
training strongly supervised models in select situations. While results of these 
algorithms look promising, some challenges still persist, including small 
training sets, rigorous validation, and model explainability. Biomarker 
prediction models may yield a screening method to determine when to run 
molecular tests or an alternative when molecular tests are not possible. They 
also create new opportunities in quantifying intratumoral heterogeneity and 
predicting patient outcomes."
1616,"(1) Background: As prescribers, physicians play a decisive role in applying and 
promoting pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing in clinical practices. So far, little is 
known about physicians' perspectives on PGx testing in China. The aim of this 
study was to assess physicians' knowledge of, attitude towards, and experience 
of PGx testing in China. (2) Methods: A 39-question online survey was developed. 
Participants were physicians recruited through two platforms, MEDLINKER and 
""Dazhuanjia"". (3) Results: A total of 450 respondents completed the survey and 
366 questionnaires were eligible for analysis based on the inclusion criteria. 
Among all included physicians, 275 (75.1%) had heard of PGx testing before. More 
than half rated their knowledge of PGx testing as ""Fair"" (61.5%) while 20.0% 
chose ""Excellent"" or ""Good"" and 18.6% chose ""Poor"" or ""Terrible"". ""Guidelines, 
consensus, and treatment paths for disease diagnosis and treatment"" (72.7%) were 
the most preferred sources of information about PGx testing. Respondents were 
confident in their personal capacity to conduct PGx, with an average score of 
3.30 ± 0.09 (out of 5.00). Most respondents (75.6%) believed that PGx could 
""help to improve efficacy and reduce the incidence of adverse reactions"". 
Targeted cancer therapy (score 78.95 ± 1.26 out of 100) was considered the field 
where PGx testing had its highest value. Lack of professionals and knowledge (n 
= 186, 67.6%), high costs of testing (n = 170, 61.8%), and lack of hospitals to 
offer PGx testing (n = 166, 60.4%) were identified as the primary obstacles to 
increasing the uptake of PGx testing in China. Academic conference (n = 213, 
72.4%) was considered the most efficient way for physicians to obtain 
information about PGx testing. (4) Conclusions: Physicians in China have poor 
knowledge about PGx testing; nonetheless, they generally had confidence in their 
capacity to order PGx testing and positive attitudes towards the use of PGx 
testing in routine clinical practices. Future efforts to promote the uptake of 
PGx testing should focus on foundational education and practical training."
1617,"Several authors reported an increased risk of cancer in SSc patients, including 
breast cancer (BC). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying this association 
have not yet been clarified. SSc and BC share several molecular pathways, which 
seem to play a common etiopathogenetic role. The previously published 
Sclero-Breast study demonstrated the development of BC with a good prognosis 
among these patients, which could be explained by an autoimmune background as a 
possible mechanism for limiting tumor extension. Here, we report the results of 
an IHC analysis of molecular pathways known to be common drivers for both 
diseases, with the aim to better define the mechanisms underlying a good 
prognosis of BC in patients affected by SSc. The analysis demonstrated higher 
TILs rates in all BC subgroups, with a high rate of PD-L1 expression especially 
in TNBC and HER2-positive BC, suggesting a less aggressive behavior in these 
patients compared to the general population. These results support a possible 
de-escalation strategy of cancer therapies in these fragile patients. These data 
could represent a starting point for future prospective studies based on the 
clinical application of these biomarkers with a larger sample size to promote a 
personalized and targeted oncological treatment for this specific subset of 
patients."
1618,"Loss of CDH1/Cadherin-1 is a common step towards the acquisition of an abnormal 
epithelial phenotype. In gastric cancer (GC), mutation and/or downregulation of 
CDH1/Cadherin-1 is recurrent in sporadic and hereditary diffuse GC type. To 
approach the molecular events downstream of CDH1/Cadherin-1 alterations and 
their relevance in gastric carcinogenesis, we queried public databases for 
genetic and DNA methylation data in search of molecular signatures with a 
still-uncertain role in the pathological mechanism of GC. In all GC subtypes, 
modulated genes correlating with CDH1/Cadherin-1 aberrations are associated with 
stem cell and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathways. A higher level of 
genes upregulated in CDH1-mutated GC cases is associated with reduced overall 
survival. In the diffuse GC (DGC) subtype, genes downregulated in CDH1-mutated 
compared to cases with wild type CDH1/Cadherin-1 resulted in being strongly 
intertwined with the DREAM complex. The inverse correlation between 
hypermethylated CpGs and CDH1/Cadherin-1 transcription in diverse subtypes 
implies a common epigenetic program. We identified nonredundant protein-encoding 
isoforms of 22 genes among those differentially expressed in GC compared to 
normal stomach. These unique proteins represent potential agents involved in 
cell transformation and candidate therapeutic targets. Meanwhile, drug-induced 
and CDH1/Cadherin-1 mutation-related gene expression comparison predicts FIT, 
GR-127935 hydrochloride, amiodarone hydrochloride in GC and BRD-K55722623, 
BRD-K13169950, and AY 9944 in DGC as the most effective treatments, providing 
cues for the design of combined pharmacological treatments. By integrating 
genetic and epigenetic aspects with their expected functional outcome, we 
unveiled promising targets for combinatorial pharmacological treatments of GC."
1619,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the deadliest 
malignancies. Elevated regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration has a potent 
immunosuppressive function in tumor biology, which contributes to low survival 
in PDAC. Nonetheless, the crosstalk between malignant cells and 
tumor-infiltrating Tregs in PDAC is not well understood. Here, clinical data 
demonstrates that the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) is 
associated with Treg accumulation in the microenvironment of PDAC in humans. 
Additionally, IGFBP2 increases Treg infiltration in the tumor microenvironment 
and promotes disease progression in mouse PDAC. Bioinformatic analysis and 
mechanistic assessment reveals IGFBP2 upregulated indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 
(IDO) by activating signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) 
signaling in PDAC cells, thus inducing Treg differentiation and an 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These findings provide mechanistic 
insights into an important molecular pathway that promotes an immunosuppressive 
microenvironment, which suggests the IGFBP2 axis as a potential target for 
improved immune response in PDAC."
1620,"Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) has a poor prognosis, and its therapeutic 
strategy has not been established. PRELP is a leucine-rich repeat protein in the 
extracellular matrix of connective tissues. Although PRELP anchors the basement 
membrane to the connective tissue and is absent in most epithelial cancers, much 
remains unknown regarding its function as a regulator of ligand-mediated 
signaling pathways. Here, we obtained sets of differentially expressed genes by 
PRELP expression using OCCC cell lines. We found that more than 1000 genes were 
significantly altered by PRELP expression, particularly affecting the expression 
of a group of genes involved in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, we 
revealed the loss of active histone marks on the loci of the PRELP gene in 
patients with OCCC and how its forced expression inhibited cell proliferation. 
These findings suggest that PRELP is not only a molecule anchored in connective 
tissues but is also a signaling molecule acting in a tumor-suppressive manner. 
It can serve as the basis for early detection and novel therapeutic approaches 
for OCCC toward precision medicine."
1621,"In clinical trials of cancer drugs, grouping by age is a very common grouping 
method, as it can allow for a visual comparison of the different pharmaceutical 
responses in patients at different age stages. Under the guidance of this 
thinking, many researchers use age grouping when studying clinical cancer drugs. 
However, even people at the same age may be at different stages in their lives, 
such as individuals who are going through puberty, menopause/andropause, or 
intermediate transition, as well as childhood and old age, affected by factors 
such as hormone levels, immune responses, ethnic groups, and regions. Every 
individual has different cancer symptoms and responses to drugs; therefore, the 
experimental effect of life stage grouping will be more obvious and clearer. Not 
only does this conclusion apply to cancer drugs, but it also applies to clinical 
trials for other diseases. In addition, this does not mean that age grouping 
should be completely abandoned. Life stage is a more general interval that can 
be further divided into life stage groups according to the age of the patients. 
Based on the principal law of lifespan (PLOSP), age trends in life stages also 
need to be updated from time to time. To date, life stage grouping has not been 
discussed systematically and has not been used as a grouping method for cancer 
patients. In this paper, life stage grouping is discussed as one of the 
important grouping categories in cancer clinical trials."
1622,"The objective of the present pilot study is to compare operative outcomes 
between vaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) and 
single-port access (SPA) adnexectomy. Subjects were patients who underwent 
adnexectomy for benign adnexal disease, from November 2019 to May 2021. A total 
of 12 patients underwent vNOTES adnexectomy, and 55 patients received SPA 
laparoscopic adnexectomy. All surgeries were performed by one surgeon. In order 
to balance the baseline characteristics of the patients, 1:2 matching was 
performed. The vNOTES group demonstrated a low postoperative pain score within 
12 h after surgery. They also required less use of analgesic medications 
postoperatively. Other surgical outcomes were comparable between the two groups. 
This study showed that vNOTES adnexectomy has comparable surgical outcomes to 
SPA."
1623,"(1) Background: Hormone receptor positive breast cancer is a subtype of breast 
cancer with relatively good prognosis, but luminal B (HER-2 negative) breast 
cancer has a higher risk of recurrence and metastasis. Patients with endocrine 
therapy resistance and chemotherapy insensitivity have poor prognosis. Androgen 
receptor (AR) is widely expressed in breast cancer, but there is no clear 
conclusion about its function and correlation with prognosis in luminal B breast 
cancer. Further research is needed to reveal the role of AR in luminal B (HER-2 
negative) breast cancer. (2) Methods: Retrospectively analyzed patients with 
early-stage luminal B breast cancer. The correlation between AR and its 
associated indexes with long-term survival was determined. (3) Results: A total 
of 985 patients were included with 143 treated by neoadjuvant therapy. Of these, 
83.5% of the patients had AR expression ≥65%. High AR expression was associated 
with good disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). In the 
neoadjuvant population, AR/estrogen receptor (ER) &gt; 1.06 and residual tumor 
Ki67 &gt; 23% had significantly worse DFS. (4) Conclusion: Low AR (&lt;65%) 
expression is associated with poor prognosis in luminal B (HER-2 negative) 
breast cancer patients. High AR/ER and residual tumor Ki67 were associated with 
poor DFS in neoadjuvant group with a cutoff value of AR/ER &gt; 1.06 and 
residual tumor Ki67 &gt; 23%."
1624,"Purpose: The present study reports the preliminary outcomes in terms of adverse 
events and quality of life in the first 100 patients treated with 1.5T MR-guided 
daily-adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Methods: From 
October 2019 to December 2020, 100 patients, enrolled in a prospective study, 
received MR-guided SBRT for prostate cancer. Rectal spacer insertion was 
optional and administered in 37 patients. In total, 32 patients received 
androgen deprivation therapy in accordance with international guidelines. A 
prospective collection of data regarding toxicity and quality of life was 
performed. Results: The median age was 71 years (range, 52-84). The median total 
dose delivered was 35 Gy (35-36.25 Gy) in five sessions, either on alternate 
days (n = 25) or consecutive days (n = 75). For acute toxicity, we recorded: 
seven cases of acute G2 urinary pain and four cases of G2 gastrointestinal 
events. The median follow-up was 12 months (3-20), recording three late G2 
urinary events and one G3 case, consisting of a patient who required a TURP 8 
months after the treatment. For gastrointestinal toxicity, we observed 3 G ≥ 2 
GI events, including one patient who received argon laser therapy for 
radiation-induced proctitis. Up to the last follow-up, all patients are alive 
and with no evidence of biochemical relapse, except for an M1 low-volume patient 
in distant progression two months after radiotherapy. QoL evaluation reported a 
substantial resolution of any discomfort within the second follow-up after 
radiotherapy, with the only exception being sexual items. Notably, after one 
year, global health items were improved compared to the baseline assessment. 
Conclusions: This study reports very promising outcomes in terms of adverse 
events and QoL, supporting the role of 1.5T MR-guided SBRT for prostate cancer. 
To date, this series is one of the first and largest available in the 
literature. Long-term results are warranted."
1625,"The Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB) is an electronic health record (EHR)-linked 
biobank at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Medicine). A large variety of 
health-related information, ranging from diagnosis codes to laboratory 
measurements, imaging data and lifestyle information, is integrated with genomic 
and biomarker data in the PMBB to facilitate discoveries and translational 
science. To date, 174,712 participants have been enrolled into the PMBB, 
including approximately 30% of participants of non-European ancestry, making it 
one of the most diverse medical biobanks. There is a median of seven years of 
longitudinal data in the EHR available on participants, who also consent to 
permission to recontact. Herein, we describe the operations and infrastructure 
of the PMBB, summarize the phenotypic architecture of the enrolled participants, 
and use body mass index (BMI) as a proof-of-concept quantitative phenotype for 
PheWAS, LabWAS, and GWAS. The major representation of African-American 
participants in the PMBB addresses the essential need to expand the diversity in 
genetic and translational research. There is a critical need for a ""medical 
biobank consortium"" to facilitate replication, increase power for rare 
phenotypes and variants, and promote harmonized collaboration to optimize the 
potential for biological discovery and precision medicine."
1626,"Gliomas are relatively rare but fatal cancers, and there has been insufficient 
research to specifically evaluate the role of headache as a risk factor. 
Nowadays, gliomas are difficult to cure due to the infiltrative nature and the 
absence of specific adjuvant therapies. Until now, mutations in hundreds of 
genes have been identified in gliomas and most relevant discoveries showed 
specific genes alterations related to migraine as potential risk factors for 
brain tumor onset. Prognostic biomarkers are required at the time of diagnosis 
to better adapt therapies for cancer patients. In this review, we aimed to 
highlight the significant modulation of CLOCK, BMLA1 and NOTCH genes in glioma 
onset and development, praising these genes to be good as potentially attractive 
therapeutic markers for brain tumors. A improved knowledge regarding the role of 
these genes in triggering or modulating glioma maybe the key to early diagnosing 
brain tumor onset in patients affected by a simple headache. In addition, 
investigating on these genes we can suggest potential therapeutic targets for 
treating brain tumors. These considerations open up the possibility of 
personalized treatments that can target each brain tumor's specific genetic 
abnormality."
1627,"In 1979, development of the first polymer drug SMANCS [styrene-co-maleic acid 
(SMA) copolymer conjugated to neocarzinostatin (NCS)] by Maeda and colleagues 
was a breakthrough in the cancer field. When SMANCS was administered to mice, 
drug accumulation in tumors was markedly increased compared with accumulation of 
the parental drug NCS. This momentous result led to discovery of the enhanced 
permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) in 1986. Later, the EPR effect 
became known worldwide, especially in nanomedicine, and is still believed to be 
a universal mechanism for tumor-selective accumulation of nanomedicines. Some 
research groups recently characterized the EPR effect as a controversial concept 
and stated that it has not been fully demonstrated in clinical settings, but 
this erroneous belief is due to non-standard drug design and use of 
inappropriate tumor models in investigations. Many research groups recently 
provided solid evidence of the EPR effect in human cancers (e.g., renal and 
breast), with significant diversity and heterogeneity in various patients. In 
this review, we focus on the dynamics of the EPR effect and restoring tumor 
blood flow by using EPR effect enhancers. We also discuss new applications of 
EPR-based nanomedicine in boron neutron capture therapy and photodynamic therapy 
for solid tumors."
1628,"Recent studies on patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) undergoing 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) have shown an association between NAC and 
thromboembolic events (TEE) prior to radical cystectomy (RC). Recent studies 
suggest that central venous access catheters (CVAs) may induce TEEs, and 
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has been mentioned as possible prophylaxis. 
However, other studies have shown a high incidence of decreased renal function 
in these patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the portion of 
MIBC patients with NAC-induced TEEs who had decreased preoperative renal 
function for whom LMWH potentially would not be beneficial as prophylaxis. We 
identified 459 cystectomized MIBC patients from two Swedish medical centers from 
2009 to 2021. The inclusion criterion of cT2-T4aN0M0 resulted in 220 eligible 
patients, who were further divided into NAC-administered (n = 187) and 
NAC-eligible (n = 33), the tentative control group. Values of renal function 
before, during, and after each NAC cycle were retrospectively collected from 
individual medical records. Amongst the NAC-administered patients with TEE (n = 
29), 41% (95% CI 23.5-61.1%) of patients had decreased renal function. Thus, a 
substantial portion of NAC-administered patients who developed TEEs had reduced 
renal function and would have been less likely to have benefited from renal 
clearance-dependent LMWH prophylaxis."
1629,"This study aimed to provide basic data for the clinical application of urine 
samples to prevent cervical cancer due to persistent HR-HPV infection in women 
who refuse invasive cervical sampling. Pairs of cervical swabs and urine samples 
were collected from 210 asymptomatic women who visited the obstetrics and 
gynecology department from August to December 2020, and a total of 420 samples 
were collected. Using the PANA RealTyper™ HPV Screening Kit as a real-time PCR 
method, paired cervical swabs and random urine samples were tested. A total of 
19 samples (9.1%) were both HPV positive and 177 (84.3%) were both negative. The 
concordance between the two types of samples was 93.3%, with κ = 0.69 (moderate, 
95% CI 0.54-0.84). The HPV infection rate by age was highest in both cervical 
swabs and urine samples in women in their 30s, followed by those in their 20s. 
Thus, the HPV infection rate was high in young women under 40 at 69.2% in 
cervical swabs and 61.8% in urine samples. Urine samples are considered a 
valuable screening test for women who refuse invasive Pap tests to prevent 
cervical cancer caused by persistent HPV infection."
1630,"Despite the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) having partially improved in 
recent years, LUAD patients still have poor prognosis rates. Therefore, it is 
especially important to explore effective biomarkers and exploit novel 
therapeutic developments. High-throughput technologies are widely used as 
systematic approaches to explore differences in expressions of thousands of 
genes for both biological and genomic systems. Recently, using big data analyses 
in biomedicine research by integrating several high-throughput databases and 
tools, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), cBioportal, Oncomine, and 
Kaplan-Meier plotter, is an important strategy to identify novel biomarkers for 
cancer therapy. Here, we used two different comprehensive bioinformatics 
analysis and revealed protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type (PTPN) 
family genes, especially PTPN1 and PTPN22, were downregulated in lung cancer 
tissue in comparison with normal samples. The survival curves indicated that 
LUAD patients with high transcription levels of PTPN5 were significantly 
associated with a good prognosis. Meanwhile, Gene Ontology (GO) and MetaCore 
analyses indicated that co-expression of the PTPN1, PTPN5, and PTPN21 genes was 
significantly enriched in cancer development-related pathways, including GTPase 
activity, regulation of small GTPase-mediated signal transduction, response to 
mechanical stimuli, vasculogenesis, organ morphogenesis, regulation of stress 
fiber assembly, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, cell migration, 
and angiogenesis. Collectively, this study revealed that PTPN family members are 
both significant prognostic biomarkers for lung cancer progression and promising 
clinical therapeutic targets, which provide new targets for treating LUAD 
patients."
1631,"The management of patients with L-SIL/ASCUS cytology is controversial and not 
clearly standardized.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the risk factors associated with H-SIL/CIN2+ in a cohort 
of patients with ASCUS or L-SIL in a Pap smear.
METHODS: Between 2012 and 2022, 1259 eligible women with ASCUS/L-SIL were 
referred for colposcopy. The risk factors associated with H-SIL/CIN2+ were 
analyzed. The colposcopic study, conventional or assisted with dynamic spectral 
imaging (DSI), was performed in all cases. Guided biopsies were performed in 
cases of abnormal examination or random biopsies when no lesions were found. A 
LEEP was performed in H-SIL/CIN2+ results or persistent LSIL/CIN.
RESULTS: A normal or metaplastic specimen was found in 750 women (63.2%), 
LSIL/CIN1 in 346 (29.1%), and H-SIL/CIN2+ in 92 (7.7%). The presence of HR-HPV 
(OR = 2.1; IC 95% = 1.4-3.2), smoking habits (OR = 2.2; IC 95% = 1.4-3.5), and 
the performance of DSI combined with colposcopy (OR = 0.6; IC 95% = 0.37-0.83) 
were the factors associated with the detection of H-SIL/CIN2+. A summative 
effect of HR-HPV and smoking habit (OR = 2.9; IC 95% = 1.7-5.0) was observed in 
the detection of H-SIL/CIN2+. In multivariate analysis, the presence of HPV 
16/18 was the unique independent factor associated with H-SIL/CIN2+.
CONCLUSION: In women carrying an ASCUS/LSIL in the Pap smear, the unique 
independent factor predictive of H-SIL/CIN2+ is the presence of the HPV 16/18 
genotype. Smoking women carrying ASCUS/LSIL with HR-HPV should be targeted for 
stricter follow-up to avoid an unsuspected H-SIL/CIN2+."
1632,"Obesity is a chronic disease in which abnormal deposition of fat threatens 
health, leading to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other chronic 
illnesses. According to the WHO, 19.8% of the adult population in Italy is 
obese, and the prevalence is higher among men. It is important to know the 
predisposition of an individual to become obese and to respond to bariatric 
surgery, the most up-to-date treatment for severe obesity. To this purpose, we 
developed an NGS gene panel, comprising 72 diagnostic genes and 244 candidate 
genes, and we sequenced 247 adult obese Italian patients. Eleven deleterious 
variants in 9 diagnostic genes and 17 deleterious variants in 11 candidate genes 
were identified. Interestingly, mutations were found in several genes correlated 
to the Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Then, 25 patients were clinically followed to 
evaluate their response to bariatric surgery. After a 12-month follow-up, the 
patients that carried deleterious variants in diagnostic or candidate genes had 
a reduced weight loss, as compared to the other patients. The NGS-based panel, 
including diagnostic and candidate genes used in this study, could play a role 
in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing obese individuals, and may help in 
predicting the outcome of bariatric surgery."
1633,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths 
worldwide, and 20% of patients with CRC present at diagnosis with metastases. 
The treatment of metastatic CRC is based on a fluoropyrimidine-based 
chemotherapy plus additional agents such as oxaliplatin and irinotecan. To date, 
on the basis of the molecular background, targeted therapies (e.g., monoclonal 
antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor or inhibiting angiogenesis) 
are administered to improve the treatment of metastatic CRC. In addition, more 
recently, immunological agents emerged as effective in patients with a defective 
mismatch repair system. The administration of targeted therapies and 
immunotherapy lead to a significant increase in the survival of patients; 
however these drugs do not always prove effective. In most cases the lack of 
effectiveness is due to the development of primary resistance, either a 
resistance-inducing factor is already present before treatment or resistance is 
acquired when it occurs after treatment initiation. In this review we describe 
the most relevant targeted therapies and immunotherapies and expand on the 
reasons for resistance to the different approved or under development targeted 
drugs. Then we showed the possible mechanisms and drugs that may lead to 
overcoming the primary or acquired resistance in metastatic CRC."
1634,"BACKGROUND: Data on epidemiologic features, treatments and outcomes in women 
diagnosed with ovarian malignancy during pregnancy are very sparse due to its 
low incidence. The goal of our study was to summarize the epidemiologic 
characteristics of pregnant women complicated with ovarian malignancy and 
investigate the safety and efficacy of chemotherapy during pregnancy.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological data of eight 
patients suffering from ovarian malignancy during pregnancy in our institution 
from June 2011 to July 2021. Furthermore, a systematic literature search was 
conducted in PubMed up to 1 September 2021, which identified 92 cases with 
ovarian malignancy during pregnancy eligible for the analysis. Therefore, we 
collected the data of 100 pregnant patients complicated with ovarian malignancy, 
including clinical demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment interventions 
and outcomes.
RESULTS: In total, 100 pregnant patients complicated with ovarian malignancy 
were investigated and classified into three groups: 34 cases in the epithelial 
ovarian cancer (EOC) group, 38 cases in the germ cell tumors (GCTs) group and 28 
cases in the sex cord-stromal tumors (SCSTs) group. The onset age of pregnant 
patients with epithelial ovarian cancer was significantly higher than that of 
other patients. Pelvic mass and abdominal pain were the common clinical 
presentations of pregnant patients with ovarian malignancy. For distinguishing 
epithelial ovarian cancer during pregnancy, the area under the curve (AUC) of 
CA-125 was 0.718 with an optimal cutoff value of 58.2 U/mL. Moreover, 53 
patients underwent surgery during pregnancy, the majority of whom underwent 
unilateral adnexectomy in the second trimester. Furthermore, 43 patients 
received chemotherapy during pregnancy, and 28 delivered completely healthy 
newborns at birth; 13 neonates showed transient abnormalities without further 
complications; and 2 died during the neonatal period.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals the safety of chemotherapy for ovarian malignancy 
during pregnancy. However, large-sample prospective studies are still needed to 
further explore the safety of chemotherapy in pregnant patients with malignancy 
to choose the appropriate chemotherapy regimen and achieve the maximum benefit 
for patients."
1635,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, elective surgery has to undergo longer 
wait times, including nephrectomy for T1 renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study 
aimed to investigate the time-to-surgery (TTS) of Chinese T1 RCC patients and 
its influencing factors, and to illustrate the impact of TTS on the prognosis of 
T1 RCC.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 762 Chinese patients with pathological T1 
RCC that underwent nephrectomy. To discover the impact of TTS on survival 
outcomes, we explored the possible delay intervals by week using the 
Kaplan-Meier method and Log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard models with 
inverse probability-treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to assess the 
association between TTS and disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival 
(OS).
RESULTS: The median TTS of T1 RCC patients was 15 days. The Charlson comorbidity 
index, the Preoperative Aspects and Dimensions Used for an Anatomical (PADUA) 
score, and the maximal tumor diameter on presentation were independent 
influencing factors for TTS. The cut-off point of TTS was selected as 5 weeks 
according to the Log-rank analysis. For T1a RCC, patients with TTS &gt; 5 weeks 
had similar DFS (HR = 2.39; 95% CI, 0.82-6.94; p = 0.109) and OS (HR = 1.28; 95% 
CI, 0.23-7.16; p = 0.779) compared to patients with TTS ≤ 5 weeks. For T1b RCC, 
patients with TTS &gt; 5 weeks had shorter DFS (HR = 2.90; 95% CI = 1.46-5.75; p 
= 0.002) and OS (HR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.09-5.70; p = 0.030) than patients with 
TTS ≤ 5 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged TTS had no impact on the prognosis of T1a RCC while 
surgery delayed for over 5 weeks may lead to worse survival in T1b RCC."
1636,"Inflammation is related to cancer. The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) 
has been linked to the prognosis of many types of cancer. The present study 
aimed to determine the prognostic value of the SII in glioblastoma (GBM) 
patients based on meta-analysis and single-center retrospective analysis. 
Relevant publications published before 1 October 2022 were identified by 
searching PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, and Web of Science. 
Moreover, 208 GBM patients from Zhongnan Hospital were incorporated. 
Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses determined the prognostic significance 
of inflammatory markers. By combining these indicators, we developed scoring 
systems. Nomograms were also built by incorporating independent variables. The 
accuracies of nomograms were evaluated by Harrell's concordance index (c-index) 
and the calibration curve. According to meta-analysis, an elevated SII predicted 
the worst overall survival (OS) (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.87, p &lt; 0.001). 
Furthermore, a higher SII (&gt;510.8) (HR = 1.782, p = 0.007) also predicted a 
poorer outcome in a retrospective cohort. The scoring systems of SII-NLR 
(neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) showed the best predictive power for OS. The 
nomogram without MGMT (c-index = 0.843) exhibited a similar accuracy to that 
with MGMT (c-index = 0.848). A pre-treatment SII is independently associated 
with OS in GBM. A nomogram integrating the SII-NLR score may facilitate a 
comprehensive survival evaluation independent of molecular tests in GBM."
1637,"Cuproptosis is a newly discovered type of cell death. The role and potential 
mechanism of Cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in the prognosis of cancer 
patients are not fully understood. In this study, we included two cohorts of 
clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients, TCGA and E-MTAB-1980. The TCGA cohort 
is used as a training set to construct a CRG signature using the LASSO-cox 
regression analysis, and E-MTAB-1980 is used as a cohort for verification. A 
total of eight genes (FDX1, LIAS, LIPT1, DLAT, PDHA1, MTF1, GLS, CDKN2A) were 
screened to construct a prognostic model in the TCGA cohort. There is a 
significant difference in OS (p &lt; 0.0001) between the high and low 
cuproptosis score group, and a similar difference is also observed in the OS (p 
= 0.0054) of the E-MTAB-1980 cohort. The area under the ROC curves (AUC) were 
0.87, 0.82, and 0.78 at 1, 3, and 5 years in the TCGA cohort, respectively. 
Finally, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that CRGs were associated with 
cell cycle and mitotic signaling pathways."
1638,"The main goal of our study was to evaluate the surgical technique, the 
feasibility and patient's satisfaction of multiple surgeries: Risk-reducing 
salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) combined with mastectomy in patients with BRCA 1-2 
mutation carriers. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with BRCA 
1-2 variants who underwent RRSO combined with risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy 
(RRBM) or surgeries for breast cancer from January-2015 to December-2021. We 
collected data about surgeries, complications, and patients' satisfaction using 
a questionnaire submitted 30 days after surgery. We included 54 patients. 
Forty-eight patients underwent RRSO, and six patients underwent RRSO + Total 
laparoscopic hysterectomy (LTH). The minor postoperative complications within 30 
days were four: one breast seromas aspiration (1.9%), one infectious 
reconstructive complication treated with antibiotics therapy (1.9%), one 
Red-Breast-Syndrome (1.9%) and one trocar abdominal hematoma (1.9%) associated 
with RRSO. The major postoperative complications within 30 days were five: two 
evacuations of a breast hematoma (3.7%) and three infectious reconstructive 
complications treated with removal expander/implant (5.6%). No postoperative 
complications after 30 days were observed. According to the satisfaction 
questionnaire, more than 90% of patients were satisfied and would have combined 
surgery again. In conclusion, the multiple surgeries seem feasible and safety 
with a single anesthesia, a single surgical time, a single postoperative 
recovery, and a high patients' satisfactions without increasing morbidity."
1639,"Osteoporosis (OP) is a major global health concern, with aging being one of the 
most important risk factors. Osteoarthritis (OA) is also an age-related 
disorder. Patients with OP and/or OA may be treated surgically for fractures or 
when their quality of life is impaired. Poor bone quality due to OP can 
seriously complicate the stability of a bone fixation construct and/or surgical 
fracture treatment. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the 
pathophysiology of normal and osteoporotic bone healing, the effect of a bone 
fracture on bone turnover markers, the diagnosis of a low bone mineral density 
(BMD) before surgical intervention, and the effect of available 
anti-osteoporosis treatment. Interventions that improve bone health may enhance 
the probability of favorable surgical outcomes. Fracture healing and the 
treatment of atypical femoral fractures are also discussed."
1640,"Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease associated with significant 
morbidity and mortality. In the United States (US), the overall 5-year relative 
survival rate for pancreatic cancer during the 2012-2018 period was 11.5%. 
However, the cancer stage at diagnosis strongly influences relative survival in 
these patients. Per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) statistics for 
2012-2018, the 5-year relative survival rate for patients with localized disease 
was 43.9%, while it was 3.1% for patients with distant metastasis. The poor 
survival rates are primarily due to the late development of clinical signs and 
symptoms. Hence, early diagnosis is critical in improving treatment outcomes. In 
recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained immense popularity in 
gastroenterology. AI-assisted endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) models have been 
touted as a breakthrough in the early detection of pancreatic cancer. These 
models may also accurately differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic 
pancreatitis and autoimmune pancreatitis, which mimics pancreatic cancer on 
radiological imaging. In this review, we detail the application of AI-assisted 
EUS models for pancreatic cancer detection. We also highlight the utility of 
AI-assisted EUS models in differentiating pancreatic cancer from radiological 
mimickers. Furthermore, we discuss the current limitations and future 
applications of AI technology in EUS for pancreatic cancers."
1641,"A radiosynovectomy (RS) should be indicated when recurrent articular bleeds 
related to chronic hemophilia synovitis (CHS) exist, established by clinical 
examination, and confirmed by imaging techniques that cannot be constrained with 
hematological prophylaxis. RS can be performed at any point in life, mainly in 
adolescents (&gt;13-14 years) and adults. Intraarticular injection (IAI) of a 
radioactive material in children might be arduous since we need child 
collaboration which might include general anesthesia. RS is our initial option 
for management of CHS. For the knee joint we prescribe Yttrium-90, while for the 
elbow and ankle we prescribe Rhenium-186 (1 to 3 IAIs every 6 months). The 
procedure is greatly cost efficient when compared to surgical synovectomy. 
Chemical synovectomy with rifampicin has been reported to be efficacious, 
inexpensive, simple, and especially practical in developing countries where 
radioactive materials are not easily available. Rifampicin seems to be more 
efficacious when it is utilized in small joints (elbows and ankles), than when 
utilized in bigger ones (knees). When RS and/or chemical synovectomy fail, 
arthroscopic synovectomy (or open synovectomy in some cases) should be 
indicated. For us, surgery must be performed after the failure of 3 RSs with 
6-month interims. RS is an effective and minimally invasive intervention for 
treatment of repeated articular bleeds due to CHS. Although it has been 
published that the risk of cancer does not increase, and that the amount of 
radioactive material used in RS is insignificant, the issue of chromosomal 
and/or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) changes remains a concern and continued 
surveillance is critical. As child and adulthood prophylaxis becomes more 
global, RS might become obsolete in the long-term."
1642,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the functional outcomes and quality of life 
(QoL) in oncologic patients with intraoral defects reconstructed with the 
buccinator myomucosal flap. A retrospective study was performed involving 39 
patients with intraoral soft-tissue defects, reconstructed with a buccinator 
myomucosal flap during a six-year period. Patients completed the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires, the standard 
questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the head-and-neck specific module (QLQ-H&N35). 
Thirty-nine patients with a mean age of 61.23 ± 15.80 years were included in the 
study. Thirty-three patients were diagnosed with an oncological condition 
(84.61%). Six patients (15.38%) developed orosinusal communication and underwent 
extensive debridement. The median global-health-status score was 79.27 and 
emotional performance was the lowest scoring, with a mean score of 76.93. As for 
the symptom items, the most outstanding were dental problems (33.33), oral 
opening (31.62) and dry mouth (37.61), followed by sticky saliva (24.79), 
problems with social eating (21.15) and pain (19.87). The most significant 
symptoms were radiotherapy-related adverse effects such as pain, fatigue, dental 
problems and dry mouth. Patients reconstructed with the buccinator myomucosal 
flap develop a good quality of life for all types of activities, and a correct 
function and aesthetics. Postoperative radiotherapy is associated with a poorer 
quality of life, and can lead to impairment of several symptoms such as 
swallowing, oral opening and dry mouth."
1643,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms consist of heterogeneous diseases. Depending 
on the novel features detected by various modern technologies, their 
classification and related prognosis predictions continue to change and develop. 
The role of traditional clinicopathological prognostic factors, including 
classification systems, is also being refined, and several attempts have been 
made to predict a more accurate prognosis through novel serum biomarkers, 
genetic factors, and epigenetic factors that have been identified through 
various state-of-the-art molecular techniques with multiomics sequencing. In 
this review article, the latest research results including the traditional 
approach to prognostic factors and recent advanced strategies for risk 
stratification of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms based on clinical, 
pathological, and molecular characteristics are summarized. Predicting prognosis 
through multi-factorial assessments seems to be more efficacious, and prognostic 
factors through noninvasive methods are expected to develop further advances in 
liquid biopsy in the future."
1644,"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most frequently 
prescribed drugs for cancer pain. We used the Delphi methodology to evaluate the 
opinions of clinicians on NSAIDs and paracetamol, with a specific focus on their 
safety profile. Consensus was reached on seven statements. A high level of 
consensus was reached regarding the use of NSAIDs and gastrointestinal, 
cardiovascular, and renal risk in patients taking low-dose aspirin and 
assessment of liver function during long-term treatment with paracetamol. 
Consensus was also reached that assessment and monitoring of eGFR are important 
in the elderly being administered NSAIDs. It was further agreed that NSAIDs can 
often play a key role in association with opioids in the treatment of cancer 
pain and that paracetamol is the analgesic of first choice for patients with 
mild chronic pain. When NSAIDs are administered in combination with steroids, it 
was agreed that the risk of gastrointestinal damage is increased since steroids 
delay the healing of ulcers and that paracetamol can be used during pregnancy 
and does not affect the health of the fetus. This Delphi study highlights that 
there is poor agreement on how these drugs are routinely prescribed. However, a 
consensus was reached for seven key statements and may represent a valid 
contribution to daily practice."
1645,"(1) Background: Ultrasound (US) elastography is an imaging technology that 
reveals tissue stiffness. This study aimed to investigate whether fibrotic focus 
(FF) affects elastographic findings in breast cancer, and to evaluate the 
clinical significance of US elastography and FF in breast cancer. (2) Methods: 
In this study, 151 patients with breast cancer who underwent surgery were 
included. Strain elastography was performed and an elasticity scoring system was 
used to assess the findings. The elasticity scores were classified as negative, 
equivocal, or positive. FF was evaluated in the surgical specimens. Medical 
records were reviewed for all patients. (3) Results: Elastographic findings were 
equivocal in 30 patients (19.9%) and positive in 121 patients (80.1%). FF was 
present in 68 patients (46.9%). There was no correlation between elastographic 
findings and FF. Older age, larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and higher 
tumor stage were associated with positive elastographic results. FF showed a 
positive correlation with age, postmenopausal status, tumor size, lymphovascular 
invasion, lymph node metastasis, tumor stage, and intratumoral and peritumoral 
inflammation. (4) Conclusions: Our study showed that positive elastographic 
results and FF were associated with poor prognostic factors for breast cancer. 
FF did not affect the elastographic findings of this study."
1646,"BACKGROUND: Severe trauma potentially results in end-organ damage such as 
myocardial injury. Data suggest that myocardial injury is associated with 
increased mortality in this cohort, but the association with the incidence of 
in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) remains undetermined.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including adult patients with severe trauma 
treated at the University Hospital Duesseldorf between January 2016 and December 
2019. The main exposure was myocardial injury at presentation. Endpoints were 
in-hospital incidence of MACE and incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) within 
72 h. Discrimination of hsTnT for MACE and AKI was examined by the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC). We 
conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: We included 353 patients in our final analysis (72.5% male (256/353), 
age: 55 ± 21 years). The AUC for hsTnT and MACE was 0.68 [95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.59-0.78]. The AUC for hsTnT and AKI was 0.64 [95% (CI): 
0.55-0.72]. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for myocardial injury and MACE was 2.97 
[95% (CI): 1.31-6.72], and it was 2.14 [95% (CI): 1.03-4.46] for myocardial 
injury and AKI.
CONCLUSION: Myocardial injury at presentation in patients with severe trauma is 
independently associated with the incidence of in-hospital MACE and AKI."
1647,"Muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma represents 20% of newly diagnosed cases of 
bladder cancer, and most cases show aggressive biological behavior with a poor 
prognosis. It is necessary to identify biomarkers that can be used as prognostic 
and predictive factors in daily clinical practice. In our study, we analyzed 
different antibodies in selected cases of muscle-invasive urinary bladder 
carcinoma and lymph node metastasis to identify immunohistochemical types and 
their value as possible prognostic factors. A total of 38 patients were 
included, 87% men and 13% women, with a mean age of 67.8 years. The most 
frequent histopathological type was urothelial carcinoma. In the primary lesion, 
the mixed type was the most common. In unilateral metastasis, the mixed type was 
the most frequently found. In cases of primary lesions and bilateral metastasis, 
the luminal and mixed types were observed. The luminal subtype was the most 
stable in immunohistochemical expression across primary tumors and metastases. 
The basal type showed a better prognosis in terms of disease-free survival. In 
conclusion, immunohistochemical studies are useful in assessing primary and 
metastatic lesions in patients with urothelial carcinoma. Immunohistochemical 
classification can typify muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, and the 
immunophenotype seems to have prognostic implications."
1648,"Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most common complications and 
late causes of death in TBI patients. Targeted prevention and treatment of HAP 
are of great significance for improving the prognosis of TBI patients. In the 
previous clinical observation, we found that folic acid treatment for TBI 
patients has a good effect on preventing and treating HAP. We conducted this 
retrospective cohort study to demonstrate what we observed by selecting 293 TBI 
patients from two medical centers and analyzing their hospitalization data. The 
result showed that the incidence of HAP was significantly lower in TBI patients 
who received folic acid treatment (44.1% vs. 63.0%, p = 0.012). Multivariate 
logistic regression analysis showed that folic acid treatment was an independent 
protective factor for the occurrence of HAP in TBI patients (OR = 0.418, p = 
0.031), especially in high-risk groups of HAP, such as the old (OR: 1.356 vs. 
2.889), ICU (OR: 1.775 vs. 5.996) and severe TBI (OR: 0.975 vs. 5.424) patients. 
At the same time, cohort studies of HAP patients showed that folic acid also had 
a good effect on delaying the progression of HAP, such as reducing the chance of 
tracheotomy (26.1% vs. 50.8%, p = 0.041), and reduced the length of hospital 
stay (15 d vs. 19 d, p = 0.029) and ICU stay (5 d vs. 8 d, p = 0.046). 
Therefore, we believe that folic acid treatment in TBI patients has the 
potential for preventing and treating HAP, and it is worthy of further clinical 
research."
1649,"Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC) is a rare pathological subtype of 
pancreatic cancer (PC), with a worse prognosis than pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Due to its rarity, our knowledge of PASC and its 
biological characteristics are limited. In this review, we provide an overview 
of the histogenesis, genetic features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of 
PASC, as well as pancreatic squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC). The information 
provided here may help to clarify our understanding of PASC and provide useful 
avenues for further research on this disease."
1650,"BACKGROUND: Platelets play a role in venous thromboembolism (VTE) and in 
mediating colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Still, platelets' role in 
hypercoagulability after surgical intervention for metastatic bone disease (MBD) 
is ill-defined.
METHODS: In this quantitative observational study, we utilized a high-resolution 
imaging approach to temporally examine platelet procoagulant membrane dynamics 
(PMD) in four patients with MBD from primary CRC (CRC/MBD), before and after 
surgical intervention, over a 6-month period. We coupled this investigation with 
thrombelastography, quantitative plasma shotgun proteomics, and biochemical 
analysis.
RESULTS: The plasma of CRC/MBD patients was enriched in ADAM1a, ADAMTS7, and 
physiological ligands for platelet glycoprotein-VI/spleen tyrosine kinase 
(GPVI/Syk) activation. Thromboprophylaxis attenuated procoagulation upon its 
initial prescription (post-operative day one, POD1); however, all patients 
experienced rebound procoagulation between POD3 and POD14, which was associated 
with Syk activation (Y525/Y526) in all patients, and a VTE event in two 
patients. Plasma levels of DNA-histone complexes increased steadily after 
surgery and remained elevated throughout the study period. Additionally, we 
increasingly sighted both homotypic and heterotypic platelet microaggregates 
after surgery in CRC/MBD patients, but not in healthy control participants' 
plasma.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data elucidates the cell biology of a prothrombo-inflammatory 
state caused by disease and vascular injury, and recalcitrant to 
thromboprophylaxis. New mechanistic insights into hypercoagulability in CRC/MBD 
patients may identify novel drug targets for effective thromboprophylaxis type 
and duration after orthopaedic surgery."
1651,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between prediagnosis depression, anxiety symptoms, 
and ovarian cancer (OC) survival is unknown. We aimed to explore these 
associations to provide further epidemiological evidence.
METHODS: We investigated the relationship between prediagnosis depression, 
anxiety symptoms, and OC survival in a prospective cohort study of newly 
diagnosed OC patients aged 18-79 years. Depression and anxiety symptoms were 
assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder 7 at diagnosis, respectively. Deaths were ascertained until 31 March 
2021 via medical records and active follow-up. Multivariable-adjusted Cox 
proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) with prediagnosis depression and anxiety symptoms and 
all-cause mortality of OC.
RESULTS: We found 56 (9.4%) and 235 (39.3%) OC patients with depression and 
anxiety symptoms, respectively. During a median follow-up of 37.2 months 
(interquartile range 24.7-50.2 months), 130 deaths were confirmed. Compared with 
non-depression symptoms, patients with prediagnosis depressive symptoms showed a 
significantly increased risk of OC mortality (HR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.20-3.70). Of 
note, the association was still robust when focusing on the OC patients with 
severe depressive symptoms (HR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.07-4.12). However, we observed 
no association between prediagnosis anxiety symptoms of different severity and 
OC mortality. Interestingly, OC patients with combined moderate depression and 
anxiety symptoms had a significantly increased risk of OC mortality (HR = 3.23, 
95% CI: 1.14-9.11) compared to those with no symptoms of depression and anxiety. 
Notably, Wilms's tumor 1 was significantly associated with depression and 
anxiety symptoms (p &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Prediagnosis depression increases the risk of OC mortality. Large 
multicenter studies are required to confirm this finding."
1652,"As patient breathing irregularities can introduce a large uncertainty in 
targeting the internal tumor volume (ITV) of lung cancer patients, and thereby 
affect treatment quality, this study evaluates dose tolerance of tumor motion 
amplitude variations in ITV-based volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). A 
motion-incorporated planning technique was employed to simulate treatment 
delivery of 10 lung cancer patients' clinical VMAT plans using original and 
three scaling-up (by 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 cm) motion waveforms from single-breath 
four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) and multi-breath time-resolved 4D 
magnetic resonance imaging (TR-4DMRI). The planning tumor volume (PTV = ITV + 5 
mm margin) dose coverage (PTV D95%) was evaluated. The repeated waveforms were 
used to move the isocenter in sync with the clinical leaf motion and gantry 
rotation. The continuous VMAT arcs were broken down into many static beam fields 
at the control points (2°-interval) and the composite plan represented the 
motion-incorporated VMAT plan. Eight motion-incorporated plans per patient were 
simulated and the plan with the native 4DCT waveform was used as a control. The 
first (D95% ≤ 95%) and second (D95% ≤ 90%) plan breaching points due to motion 
amplitude increase were identified and analyzed. The PTV D95% in the 
motion-incorporated plans was 99.4 ± 1.0% using 4DCT, closely agreeing with the 
corresponding ITV-based VMAT plan (PTV D95% = 100%). Tumor motion irregularities 
were observed in TR-4DMRI and triggered D95% ≤ 95% in one case. For small 
tumors, 4 mm extra motion triggered D95% ≤ 95%, and 6-8 mm triggered D95% ≤ 90%. 
For large tumors, 14 mm and 21 mm extra motions triggered the first and second 
breaching points, respectively. This study has demonstrated that PTV D95% 
breaching points may occur for small tumors during treatment delivery. 
Clinically, it is important to monitor and avoid systematic motion increase, 
including baseline drift, and large random motion spikes through threshold-based 
beam gating."
1653,"BACKGROUND: The latissimus dorsi myocutaneous (LDMC) flap is a preferred flap in 
breast reconstruction for its wide surface area and volume. Since the flap is 
situated in the midback area, a lateral decubitus approach is a conventional 
method. However, proper visualization and access to the thoracodorsal vascular 
pedicle or muscle insertion is difficult from the lateral approach, causing 
inefficiency and surgeon fatigue. We propose the 'anterior-first' approach in 
LDMC flap reconstruction, where the landmark structures are first approached 
from the supine-anterior position through the mastectomy incision.
METHODS: From January 2014 to December 2020, 48 patients who received immediate 
breast reconstruction with LDMC flap were included in the study. Patients 
received reconstruction with the conventional approach (n = 20), or 
anterior-first approach (n = 28). Demographic factors and the operative outcomes 
were retrospectively analyzed and compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Compared to the conventional approach group, the anterior-first 
approach group showed improved efficiency in the duration of total 
reconstruction (228 versus 330 min, p &lt; 0.001), and flap elevation (139 
versus 200 min, p &lt; 0.001). No difference in complication rate and time to 
drain removal was observed (p = 0.14 and &gt;0.9, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The anterior-first approach for breast reconstruction with LDMC flap 
provides surgeons with an enhanced surgical exposure and superior ergonomics, 
leading to a safer and more efficient flap elevation."
1654,"Despite significant advances in therapeutics for esophageal cancer (ESC) in the 
past decade, it remains the sixth most fatal malignancy, with a poor 5-year 
survival rate (approximately 10%). There is an urgent need to improve the timely 
diagnosis to aid the prediction of the therapeutic response and prognosis of 
patients with ESC. The telomeric G-tail plays an important role in the 
chromosome protection. However, aging and age-related diseases lead to its 
shortening. Therefore, the G-tail length has been proposed as a novel potential 
biomarker. In the present study, to examine the possibility of G-tail shortening 
in patients with ESC, we measured the leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and the 
G-tail length using a hybridization protection assay in 147 patients with ESC 
and 170 age-matched healthy controls. We found that the G-tail length in 
patients with ESC was shorter than that in the healthy controls (p = 0.02), 
while the LTL shortening was not correlated with the ESC incidence and 
recurrence. Our results suggest that the G-tail length reflects the 
physiological status of patients with ESC and is a promising biomarker for the 
diagnosis and prognosis of ESC."
1655,"Chemotherapeutics' development has enhanced the survival rate of cancer 
patients; however, adverse effects of chemotherapeutics on ovarian functions 
cause fertility loss in female cancer patients. Cisplatin (CP), an important 
chemotherapeutic drug for treating solid tumors, has adversely affected ovarian 
function. Melatonin (MT) has been shown to have beneficial effects on ovarian 
function owing to its antioxidative function. In this research, an animal model 
was established to explore the effect of MT on CP-induced ovarian damage. 
Immunohistochemical analysis and Western blot were also used to explore its 
mechanism. This study reported that MT protects mouse ovaries from CP-induced 
damage. Specifically, MT significantly prevented CP-induced ovarian reserve 
decline by maintaining AMH and BMP15 levels. We also found that MT ameliorated 
CP-induced cell cycle disorders by up-regulating CDC2 expression, and inhibited 
CP-induced ovarian inflammation by decreasing IL-1β and IL-18 levels. Moreover, 
MT protected the ovary from CP-induced mitochondrial damage, as reflected by 
restoring mitochondria-related protein expression. Furthermore, CP caused 
ovarian apoptosis, as indicated by up-regulated BAX expression. MT was also 
shown to activate the MAPK pathway. Our results showed that MT could ameliorate 
ovarian damage induced by CP, implying that MT may be a viable alternative to 
preserve female fertility during CP chemotherapy."
1656,"BACKGROUND: Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) represents one of the current 
research hotspots in the field of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The 
aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic value of NAC in patients with 
borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) followed by pancreatectomy with 
portal vein (PV) resection and reconstruction with venous allograft (VAG).
METHODS: Medical records of patients with BPRC who underwent pancreatectomy with 
concomitant PV resection and reconstruction with VAG between April 2013 and 
March 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. Outcomes of patients with and without 
NAC (NAC, Group 1 vs. non-NAC, Group 2) were compared with focus on R0 resection 
rates, morbidity, and survival.
RESULTS: Of the 77 patients with pancreatectomy, PV resection and reconstruction 
with VAG were identified. Overall survival (OS) rates of 0.5-, 1-, and 2-year 
were 80.5%, 59.7%, and 31.2%, respectively (median survival time, MST, 14 
months). Of these, 24 patients (Group 1) underwent operation following received 
NAC, and the remaining 53 patients did not (Group 2). The R0 resection rate of 
vascular margin was 100% vs. 84.9% (p = 0.04), respectively. Morbidity of 
post-operative pancreatic fistula (POPF) was 0% vs. 17.8% (p = 0.07), 
respectively. The OS of 0.5-, 1- and 2-year and MST of 2 groups were 83.3%, 
66.7%, 41.7%, 16 months, and 79.2%, 55.6%, 26.4%, 13 months, respectively. 
Multivariate analysis revealed that carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) serum 
level and postoperative chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors in 
patients with BRPC after surgery.
CONCLUSION: NAC might improve the R0 resection rate and POPF in patients with 
BRPC who underwent pancreatectomy with concomitant PV resection and 
reconstruction with VAG. Survival benefit exists in patients with BRPC who 
received NAC before pancreatectomy. Postoperative chemotherapy also had a 
favorable effect on OS of BRPC patients. Elevated CA 19-9 serum level is 
associated with poor prognosis, even after NAC-combining operation."
1657,"(1) Background: There are no reliable and widely available markers of functional 
iron deficiency (FID) in cancer. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role 
of transferrin (Tf) as a marker of cancer of the ovary (CrO) and related FID. 
(2) Methods: The study groups consisted of 118 patients with CrO and 69 control 
females. Blood serum iron status was determined on a Beckman Coulter AU (USA) 
analyzer. Tf quantification was performed by immunoturbidimetry. The relative 
contents of apo- and holo-Tf (iron-free and iron-saturated Tf, respectively) 
were determined in eight patients and a control female by immunochromatographic 
analysis based on the use of monoclonal single-domain antibodies (nanobodies). 
(3) Results: Four groups of patients with different iron statuses were selected 
according to ferritin and transferrin saturation values: absolute iron 
deficiency (AID) (n = 42), FID (n = 70), iron overload (n = 4), normal iron 
status (n = 2). The groups differed significantly in Tf values (p &lt; 0.0001). 
Lower values of Tf were associated with FID. Furthermore, FID is already found 
in the initial stages of CrO (26%). Immunosorbents based on nanobodies revealed 
the accumulation of apo-Tf and the decrease in holo-Tf in patients with CrO. (4) 
Conclusions: Tf may be a promising tool for diagnosing both CrO and associated 
FID."
1658,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic disorder of the upper 
airway. OSA surgery has oftentimes been researched based on the outcomes of 
single-institutional facilities. We retrospectively analyzed a 
multi-institutional national database to investigate the outcomes of OSA surgery 
and identify risk factors for complications.
METHODS: We reviewed the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality 
Improvement Program (NSQIP) database (2008-2020) to identify patients who 
underwent OSA surgery. The postoperative outcomes of interest included 30-day 
surgical and medical complications, reoperation, readmission, and mortality. 
Additionally, we assessed risk-associated factors for complications, including 
comorbidities and preoperative blood values.
RESULTS: The study population included 4662 patients. Obesity (n = 2909; 63%) 
and hypertension (n = 1435; 31%) were the most frequent comorbidities. While two 
(0.04%) deaths were reported within the 30-day postoperative period, the total 
complication rate was 6.3% (n = 292). Increased BMI (p = 0.01), male sex (p = 
0.03), history of diabetes (p = 0.002), hypertension requiring treatment (p = 
0.03), inpatient setting (p &lt; 0.0001), and American Society of Anesthesiology 
(ASA) physical status classification scores ≥ 4 (p &lt; 0.0001) were identified 
as risk-associated factors for any postoperative complications. Increased 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was identified as a risk-associated factor for the 
occurrence of any complications (p = 0.02) and medical complications (p = 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: OSA surgery outcomes were analyzed at the national level, with 
complications shown to depend on AP levels, male gender, extreme BMI, and 
diabetes mellitus. While OSA surgery has demonstrated an overall positive safety 
profile, the implementation of these novel risk-associated variables into the 
perioperative workflow may further enhance patient care."
1659,"OBJECTIVE: There are limited data for estimating the risk of early discharge 
following thoracoscopic lobectomy. The objective was to identify the factors 
associated with a short length of stay and verify the influence of these 
variables in uncomplicated patients.
METHODS: We reviewed all lobectomies reported to the Italian VATS Group between 
January 2014 and January 2020. Patients and perioperative characteristics were 
divided into two subgroups based on whether or not they met the target duration 
of stay (≤ or &gt;4 days). The association between preoperative and 
intraoperative variables and postoperative length of stay (LOS) ≤4 days was 
assessed using a stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify 
factors independently associated with LOS and factors related to LOS in 
uncomplicated cases.
RESULTS: Among 10,240 cases who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy, 37.6% had a 
hospital stay ≤4 days. Variables associated with LOS included age, hospital 
surgical volume, Diffusion Lung CO % (81 [69-94] vs. 85 [73-98]), Forced 
Expiratory Volume (FEV1) % (92 [79-106] vs. 96 [82-109]), operative time (180 
[141-230] vs. 160 [125-195]), uniportal approach (571 [9%] vs. 713 [18.5%]), 
bioenergy sealer use, and pain control through intercostal block or opioids (p 
&lt; 0.001). Except for FEV1 and blood loss, all other factors emerged 
significantly associated with LOS when the analysis was limited to uncomplicated 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Demographic, clinical, and surgical variables are associated with 
early discharge after thoracoscopic lobectomy. This study indicates that these 
characteristics are associated with early discharge. This result can be used in 
association with clinical judgment to identify appropriate patients for 
fast-track protocols."

1661,"BACKGROUND: Liposarcoma (LPS) is one of the most common soft-tissue sarcomas. 
However, intrathoracic LPS is rare, as only 1% of all LPS cases are found in the 
thorax.
METHODS: A systematic literature review through PubMed and Embase databases was 
performed. Only eligible case reports and case series reporting intrathoracic 
LPS in adult patients were included. Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated to 
evaluate the survival rate of included patients based on the histological 
subtype of LPS.
RESULTS: 123 studies reporting 197 patients were included. We added a case of a 
69-year-old female patient with recurrent giant intrathoracic LPS. The primary 
tumor measured 15.1cm × 22.9 cm × 21.9 cm and weighed 3100 g. Six months later, 
the patient was admitted to the hospital with another intrathoracic tumor 
measuring 9.5 cm × 9 cm× 1.4 cm. The immunohistochemical studies showed 
expression of murine double minute 2 (MDM2) antigen in both primary and 
recurrent tumor cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Dyspnea, chest pain, and cough were the most common symptoms 
reported in included studies. Overall, the 5-year survival rate was 62%. The 
highest survival was observed in well-differentiated LPS patients (80%) and the 
lowest in myxoid LPS (31%)."
1662,"INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is currently the fourth most common cancer in 
women and in the poorest countries this neoplasia still represents a widespread 
and potentially lethal disease. We present a rare case of cervical cancer in 
pregnancy, analyzing the historical changes behind the procedure of radical 
hysterectomy for cervical cancer and discussing variations in surgical 
techniques and anatomical definitions that have since been proposed.
RESULTS: We present the case of a 33-year-old patient who attended with vaginal 
bleeding in the second trimester of pregnancy. Examination revealed an abnormal 
looking cervix, with investigations concluding stage IIb squamous cell 
carcinoma. Following extensive discussion regarding management options, the 
patient went on to have a peripartum foetocidal type III nerve sparing radical 
Wertheim hysterectomy at 18 weeks gestation with conservation and transposition 
of the ovaries above the level of the pelvic brim. The patient recovered well 
without significant morbidity and received further input from fertility and 
psychological medical teams in addition to adjuvant treatment within the 
department of clinical oncology.
DISCUSSION: This case represents several elements of great interest and 
learning. Notably, we highlight this both due to the surgical challenges that a 
gravid uterus presents in the execution of a radical hysterectomy; and regarding 
the compassionate care demonstrated by the team - not only in supporting the 
patient and her partner in a period of profound turmoil in terms of the 
management of their cancer diagnosis and unborn child, but also regarding the 
uncertainty in consideration of the oncological and fertility related outcomes.
CONCLUSION: This manuscript adds to the growing literature on the appropriate 
use of radical surgery for cervical cancer, more specifically during pregnancy 
and in consideration of such ethical dilemma, where management guidelines do not 
exist to aid clinicians further in their provision of treatment."
1663,"Cancer is a leading cause of death in Korea, and depression and suicide are 
major psychiatric problems in cancer patients. This study aimed to explore the 
correlation between anxiety, depression, social support, cancer state, and 
suicidality among urologic cancer patients. Sixty patients with urologic cancer 
were admitted to a university hospital between October 2019 and February 2020. 
The patients were evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, Suicidality module of the Mini 
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), and the Lubben Social Network 
scales (LSNS). To determine which psychological or demographic factors affected 
suicide risk, Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, regression, and 
logistic regression were conducted. It was found that the greater the depressive 
symptoms, the higher the suicidal risk (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.08-1.61). 
Furthermore, anxiety symptoms and the duration of cancer after diagnosis 
significantly increased depressive symptoms (p = 0.032). Clinicians should be 
able to identify the risk factors for suicide in patients with cancer, one of 
which is depression. To assess the risk of suicide, we must evaluate not only 
depressive symptoms but also the related anxiety and duration of the disease. 
Prevention and intervention efforts are needed to improve depressive moods and 
anxiety after cancer diagnosis."
1664,"OBJECTIVE: Current studies focus on the prevalence rate of lung cancer in 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and connective tissue disease-associated 
interstitial lung disease (CTD-LID). Our aim was to investigate the prevalence 
of malignancies in patients with various subtypes of ILD.
METHODS: A total of 5350 patients diagnosed with ILD between January 2015 and 
December 2021 were retrospectively included. The prevalence of different 
malignancies and different ILDs was assessed using complete follow-up data.
RESULTS: A total of 248 patients (139 males; 65-IQR, 57 to 72-years) out of 5350 
patients with ILD were confirmed with malignancies. A total of 69% of patients 
with ILD and malignances were older than 60 years old. The prevalence of 
malignancies in ILD patients was 4.6%, and lung cancer had the most common 
incidence of 1.9%, followed by malignancies in the digestive system of 0.9%. 
Among the different ILD subtypes, the prevalence of malignancies such as 
organizing pneumonia (OP), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), anti-neutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibodies-associated vasculitis-related ILD(AAV-ILD), nonspecific 
interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), CTD-ILD, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), 
sarcoidosis, and other types of ILD was 6.8%, 5.0%, 4.7%, 4.3%, 2.5%, 2.2%, 
1.2%, and 6.9%, respectively. The incidence of lung cancer as the most common 
tumor in IPF was 3.9%, with adenocarcinoma predominating (1.7%). The highest 
rate of malignancy occurring in RA of CTD-ILD was 2.4%.
CONCLUSION: Older patients with ILD (≥60 years) including OP, IPF, AAV-ILD, 
NSIP, CTD-ILD, and HP, were associated with a higher incidence of malignancy, 
especially males aged from 60 to 69 years. These epidemiological results 
indicate that it is essential for physicians to pay more attention to the 
screening of and management strategies for different malignancies, according to 
the specific ILD subtypes."
1665,"Circulating albumin structures, including their oxidized and reduced forms, are 
involved in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) development. However, the effects of 
rifaximin, a key drug in HE treatment, on the circulating albumin structure in 
patients with liver cirrhosis remain unclear. In this multicenter prospective 
study, eight patients with hyperammonemia (≥80 μg/dL) were enrolled. The 
circulating albumin structure was evaluated using the ratio of oxidized albumin 
(human nonmercaptalbumin, HNA). Patients were administered 400 mg rifaximin 3 
times/day for 3 months, and laboratory data were assessed at baseline and during 
observation. Among the eight patients, three were men; the median age and body 
mass index were 70 years and 26.4 kg/m2, respectively. The median HNA and serum 
ammonia levels at baseline were 41% and 143 μg/dL, respectively. After rifaximin 
therapy, HNA showed a decreasing tendency (median; from 41% to 36%, p = 0.321), 
but serum albumin levels showed no significant change (from 3.5 g/dL to 3.5 
g/dL, p = 1.00); serum ammonia levels significantly reduced (median: 143 μg/dL 
to 76 μg/dL, p = 0.015). Thus, rifaximin reduces serum ammonia levels and may 
improve circulating albumin structure in patients with cirrhosis. Further 
large-scale studies are required to confirm these preliminary results."
1666,"Lenvatinib is the standard treatment for radioiodine-refractory differentiated 
thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). Thromboembolic (TE) side effects are quite rare (1-3% 
of treated patients) in clinical trials. Nevertheless, patients with 
predisposing factors are at a higher risk of developing cardiovascular adverse 
events. Reduction of lenvatinib starting dose and cardiologic counselling to 
provide appropriate supportive therapies are usually recommended for high-risk 
patients. From 2016 to 2022, we analyzed a series of 16 patients who were 
consecutively treated at our institution. All except one patient received a 
reduction in their dosage after two cycles of therapy because of toxicities, and 
four patients (25%) suffered from TE. The observed incidence in our patient 
sample seemed to be higher than expected. We hypothesized that our patient 
sample might be at higher risk probably because of the heavy prior loco-regional 
treatments performed."
1667,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest tumours worldwide, and its poor 
prognosis is due to an inability to detect the disease at the early stages, 
thereby creating an urgent need to develop non-invasive biomarkers. 
P-element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI) proteins work together with 
piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to perform epigenetic regulation and as such hold 
great potential as biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. PIWIL2 and PIWIL4 are 
associated with better prognosis, while PIWIL1 and PIWIL3 involvement appears to 
be associated with carcinogenesis. We aimed to discover PIWIL3- and 
PIWIL4-modulated piRNAs and determine their potential mechanisms in pancreatic 
cancer and the clinical implications. PIWIL3 or PIWIL4 was downregulated in 
pancreatic cancer-derived cell lines or in a non-tumour cell line. 
Differentially expressed piRNAs were analysed by next generation sequencing of 
small RNA. Nine fresh-frozen samples from solid human pancreases (three healthy 
pancreases, three intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and three 
early-stage pancreatic cancers) were included in the sequencing analysis. Two 
piRNAs associated with PIWIL3 (piR-168112 and piR-162725) were identified in the 
neoplastic cells; in untransformed samples, we identified one piRNA associated 
with PIWIL4 (pir-366845). After validation in pancreatic cancer-derived cell 
lines and one untransformed pancreatic cell line, these piRNAs were evaluated in 
plasma samples from healthy donors (n = 27) or patients with pancreatic cancer 
(n = 45). Interestingly, piR-162725 expression identified pancreatic cancer 
patients versus healthy donors in liquid biopsies. Moreover, the potential of 
the serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) biomarker to identify pancreatic 
cancer patients was greatly enhanced when combined with piR-162725 detection. 
The enhanced diagnostic potential for the early detection of pancreatic cancer 
in liquid biopsies of these new small non-coding RNAs will likely improve the 
prognosis and management of this deadly cancer."
1668,"Bladder dysfunction is a common complication after chronic spinal cord injury 
(SCI). Patients may experience renal function loss, urinary tract infection 
(UTI), urolithiasis, bladder cancer, and even life-threatening events such as 
severe sepsis or renal failure. Suitable patient care may prevent UTI and 
urinary incontinence, decrease medication use, and preserve renal function. As 
the primary goal is to preserve renal function, management should be focused on 
facilitating bladder drainage, the avoidance of UTI, and the maintenance of a 
low intravesical pressure for continence and complete bladder emptying. 
Currently, several bladder management options are available to SCI patients: (1) 
reflex voiding; (2) clean intermittent catheterization; (3) indwelling 
catheterization. The target organ may be the bladder or the bladder outlet. The 
purposes of intervention include the following: (1) increasing bladder capacity 
and/or decreasing intravesical pressure; (2) increasing bladder outlet 
resistance; (3) decreasing bladder outlet resistance; (4) producing detrusor 
contractility; (5) urinary diversion. Different bladder management methods and 
interventions may have different results depending on the patient's lower 
urinary tract dysfunction. This review aims to report the current management 
options for long-term bladder dysfunction in chronic SCI patients. Furthermore, 
we summarize the most suitable care plans for improving the clinical outcome of 
SCI patients."
1669,"Systemic osteosclerotic lesions are frequently caused by multiple bone 
metastases or systemic metabolic disorders. However, bone metastasis from 
gastric cancer is rare. Herein, we describe such a case, with radiographic and 
clinical findings resembling Paget's disease. The patient was an 80-year-old 
Japanese woman with a history of early gastric cancer, treated by partial 
gastrectomy 2 years prior. The patient sought medical care for chronic low back 
pain. On imaging, systemic sclerotic lesions were observed throughout the spine 
and pelvis, with an increase in bone mineral density from 0.86 g/cm3 (2 years 
prior) to 1.38g/cm3 (current visit) in the lumbar spine. Elevated serum levels 
of osteoblastic and osteolytic markers were identified. A bone biopsy was used 
to confirm the diagnosis of metastatic gastric cancer. The patient was treated 
with TS-1 and denosumab, with normalization of abnormal metabolic markers and 
alleviation of the back pain. Bone metastasis is reported in only 10% of cases 
of gastric cancer and, thus, is relatively rare. Therefore, our case of gastric 
cancer recurrence presenting with mixed osteoblastic and osteolytic bone lesions 
similar to Paget's disease is relevant to the report. Bone biopsy is necessary 
for an accurate diagnosis."
1670,"BACKGROUND: Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a rare but severe necrotizing 
infection causing there to be gas in the pelvicalyceal system, renal parenchyma, 
and perirenal or pararenal space. Physicians should attend to EPN because of its 
life-threatening septic complications. The overall mortality rate has been 
reported to be as high as 20-40%. In addition, most patients had diabetes 
mellitus (DM) and obstructive uropathy. The most common isolated microorganism 
is Escherichia coli. This study aims to analyze the risk factors and performance 
of scoring systems in predicting the clinical outcomes of patients with EPN.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected the data of patients with EPN in this single 
hospital-based retrospective study from the electronic medical records of 
Taichung Veterans General Hospital between January 2007 and December 2020. 
Radiological investigations of abdominal computed tomography (CT) confirmed the 
diagnosis of EPN. In addition, we analyzed demographics, clinical 
characteristics, and laboratory data. Finally, we used various scoring systems 
to predict clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of fifty patients with EPN, whose diagnoses were confirmed 
through CT, were enrolled in the study. There were 18 males (36%) and 32 females 
(64%), with a mean age of 64.3 ± 11.3 years. The in-hospital mortality rate was 
16%. A DM of 34 (68%) patients was the most common comorbidity. Fever was the 
most common symptom, found in 25 (50%) patients. The Mortality in Emergency 
Department Sepsis (MEDS) score was 4.64 ± 3.67 for survivors and 14.25 ± 5.34 
for non-survivors (p &lt; 0.001). The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was 
3.64 ± 2.33 for survivors and 7.13 ± 4.85 for non-survivors (p = 0.046). The 
Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) was 5.81 ± 1.97 for survivors and 9.13 ± 
3.87 for non-survivors (p = 0.024). Regarding performance of mortality risk 
prediction, the AUC of ROC was 0.932 for MEDS, 0.747 for REMS, and 0.72 for 
NEWS.
CONCLUSIONS: MEDS, REMS, and NEWS could be prognostic tools for the prediction 
of the clinical outcomes of patients with EPN. MEDS showed the best sound 
performance. In those with higher scores in MEDS (≥12), REMS (≥10), and NEWS 
(≥8), we recommended aggressive management and appropriate antimicrobial therapy 
as soon as possible to reduce mortality. Further large-scale studies are 
required to gain a deep understanding of this disease and to ensure patient 
safety."
1671,"As our ""hidden organ"", microbes widely co-exist at various sites on the human 
body. These microbes are collectively referred to as the microbiome. A 
considerable number of studies have already proven that the microbiome has 
significant impacts on human health and disease progression, including cancers. 
The recent discovery of cancer-specific microbiomes renders these 
cancer-associated microbes as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. 
While at low biomass levels, the lung microbiome still dramatically influences 
the initiation, progression and treatment of lung cancers. However, research on 
lung cancer-associated microbiomes is emerging, and most profiling studies are 
performed within three years. Unfortunately, there are substantial 
inconsistencies across these studies. Variations in microbial diversity were 
observed, and different microbial biomarkers for lung cancer have been proposed. 
In this review, we summarized the current findings of lung cancer microbiome 
studies and attempt to explain the potential reasons for the dissimilarities. 
Other than lung microbiomes, oral and airway microbiomes are highly related to 
lung microbiomes and are therefore included as well. In addition, several lung 
cancer-associated bacterial genera have been detected by different independent 
studies. These bacterial genera may not be perfect biomarkers, but they still 
serve as promising risk factors for lung cancers and show great prognostic 
value."
1672,"BACKGROUND: Sleep is closely related to various diseases. Several meta-analyses 
have provided evidence of sleep and cancer, and yet the credibility of this 
evidence has not been comprehensively quantified. Thus, we conducted an umbrella 
review to quantify the evidence for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of 
observational studies on sleep characteristics (sleep duration, sleep quality, 
napping, bedtime, and wake-up time) and cancer-related outcomes.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science (Core Collection), and Embase databases were 
searched from inception until 29 July 2022. Assessment of Multiple Systematic 
Reviews, version 1, was used to evaluate the methodological quality of each 
eligible systematic review or meta-analysis. For each association, the summary 
effect with a 95% confidence interval was evaluated by fixed and random effects 
models. The 95% prediction interval, heterogeneity, small-study effects, and 
excess significance bias were also evaluated. Evidence of the associations from 
systematic reviews and meta-analyses was ranked based on the established 
criteria of published literature as convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, 
weak, or non-significant.
RESULTS: The umbrella review identified thirty meta-analyses on the 
aforementioned associations from six articles. The methodological quality of 
five articles was high or moderate. Suggestive evidence was found for 
associations between long sleep duration and a 21% increased risk of colorectal 
cancer, a 9% increased all-cancer mortality and a 65% increased mortality of 
lung cancer, and associations between short sleep duration and a 21% increased 
mortality of lung cancer. Additionally, the evidence of associations between 
short sleep duration and lung cancer mortality was upgraded to convincing, and 
between long sleep duration and lung cancer mortality was upgraded to highly 
suggestive, among the population reporting 24 h sleep duration.
CONCLUSION: Abnormal sleep duration might be linked to several adverse 
cancer-related outcomes."
1673,"Cyanobacterial blooms caused by Cyanobacteria adversely affect the health of the 
people living in their vicinity. We elucidated the effect of Cyanobacteria in 
patients with breast cancer. The serum microbiome of the patients with breast 
cancer was analyzed using NGS. Serologic tests were performed to analyze the 
association between the factors affecting the liver function of patients with 
breast cancer and the amount of Cyanobacteria. In addition, the recurrent-free 
survival of patients with breast cancer according to the abundance of 
Cyanobacteria was analyzed. The abundance of Cyanobacteria tended to be 
correlated with the serological results related to liver function. A high 
abundance of Cyanobacteria seemed to be more related to late-stage breast 
cancer. A high recurrent-free survival was related to a low abundance of 
Cyanobacteria. Even though no toxicity study was conducted, this study 
demonstrates the impact of phylum Cyanobacteria on the prognosis of patients 
with breast cancer. Thus, the abundance of Cyanobacteria in the microbiome can 
help predict the prognosis of patients with breast cancer."
1674,"Head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCCs) represent a diverse group of tumors 
emerging within different mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, nasopharynx, 
oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx. HNSCCs share common clinical risk factors 
and genomic features, including smoking, alcohol, age, male sex, aneuploidy, and 
TP53 mutations. Viral initiating and contributing events are increasingly 
recognized in HNSCCs. While both Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and human papilloma 
virus (HPV) are observed, EBV is more frequently associated with nasopharyngeal 
cancers whereas HPV is associated with oropharyngeal cancers. HNSCCs are 
associated with high tumor mutational burden and loss of tumor suppressor gene 
function, especially in TP53 and X-linked genes. Multiple lines of evidence 
suggest that HNSCCs are subject to immunologic surveillance and immune-induced 
evolutionary pressure that correlate with negative clinical outcomes. This 
review will discuss genomic mechanisms related to immune-mediated pressures and 
propose prognostic and therapeutic implications of detectable immune escape 
mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis and disease progression."
1675,"BACKGROUND: The nuclear factor-κB transcription factors 1 and 2 (NFKB1 and 
NFKB2) are key components of the NF-κB pathway, which responds to inflammatory 
signals. Since the NFKB1/2 factors are activated via different inflammatory 
molecules, we aimed to check their expression levels in penile cancer (PC), 
penile dermatoses: lichen sclerosus (PLS) and zoon balanitis (ZB).
METHODS: Skin biopsies from altered and healthy looking foreskin were obtained 
from 59 (49 LS; early PLS: 13, moderate PLS: 32, severe PLS: 4; 6 PC; 4 ZB) and 
unchanged foreskin from 13 healthy control adult males undergoing circumcision. 
NFKB1/2 mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR.
RESULTS: The highest levels of NFKB1 and NFKB2 were observed in PC, ca. 22 and 
3.5 times higher than in control, respectively. NFKB1 expression was correlated 
with PLS progression (rs = 0.667) and was ca. 20 times higher in advanced PLS 
than in controls and early PLS. Occurrence of micro-incontinence was associated 
with elevated NFKB1 levels in PLS.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study regarding gene profiles of NFKB1/2 in PC and 
penile dermatoses. New drugs targeting modulation of canonical-activated NF-κB 
pathway should be studied and introduced to the treatment of PLS and PC apart 
from other treatments."
1676,"In alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD) and in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD), there are abnormal accumulations of fat in the liver. This phenomenon 
may be related to excessive alcohol consumption, as well as the combination of 
alcohol consumption and medications. There is an evolution from simple steatosis 
to steatohepatitis, fibrosis and cirrhosis leading to hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC). Hepatic pathology is very similar regarding non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD) and ALD. Initially, there is lipid accumulation in parenchyma 
and progression to lobular inflammation. The morphological changes in the liver 
mitochondria, perivenular and perisinusoidal fibrosis, and hepatocellular 
ballooning, apoptosis and necrosis and accumulation of fibrosis may lead to the 
development of cirrhosis and HCC. Medical history of ethanol consumption, 
laboratory markers of chronic ethanol intake, AST/ALT ratio on the one hand and 
features of the metabolic syndrome on the other hand, may help in estimating the 
contribution of alcohol intake and the metabolic syndrome, respectively, to 
liver steatosis."
1677,"Radiation-Induced CardioVascular Disease (RICVD) is an important concern in 
thoracic radiotherapy with complex underlying pathophysiology. Recently, we 
proposed DNA methylation as a possible mechanism contributing to RICVD. The 
current study investigates DNA methylation in heart-irradiated rats and 
radiotherapy-treated breast cancer (BC) patients. Rats received fractionated 
whole heart X-irradiation (0, 0.92, 6.9 and 27.6 Gy total doses) and blood was 
collected after 1.5, 3, 7 and 12 months. Global and gene-specific methylation of 
the samples were evaluated; and gene expression of selected differentially 
methylated regions (DMRs) was validated in rat and BC patient blood. In rats 
receiving an absorbed dose of 27.6 Gy, DNA methylation alterations were detected 
up to 7 months with differential expression of cardiac-relevant DMRs. Of those, 
SLMAP showed increased expression at 1.5 months, which correlated with 
hypomethylation. Furthermore, E2F6 inversely correlated with a decreased global 
longitudinal strain. In BC patients, E2F6 and SLMAP exhibited differential 
expression directly and 6 months after radiotherapy, respectively. This study 
describes a systemic radiation fingerprint at the DNA methylation level, 
elucidating a possible association of DNA methylation to RICVD pathophysiology, 
to be validated in future mechanistic studies."
1678,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-derived vesicles released by a variety 
of cell types, including hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, and immune cells 
in normal and pathological conditions. Depending on their biogenesis, there is a 
complex repertoire of EVs that differ in size and origin. EVs can carry lipids, 
proteins, coding and non-coding RNAs, and mitochondrial DNA causing alterations 
to the recipient cells, functioning as intercellular mediators of cell-cell 
communication (auto-, para-, juxta-, or even endocrine). Nevertheless, many 
questions remain unanswered in relation to the function of EVs under 
physiological and pathological conditions. The development and optimization of 
methods for EV isolation are crucial for characterizing their biological 
functions, as well as their potential as a treatment option in the clinic. In 
this manuscript, we will comprehensively review the results from different 
studies that investigated the role of hepatic EVs during liver diseases, 
including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 
alcoholic liver disease, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In general, the 
identification of patients with early-stage liver disease leads to better 
therapeutic interventions and optimal management. Although more light needs to 
be shed on the mechanisms of EVs, their use for early diagnosis, follow-up, and 
prognosis has come into the focus of research as a high-potential source of 
'liquid biopsies', since they can be found in almost all biological fluids. The 
use of EVs as new targets or nanovectors in drug delivery systems for liver 
disease therapy is also summarized."
1679,"Bexarotene is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell 
lymphoma (CTCL); however, its use provokes or disrupts other retinoid-X-receptor 
(RXR)-dependent nuclear receptor pathways and thereby incites side effects 
including hypothyroidism and raised triglycerides. Two novel bexarotene analogs, 
as well as three unique CD3254 analogs and thirteen novel NEt-TMN analogs, were 
synthesized and characterized for their ability to induce RXR agonism in 
comparison to bexarotene (1). Several analogs in all three groups possessed an 
isochroman ring substitution for the bexarotene aliphatic group. Analogs were 
modeled for RXR binding affinity, and EC50 as well as IC50 values were 
established for all analogs in a KMT2A-MLLT3 leukemia cell line. All analogs 
were assessed for liver-X-receptor (LXR) activity in an LXRE system to gauge the 
potential for the compounds to provoke raised triglycerides by increasing LXR 
activity, as well as to drive LXRE-mediated transcription of brain ApoE 
expression as a marker for potential therapeutic use in neurodegenerative 
disorders. Preliminary results suggest these compounds display a broad spectrum 
of off-target activities. However, many of the novel compounds were observed to 
be more potent than 1. While some RXR agonists cross-signal the retinoic acid 
receptor (RAR), many of the rexinoids in this work displayed reduced RAR 
activity. The isochroman group did not appear to substantially reduce RXR 
activity on its own. The results of this study reveal that modifying potent, 
selective rexinoids like bexarotene, CD3254, and NEt-TMN can provide rexinoids 
with increased RXR selectivity, decreased potential for cross-signaling, and 
improved anti-proliferative characteristics in leukemia models compared to 1."
1680,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related 
mortality worldwide. The AKT pathway is often activated in HCC cases, and a 
longer exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib may lead to 
over-activation of the AKT pathway, leading to HCC resistance. Here, we studied 
the efficacy of a new generation of allosteric AKT inhibitor, vevorisertib, 
alone or in combination with sorafenib. To identify specific adverse effects 
related to the background of cirrhosis, we used a diethylnitrosamine 
(DEN)-induced cirrhotic rat model. Vevorisertib was tested in vitro on Hep3B, 
HepG2, HuH7 and PLC/PRF cell lines. Rats were treated weekly with 
intra-peritoneal injections of DEN for 14 weeks to obtain cirrhosis with fully 
developed HCC. After that, rats were randomized into four groups (n = 7/group): 
control, sorafenib, vevorisertib and the combination of vevorisertib + 
sorafenib, and treated for 6 weeks. Tumor progression was followed by MRI. We 
demonstrated that the vevorisertib is a highly potent treatment, blocking the 
phosphorylation of AKT. The tumor progression in the rat liver was significantly 
reduced by treatment with vevorisertib + sorafenib (49.4%) compared to the 
control group (158.8%, p &lt; 0.0001). Tumor size, tumor number and tumor cell 
proliferation were significantly reduced in both the vevorisertib group and 
vevorisertib + sorafenib groups compared to the control group. Sirius red 
staining showed an improvement in liver fibrosis by vevorisertib and the 
combination treatment. Moreover, vevorisertib + sorafenib treatment was 
associated with a normalization in the liver vasculature. Altogether, 
vevorisertib as a single agent and its combination with sorafenib exerted a 
strong suppression of tumor progression and improved liver fibrosis. Thus, 
results provide a rationale for testing vevorisertib in clinical settings and 
confirm the importance of targeting AKT in HCC."
1681,"Dysmenorrhoea effects up to 90% of women of reproductive age, with medical 
management options including over-the-counter analgesia or hormonal 
contraception. There has been a recent surge in medicinal cannabis research and 
its analgesic properties. This paper aims to critically investigate the current 
research of medicinal cannabis for pain relief and to discuss its potential 
application to treat dysmenorrhoea. Relevant keywords, including medicinal 
cannabis, pain, cannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabinol, dysmenorrhoea, and clinical 
trial, have been searched in the PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, 
Cochrane Library (Wiley) databases and a clinical trial website 
(clinicaltrials.gov). To identify the relevant studies for this paper, 84 papers 
were reviewed and 20 were discarded as irrelevant. This review critically 
evaluated cannabis-based medicines and their mechanism and properties in 
relation to pain relief. It also tabulated all clinical trials carried out 
investigating medicinal cannabis for pain relief and highlighted the side 
effects. In addition, the safety and toxicology of medicinal cannabis and 
barriers to use are highlighted. Two-thirds of the clinical trials summarised 
confirmed positive analgesic outcomes, with major side effects reported as 
nausea, drowsiness, and dry mouth. In conclusion, medicinal cannabis has 
promising applications in the management of dysmenorrhoea. The global medical 
cannabis market size was valued at USD 11.0 billion in 2021 and is expected to 
expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.06% from 2022 to 2030. This 
will encourage academic as well as the pharmaceutical and medical device 
industries to study the application of medical cannabis in unmet clinical 
disorders."
1682,"The liver is the most common metastatic site in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
patients. Indeed, 25-30% of the cases develop colorectal liver metastasis (CLM), 
showing an extremely poor 5-year survival rate and resistance to conventional 
anticancer therapies. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) provide a nurturing 
microenvironment for CRC metastasis, promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) through the TGF-β signaling pathway, thus driving tumor cells 
to acquire mesenchymal properties that allow them to migrate from the primary 
tumor and invade the new metastatic site. EMT is known to contribute to the 
disruption of blood vessel integrity and the generation of circulating tumor 
cells (CTCs), thus being closely related to high metastatic potential in 
numerous solid cancers. Despite the fact that it is well-recognized that the 
crosstalk between tumor cells and the inflammatory microenvironment is crucial 
in the EMT process, the association between the EMT and the role of TAMs is 
still poorly understood. In this review, we elaborated on the role that TAMs 
exert in the induction of EMT during CLM development. Since TAMs are the major 
source of TGF-β in the liver, we also focused on novel insights into their role 
in TGF-β-induced EMT."
1683,"In the last decade, new tumor entities have been described, including 
EWSR1/FUS::NFATC2-rearranged neoplasms of different biologic behavior. To gain 
further insights into the behavior of these tumors, we analyzed a spectrum of 
EWSR1/FUS::NFATC2-rearranged neoplasms and discuss their key diagnostic and 
molecular features in relation to their prognosis. We report five patients with 
EWSR1/FUS::NFATC2-rearranged neoplasms, including one simple bone cyst (SBC), 
two complex cystic bone lesions lacking morphological characteristics of SBC, 
and two sarcomas. In three cases, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 
in all cases copy number variation (CNV) profiling and fusion analyses were 
performed. All patients were male, three cystic lesions occurred in children 
(aged 10, 14, and 17 years), and two sarcomas in adults (69 and 39 years). 
Fusion analysis revealed two FUS::NFATC2 rearrangements in two cystic lesions 
and three EWSR1::NFATC2 rearrangements in one complex cystic lesion and two 
sarcomas. EWSR1 FISH revealed tumor cells with break-apart signal without 
amplification in one complex cystic lesion and EWSR1 amplification in both 
sarcomas was documented. CNV analysis showed simple karyotypes in all cystic 
lesions, while more complex karyotypes were found in NFATC2-rearranged sarcomas. 
Our study supports and expands previously reported molecular findings of 
EWSR1/FUS::NFATC2-rearranged neoplasms. The study highlights the importance of 
combining radiology and morphologic features with molecular aberrations. The use 
of additional molecular methods, such as CNV and FISH in the routine diagnostic 
workup, can be crucial in providing a correct diagnosis and avoiding 
overtreatment."
1684,"The loss of apicobasal polarity during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) is a hallmark of cancer and metastasis. The key feature of this polarity 
in epithelial cells is the subdivision of the plasma membrane into apical and 
basolateral domains, with each orchestrating specific intra- and extracellular 
functions. Epithelial transport and signaling capacities are thought to be 
determined largely by the quality, quantity, and nanoscale organization of 
proteins residing in these membrane domains, the apicobasal surfaceomes. Despite 
its implications for cancer, drug uptake, and infection, our current knowledge 
of how the polarized surfaceome is organized and maintained is limited. Here, we 
used chemoproteomic surfaceome scanning to establish proteotype maps of 
apicobasal surfaceomes and reveal quantitative distributions of, i.e., surface 
proteases, phosphatases, and tetraspanins as potential key regulators of 
polarized cell functionality. We show further that the tumor suppressor PTEN 
regulates polarized surfaceome architecture and uncover a potential role in 
collective cell migration. Our differential surfaceome analysis provides a 
molecular framework to elucidate polarized protein networks regulating 
epithelial functions and PTEN-associated cancer progression."
1685,"Biomaterials for tissue scaffolds are key components in modern tissue 
engineering and regenerative medicine. Targeted reconstructive therapies require 
a proper choice of biomaterial and an adequate choice of cells to be seeded on 
it. The introduction of stem cells, and the transdifferentiation procedures, 
into regenerative medicine opened a new era and created new challenges for 
modern biomaterials. They must not only fulfill the mechanical functions of a 
scaffold for implanted cells and represent the expected mechanical strength of 
the artificial tissue, but furthermore, they should also assure their survival 
and, if possible, affect their desired way of differentiation. This paper aims 
to review how modern biomaterials, including synthetic (i.e., polylactic acid, 
polyurethane, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene terephthalate, ceramics) and 
natural (i.e., silk fibroin, decellularized scaffolds), both non-biodegradable 
and biodegradable, could influence (tissue) stem cells fate, regulate and direct 
their differentiation into desired target somatic cells."
1686,"The need for bone substitutes is a major challenge as the incidence of serious 
bone disorders is massively increasing, mainly attributed to modern world 
problems, such as obesity, aging of the global population, and cancer incidence. 
Bone cancer represents one of the most significant causes of bone defects, with 
reserved prognosis regarding the effectiveness of treatments and survival rate. 
Modern therapies, such as hyperthermia, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and 
magnetic therapy, seem to bring hope for cancer treatment in general, and bone 
cancer in particular. Mimicking the composition of bone to create advanced 
scaffolds, such as bone substitutes, proved to be insufficient for successful 
bone regeneration, and a special attention should be given to control the 
changes in the bone tissue micro-environment. The magnetic manipulation by an 
external field can be a promising technique to control this micro-environment, 
and to sustain the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts, promoting 
the expression of some growth factors, and, finally, accelerating new bone 
formation. By incorporating stimuli responsive nanocarriers in the scaffold's 
architecture, such as magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with bioactive 
molecules, their behavior can be rigorously controlled under external magnetic 
driving, and stimulates the bone tissue formation."
1687,"Owing to its high recurrence rate, gastric cancer (GC) is the leading cause of 
tumor-related deaths worldwide. Besides surgical treatment, chemotherapy is the 
most commonly used treatment against GC. However, the adverse events associated 
with chemotherapy use limit its effectiveness in GC treatment. In this study, we 
investigated the effects of using combinations of low-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 
0.001 and 0.01 mM) with different concentrations of escitalopram oxalate (0.01, 
0.02, 0.06, and 0.2 mM) to evaluate whether the assessed combination would have 
synergistic effects on SNU-1 cell survival. 5-FU (0.01 mM) + escitalopram 
oxalate (0.02 mM) and 5-FU (0.01 mM) + escitalopram oxalate (0.06 mM) 
administered over 24 h showed synergistic effects on the inhibition of SNU-1 
cell proliferation. Moreover, 5-FU (0.001 mM) + escitalopram oxalate (0.02 or 
0.06 mM) and 5-FU (0.01 mM) + escitalopram oxalate (0.02, 0.06, or 0.2 mM) 
administered over 48 h showed synergistic effects on the inhibition of SNU-1 
cell proliferation. Compared with controls, SNU-1 cells treated with 5-FU (0.01 
mM) + escitalopram oxalate (0.02 mM) exhibited significantly increased levels of 
annexin V staining, reactive oxygen species, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) 
polymerase, and caspase-3 proteins. Furthermore, 5-FU (12 mg/kg) + escitalopram 
oxalate (12.5 mg/kg) significantly attenuated xenograft SNU-1 cell proliferation 
in nude mice. Our study is the first to report the synergistic effects of the 
combinational use of low-dose 5-FU and escitalopram oxalate on inhibiting SNU-1 
cell proliferation. These findings may be indicative of an alternative option 
for GC treatment."
1688,"ω-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been found to exert many actions, 
including neuroprotective effects. In this regard, the exact molecular 
mechanisms are not well understood. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most 
common age-related neurodegenerative disease. Emerging evidence supports the 
hypothesis that PD is the result of complex interactions between genetic 
abnormalities, environmental toxins, mitochondrial dysfunction, and other 
cellular processes, such as DNA methylation. In this context, BDNF 
(brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and GDNF (glial cell line-derived 
neurotrophic factor) have a pivotal role because they are both involved in 
neuron differentiation, survival, and synaptogenesis. In this study, we aimed to 
elucidate the potential role of two PUFAs, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and their effects on BDNF and GDNF expression in the 
SH-SY5Y cell line. Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay, and flow 
cytometry analysis was used to verify the level of apoptosis. Transmission 
electron microscopy was performed to observe the cell ultrastructure and 
mitochondria morphology. BDNF and GDNF protein levels and mRNA were assayed by 
Western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively. Finally, methylated and 
hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation were performed in the BDNF and GDNF 
promoter regions. EPA, but not DHA, is able (i) to reduce the neurotoxic effect 
of neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in vitro, (ii) to re-establish 
mitochondrial function, and (iii) to increase BNDF and GDNF expression via 
epigenetic mechanisms."
1689,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are targeted therapies that 
inhibit PARP proteins which are involved in a variety of cell functions. PARPi 
may act as modulators of angiogenesis; however, the relationship between PARPi 
and the vasculogenic mimicry (VM) in breast cancer remains unclear. To determine 
whether PARPi regulate the vascular channel formation, we assessed whether the 
treatment with olaparib, talazoparib and veliparib inhibits the vascular channel 
formation by breast cancer cell lines. Here, we found that PARPi act as potent 
inhibitors of the VM formation in triple negative breast cancer cells, 
independently of the BRCA status. Mechanistically, we find that PARPi trigger 
and inhibit the NF-κB signaling, leading to the inhibition of the VM. We further 
show that PARPi decrease the expression of the angiogenic factor PTX3. Moreover, 
PTX3 rescued the PARPi-inhibited VM inhibition. In conclusion, our results 
indicate that PARPi, by targeting the VM, may provide a new therapeutic approach 
for triple negative breast cancer."
1690,"Therapy of FLT3-positive acute myeloid leukemia still remains complicated, 
despite the availability of newly approved kinase inhibitors. Various strategies 
to avoid the reduced efficacy of therapy have been explored, including the 
development of dual targeting compounds, which inhibit FLT3 and another kinase 
necessary for the survival and proliferation of AML cells. We have designed new 
2,7,9-trisubstituted 8-oxopurines as FLT3 inhibitors and report here the 
structure-activity relationship studies. We demonstrated that substituents at 
positions 7 and 9 modulate activity between CDK4 and FLT3 kinase, and the 
isopropyl group at position 7 substantially increased the selectivity toward 
FLT3 kinase, which led to the discovery of compound 15a 
(9-cyclopentyl-7-isopropyl-2-((4-(piperazin-1-yl)phenyl)amino)-7,9-dihydro-8H-purin-8-one). 
Cellular analyses in MV4-11 cells revealed inhibition of autophosphorylation of 
FLT3 kinase in nanomolar doses, including the suppression of downstream STAT5 
and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We also describe mechanistic studies in cell lines 
and activity in a mouse xenograft model in vivo."
1691,"Endoplasmic reticulum stress activates inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) and 
protein kinase, R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), the two principal 
regulators of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In multiple myeloma, adaptive 
IRE1α signaling is predominantly activated and regulates cell fate along with 
PERK. Recently, we demonstrated that GNF-2, an allosteric c-Abl inhibitor, 
rheostatically enhanced IRE1α activity and induced apoptosis through c-Abl 
conformational changes in pancreatic β cells. Herein, we analyzed whether the 
pharmacological modulation of c-Abl conformation resulted in anti-myeloma 
effects. First, we investigated the effects of GNF-2 on IRE1α activity and cell 
fate, followed by an investigation of the anti-myeloma effects of asciminib, a 
new allosteric c-Abl inhibitor. Finally, we performed RNA sequencing to 
characterize the signaling profiles of asciminib. We observed that both GNF-2 
and asciminib decreased cell viability and induced XBP1 mRNA splicing in primary 
human myeloma cells and myeloma cell lines. RNA sequencing identified the 
induction of UPR- and apoptosis-related genes by asciminib. Asciminib 
re-localized c-Abl to the endoplasmic reticulum, and its combination with a 
specific IRE1α inhibitor, KIRA8, enhanced cell death with the reciprocal 
induction of CHOP mRNA expression. Together, the allosteric inhibition of 
c-Abl-activated UPR with anti-myeloma effects; this could be a novel therapeutic 
target for multiple myeloma."
1692,"TRPM8 is a non-selective cation channel expressed in primary sensory neurons and 
other tissues, including the prostate and urothelium. Its participation in 
different physiological and pathological processes such as thermoregulation, 
pain, itch, inflammation and cancer has been widely described, making it a 
promising target for therapeutic approaches. The detection and quantification of 
TRPM8 seems crucial for advancing the knowledge of the mechanisms underlying its 
role in these pathophysiological conditions. Antibody-based techniques are 
commonly used for protein detection and quantification, although their 
performance with many ion channels, including TRPM8, is suboptimal. Thus, the 
search for reliable antibodies is of utmost importance. In this study, we 
characterized the performance of six TRPM8 commercial antibodies in three 
immunodetection techniques: Western blot, immunocytochemistry and 
immunohistochemistry. Different outcomes were obtained for the tested 
antibodies; two of them proved to be successful in detecting TRPM8 in the three 
approaches while, in the conditions tested, the other four were acceptable only 
for specific techniques. Considering our results, we offer some insight into the 
usefulness of these antibodies for the detection of TRPM8 depending on the 
methodology of choice."
1693,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a malignancy that is becoming increasingly common in 
adolescents. OS stem cells (OSCs) form a dynamic subset of OS cells that are 
responsible for malignant progression and chemoradiotherapy resistance. The 
unique properties of OSCs, including self-renewal, multilineage differentiation 
and metastatic potential, 149 depend closely on their tumor microenvironment. In 
recent years, the likelihood of its dynamic plasticity has been extensively 
studied. Importantly, the tumor microenvironment appears to act as the main 
regulatory component of OS cell plasticity. For these reasons aforementioned, 
novel strategies for OS treatment focusing on modulating OS cell plasticity and 
the possibility of modulating the composition of the tumor microenvironment are 
currently being explored. In this paper, we review recent studies describing the 
phenomenon of OSCs and factors known to influence phenotypic plasticity. The 
microenvironment, which can regulate OSC plasticity, has great potential for 
clinical exploitation and provides different perspectives for drug and treatment 
design for OS."
1694,"The care of systemic amyloidosis has improved dramatically due to improved 
awareness, accurate diagnostic tools, the development of powerful prognostic and 
companion biomarkers, and a continuous flow of innovative drugs, which 
translated into the blooming of phase 2/3 interventional studies for light chain 
(AL) and transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. The unprecedented availability of 
effective drugs ignited great interest across various medical specialties, 
particularly among cardiologists who are now recognizing cardiac amyloidosis at 
an extraordinary pace. In all amyloidosis referral centers, we are observing a 
substantial increase in the prevalence of wild-type transthyretin (ATTRwt) 
cardiomyopathy, which is now becoming the most common form of cardiac 
amyloidosis. This review focuses on the oral drugs that have been recently 
introduced for the treatment of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, for their ease of use 
in the clinic. They include both old repurposed drugs or fit-for-purpose 
designed compounds which bind and stabilize the TTR tetramer, thus reducing the 
formation of new amyloid fibrils, such as tafamidis, diflunisal, and acoramidis, 
as well as fibril disruptors which have the potential to promote the clearance 
of amyloid deposits, such as doxycycline. The development of novel therapies is 
based on the advances in the understanding of the molecular events underlying 
amyloid cardiomyopathy."
1695,"Ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a key downstream effector of the mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mTOR), regulates diverse functions, such as cell 
proliferation, cell growth, and protein synthesis. Because S6K1 was previously 
known to be localized in the cytoplasm, its function has been mainly studied in 
the cytoplasm. However, the nuclear localization and function of S6K1 have 
recently been elucidated and other nuclear functions are expected to exist but 
remain elusive. Here, we show a novel nuclear role of S6K1 in regulating the 
expression of the Wnt target genes. Upon activation of the Wnt signaling, S6K1 
translocated from the cytosol into the nucleus and subsequently bound to 
β-catenin and the cofactors of the Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional complex, 
leading to the upregulation of the Wnt target genes. The depletion or repression 
of S6K1 downregulated the Wnt target gene expression by inhibiting the formation 
of the Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional complex. The S6K1-depleted colon cancer 
cell lines showed lower transcription levels of the Wnt/β-catenin target genes 
and a decrease in the cell proliferation and invasion compared to the control 
cell lines. Taken together, these results indicate that nuclear S6K1 positively 
regulates the expression of the Wnt target genes by inducing the reciprocal 
interaction of the subunits of the transcriptional complex."
1696,"Phellinus baumii, a fungus that grows on mulberry trees and is used in 
traditional Chinese medicine, exerts therapeutic effects against various 
diseases, including cancer. Polyphenols, generally considered to be 
antioxidants, have antitumor and proapoptotic effects. In this study, we 
identified the composition of Phellinus baumii polyphenol (PBP) and 
characterized its 17 chemical components by UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS. Furthermore, to 
clarify the potential mechanism of PBP against Lung Cancer Cells, network 
pharmacology and experimental verification were combined. Molecular docking 
elucidated the binding conformation and mechanism of the primary active 
components (Osmundacetone and hispidin) to the core targets CASP3, PARP1 and 
TP53. In addition, potential molecular mechanisms of PBP predicted by network 
pharmacology analysis were validated in vitro. PBP significantly inhibited the 
human lung cancer A549 cells and showed typical apoptotic characteristics, 
without significant cytotoxicity to normal human embryonic kidney (HEK293) 
cells. Analysis using flow cytometry and western blot indicated that PBP caused 
apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and 
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depression in A549 cells to exercise its 
antitumor effects. These results reveal that PBP has great potential for use as 
an active ingredient for antitumor therapy."
1697,"BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia has long been considered an important complication 
of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which severely limits the effectiveness of 
cancer treatment and the overall survival of patients. However, clinical 
treatment options are extremely limited so far. Ruxolitinib is a potential 
candidate.
METHODS: The impact of ruxolitinib on the differentiation and maturation of K562 
and Meg-01 cells megakaryocytes (MKs) was examined by flow cytometry, Giemsa and 
Phalloidin staining. A mouse model of radiation-injured thrombocytopenia (RIT) 
was employed to evaluate the action of ruxolitinib on thrombocytopoiesis. 
Network pharmacology, molecular docking, drug affinity responsive target 
stability assay (DARTS), RNA sequencing, protein blotting and immunofluorescence 
analysis were applied to explore the targets and mechanisms of action of 
ruxolitinib.
RESULTS: Ruxolitinib can stimulate MK differentiation and maturation in a 
dose-dependent manner and accelerates recovery of MKs and thrombocytopoiesis in 
RIT mice. Biological targeting analysis showed that ruxolitinib binds directly 
to Toll Like Receptor 2 (TLR2) to activate Rac1/cdc42/JNK, and this action was 
shown to be blocked by C29, a specific inhibitor of TLR2.
CONCLUSIONS: Ruxolitinib was first identified to facilitate MK differentiation 
and thrombocytopoiesis, which may alleviate RIT. The potential mechanism of 
ruxolitinib was to promote MK differentiation via activating the Rac1/cdc42/JNK 
pathway through binding to TLR2."
1698,"Leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor 1 (LAIR1, CD305) belongs 
to the family of immune-inhibitory receptors and is widely expressed on 
hematopoietic mature cells, particularly on immune cells. Four different types 
of ligands of LAIR1 have been described, including collagens, suggesting a 
potential immune-regulatory function on the extracellular matrix. By modulating 
cytokine secretion and cellular functions, LAIR1 displays distinct patterns of 
expression among NK cell and T/B lymphocyte subsets during their differentiation 
and cellular activation and plays a major negative immunoregulatory role. Beyond 
its implications in physiology, the activity of LAIR1 can be inappropriately 
involved in various autoimmune or inflammatory disorders and has been implicated 
in cancer physiopathology, including hematological neoplasms. Its action as an 
inhibitory receptor can result in the dysregulation of immune cellular responses 
and in immune escape within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, when 
expressed by tumor cells, LAIR1 can modulate their proliferation or invasion 
properties, with contradictory pro- or anti-tumoral effects depending on tumor 
type. In this review, we will focus on its role in normal physiological 
conditions, as well as during pathological situations, including hematological 
malignancies. We will also discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting 
LAIR1 for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases and cancer settings."
1699,"Targeted therapies with antiangiogenic drugs (e.g., sunitinib) and immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-1 antibodies) are the standard of care for 
patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Although these treatments improve 
patient survival, they are rarely curative. We previously hypothesized that 
advanced cancers might be treated without drugs by using artificial diets in 
which the levels of specific amino acids (AAs) are manipulated. In this work, 
after showing that AA manipulation induces selective anticancer activity in 
renal cell carcinoma cells in vitro, we screened 18 artificial diets for 
anticancer activity in a challenging animal model of renal cell carcinoma. The 
model was established by injecting murine renal cell carcinoma (Renca) cells 
into the peritoneum of immunocompetent BALB/cAnNRj mice. Mice survival was 
markedly improved when their normal diet was replaced with our artificial diets. 
Mice fed a diet lacking six AAs (diet T2) lived longer than mice treated with 
sunitinib or anti-PD-1 immunotherapy; several animals lived very long or were 
cured. Controlling the levels of several AAs (e.g., cysteine, methionine, and 
leucine) and lipids was important for the anticancer activity of the diets. 
Additional studies are needed to further evaluate the therapeutic potential and 
mechanism of action of this simple and inexpensive anticancer strategy."
1700,"Cysteine-cysteine chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) has been discovered as a 
co-receptor for cellular entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Moreover, 
the role of CCR5 in a variety of cancers and various inflammatory responses was 
also discovered. Despite the fact that several CCR5 antagonists have been 
investigated in clinical trials, only Maraviroc has been licensed for use in the 
treatment of HIV patients. This indicates that there is a need for novel CCR5 
antagonists. Keeping this in mind, the present study was designed. The active 
CCR5 inhibitors with known IC50 value were selected from the literature and 
utilized to develop a ligand-based common feature pharmacophore model. The 
validated pharmacophore model was further used for virtual screening of 
drug-like databases obtained from the Asinex, Specs, InterBioScreen, and Eximed 
chemical libraries. Utilizing computational methods such as molecular docking 
studies, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free energy calculation, 
the binding mechanism of selected inhibitors was established. The identified 
Hits not only showed better binding energy when compared to Maraviroc, but also 
formed stable interactions with the key residues and showed stable behavior 
throughout the 100 ns MD simulation. Our findings suggest that Hit1 and Hit2 may 
be potential candidates for CCR5 inhibition, and, therefore, can be considered 
for further CCR5 inhibition programs."
1701,"Niclosamide is an FDA-approved anthelmintic drug for the treatment of parasitic 
infections. However, over the past few years, increasing evidence has shown that 
niclosamide could treat diseases beyond parasitic diseases, which include 
metabolic diseases, immune system diseases, bacterial and viral infections, 
asthma, arterial constriction, myopia, and cancer. Therefore, we systematically 
reviewed the pharmacological activities and therapeutic prospects of niclosamide 
in human disease and cancer and summarized the related molecular mechanisms and 
signaling pathways, indicating that niclosamide is a promising therapeutic 
player in various human diseases, including cancer."
1702,"Emerging evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs), which represent a 
crucial mode of intercellular communication, play important roles in cancer 
progression by transferring oncogenic materials. Nickel (Ni) has been identified 
as a human group I carcinogen; however, the underlying mechanisms governing 
Ni-induced carcinogenesis are still being elucidated. Here, we present data 
demonstrating that Ni exposure generates EVs that contribute to Ni-mediated 
carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) 
cells and human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK293) cells were chronically exposed to 
Ni to generate Ni-treated cells (Ni-6W), Ni-transformed BEAS-2B cells (Ni-3) and 
Ni-transformed HEK293 cells (HNi-4). The signatures of EVs isolated from Ni-6W, 
Ni-3, HNi-4, BEAS-2B, and HEK293 were analyzed. Compared to their respective 
untreated cells, Ni-6W, Ni-3, and HNi-4 released more EVs. This change in EV 
release coincided with increased transcription of the EV biogenesis markers 
CD82, CD63, and flotillin-1 (FLOT). Additionally, EVs from Ni-transformed cells 
had enriched protein and RNA, a phenotype also observed in other studies 
characterizing EVs from cancer cells. Interestingly, both epithelial cells and 
human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells showed a preference for taking up 
Ni-altered EVs compared to EVs released from the untreated cells. Moreover, 
these Ni-altered EVs induced inflammatory responses in both epithelial and 
endothelial cells and increased the expression of coagulation markers in 
endothelial cells. Prolonged treatment of Ni-alerted EVs for two weeks induced 
the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BEAS-2B cells. This study is 
the first to characterize the effect of Ni on EVs and suggests the potential 
role of EVs in Ni-induced cancer progression."
1703,"Gastrointestinal disease is prevalent and broad, manifesting itself in a variety 
of ways, including inflammation, fibrosis, infection, and cancer. However, 
historically, diagnostic technologies have exhibited limitations, especially 
with regard to diagnostic uncertainty. Despite development of newly emerging 
technologies such as optoacoustic imaging, many recent advancements have focused 
on improving upon pre-existing modalities such as ultrasound, computed 
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopy. These advancements 
include utilization of machine learning models, biomarkers, new technological 
applications such as diffusion weighted imaging, and new techniques such as 
transrectal ultrasound. This review discusses assessment of disease processes 
using imaging strategies for the detection and monitoring of inflammation, 
fibrosis, and cancer in the context of gastrointestinal disease. Specifically, 
we include ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, celiac disease, 
graft vs. host disease, intestinal fibrosis, colorectal stricture, gastric 
cancer, and colorectal cancer. We address some of the most recent and promising 
advancements for improvement of gastrointestinal imaging, including unique 
discussions of such advancements with regard to imaging of fibrosis and 
differentiation between similar disease processes."
1704,"Active surveillance (AS) is the best strategy for small renal masses (SRMs) 
management; however, reliable methods for early detection and disease 
aggressiveness prediction are urgently needed. The aim of the present study was 
to validate DNA methylation biomarkers for non-invasive SRM detection and 
prognosis. The levels of methylated genes TFAP2B, TAC1, PCDH8, ZNF677, FLRT2, 
and FBN2 were evaluated in 165 serial urine samples prospectively collected from 
39 patients diagnosed with SRM, specifically renal cell carcinoma (RCC), before 
and during the AS via quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain 
reaction. Voided urine samples from 92 asymptomatic volunteers were used as the 
control. Significantly higher methylated TFAP2B, TAC1, PCDH8, ZNF677, and FLRT2 
levels and/or frequencies were detected in SRM patients' urine samples as 
compared to the control. The highest diagnostic power (AUC = 0.74) was observed 
for the four biomarkers panel with 92% sensitivity and 52% specificity. 
Methylated PCDH8 level positively correlated with SRM size at diagnosis, while 
TFAP2B had the opposite effect and was related to SRM progression. To sum up, 
SRMs contribute significantly to the amount of methylated DNA detectable in 
urine, which might be used for very early RCC detection. Moreover, PCDH8 and 
TFAP2B methylation have the potential to be prognostic biomarkers for SRMs."
1705,"Cancer accounts for one in seven deaths worldwide and is the second leading 
cause of death in the United States, after heart disease. One of the standard 
cancer treatments is chemotherapy which sometimes can lead to chemoresistance 
and treatment failure. Therefore, there is a great need for novel therapeutic 
approaches to treat these patients. Novel natural products have exhibited 
anticancer effects that may be beneficial in treating many kinds of cancer, 
having fewer side effects, low toxicity, and affordability. Numerous marine 
natural compounds have been found to inhibit molecular events and signaling 
pathways associated with various stages of cancer development. Fucoxanthin is a 
well-known marine carotenoid of the xanthophyll family with bioactive compounds. 
It is profusely found in brown seaweeds, providing more than 10% of the total 
creation of natural carotenoids. Fucoxanthin is found in edible brown seaweed 
macroalgae such as Undaria pinnatifida, Laminaria japonica, and Eisenia 
bicyclis. Many of fucoxanthin's pharmacological properties include antioxidant, 
anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, antiobesity, anticancer, and antihypertensive 
effects. Fucoxanthin inhibits many cancer cell lines' proliferation, 
angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and metastasis. In addition, it modulates 
miRNA and induces cell cycle growth arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy. Moreover, 
the literature shows fucoxanthin's ability to inhibit cytokines and growth 
factors such as TNF-α and VEGF, which stimulates the activation of downstream 
signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt autophagy, and pathways of apoptosis. This 
review highlights the different critical mechanisms by which fucoxanthin 
inhibits diverse cancer types, such as breast, prostate, gastric, lung, and 
bladder development and progression. Moreover, this article reviews the existing 
literature and provides critical supportive evidence for fucoxanthin's possible 
therapeutic use in cancer."
1706,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer incidence worldwide and among the 
five leading causes of cancer mortality. Despite major improvements in early 
detection and new treatment approaches, the need for better outcomes and quality 
of life for patients is still high. Extracellular vesicles play an important 
role in tumor biology, as they are able to transfer information between cells of 
different origins and locations. Their potential value as biomarkers or for 
targeted tumor therapy is apparent. In this study, we analyzed the supernatants 
of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which were harvested following 5 or 10 days of 
simulated microgravity on a Random Positioning Machine (RPM). The primary 
results showed a substantial increase in released vesicles following incubation 
under simulated microgravity at both time points. The distribution of 
subpopulations regarding their surface protein expression is also altered; the 
minimal changes between the time points hint at an early adaption. This is the 
first step in gaining further insight into the mechanisms of tumor progression, 
metastasis, the education of the tumor microenvironments, and preparation of the 
metastatic niche. Additionally, this may lighten up the processes of the rapid 
cellular adaptions in the organisms of space travelers during spaceflights."
1707,"Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation and recycling process involved in tumor 
progression and drug resistance. The aim of this work was to inhibit autophagy 
and increase apoptosis in a 3D model of human colorectal cancer by combined 
treatment with our patented natural product Prunus spinosa + nutraceutical 
activator complex (PsT + NAC®) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). By means of cytotoxic 
evaluation (MTT assay), cytofluorimetric analysis, light and fluorescence 
microscopy investigation and Western blotting evaluation of the molecular 
pathway PI3/AKT/mTOR, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, Beclin1, p62 and LC3, we 
demonstrated that the combination PsT + NAC® and 5-FU significantly reduces 
autophagy by increasing the apoptotic phenomenon. These results demonstrate the 
importance of using non-toxic natural compounds to improve the therapeutic 
efficacy and reduce the side effects induced by conventional drugs in human 
colon cancer."
1708,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast 
cancer in women. It has the poorest prognosis along with limited therapeutic 
options. Smart nano-based carriers are emerging as promising approaches in 
treating TNBC due to their favourable characteristics such as specifically 
delivering different cargos to cancer cells. However, nanoparticles' tumour cell 
uptake, and subsequent drug release, are essential factors considered during the 
drug development process. Contemporary qualitative analyses based on imaging are 
cumbersome and prone to human biases. Deep learning-based algorithms have been 
well-established in various healthcare settings with promising scope in drug 
discovery and development. In this study, the performance of five different 
convolutional neural network models was evaluated. In this research, we 
investigated two sequential models from scratch and three pre-trained models, 
VGG16, ResNet50, and Inception V3. These models were trained using confocal 
images of nanoparticle-treated cells loaded with a fluorescent anticancer agent. 
Comparative and cross-validation analyses were further conducted across all 
models to obtain more meaningful results. Our models showed high accuracy in 
predicting either high or low drug uptake and release into TNBC cells, 
indicating great translational potential into practice to aid in determining 
cellular uptake at the early stages of drug development in any area of research."
1709,"The striking clinical outcomes of antibody-based immunotherapy, through the 
inhibitors of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and the 
programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) axis, have driven 
research aimed at identifying further clinically relevant tumor antigens that 
can serve as targets in solid tumors. B7 homolog 3 protein (B7-H3, also known as 
CD276) is a member of the B7 family overexpressed in tumor tissues, including 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while showing limited expression in normal 
tissues, becoming an attractive and promising target for cancer immunotherapy. 
B7-H3 expression in tumors has been demonstrated to be associated with poor 
prognosis. In addition to its role in immune modulation, B7-H3 also promotes 
pro-tumorigenic functions such as tumor migration, invasion, metastases, 
resistance, and metabolism. In this review, we will provide an overview of this 
newly characterized immune checkpoint molecule and its development in the 
management of metastatic NSCLC."
1710,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal 
hematopoietic stem cell disorders with maturation and differentiation defects 
exhibiting morphological dysplasia in one or more hematopoietic cell lineages. 
They are associated with peripheral blood cytopenias and by increased risk for 
progression into acute myelogenous leukemia. Among their multifactorial 
pathogenesis, age-related epigenetic instability and the error-rate DNA 
methylation maintenance have been recognized as critical factors for both the 
initial steps of their pathogenesis and for disease progression. Although 
lower-risk MDS is associated with an inflammatory bone marrow microenvironment, 
higher-risk disease is delineated by immunosuppression and clonal expansion. 
""Epigenetics"" is a multidimensional level of gene regulation that determines the 
specific gene networks expressed in tissues under physiological conditions and 
guides appropriate chromatin rearrangements upon influence of environmental 
stimulation. Regulation of this level consists of biochemical modifications in 
amino acid residues of the histone proteins' N-terminal tails and their 
concomitant effects on chromatin structure, DNA methylation patterns in CpG 
dinucleotides and the tissue-specific non-coding RNAs repertoire, which are 
directed against various gene targets. The role of epigenetic modifications is 
widely recognized as pivotal both in gene expression control and differential 
molecular response to drug therapies in humans. Insights to the potential of 
synergistic cooperations of epigenetic mechanisms provide new avenues for 
treatment development to comfort human diseases with a known epigenetic shift, 
such as MDS. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs), such as epigenetic modulating drugs, 
have been widely used in the past years as first line treatment for elderly 
higher-risk MDS patients; however, just half of them respond to therapy and are 
benefited. Rational outcome predictors following epigenetic therapy in MDS and 
biomarkers associated with disease relapse are of high importance to improve our 
efforts in developing patient-tailored clinical approaches."
1711,"Fusion among different cell populations represents a rare process that is 
mediated by both intrinsic and extracellular events. Cellular hybrid formation 
is relayed by orchestrating tightly regulated signaling pathways that can 
involve both normal and neoplastic cells. Certain important cell merger 
processes are often required during distinct organismal and tissue development, 
including placenta and skeletal muscle. In a neoplastic environment, however, 
cancer cell fusion can generate new cancer hybrid cells. Following survival 
during a subsequent post-hybrid selection process (PHSP), the new cancer hybrid 
cells express different tumorigenic properties. These can include elevated 
proliferative capacity, increased metastatic potential, resistance to certain 
therapeutic compounds, and formation of cancer stem-like cells, all of which 
characterize significantly enhanced tumor plasticity. However, many parts within 
this multi-step cascade are still poorly understood. Aside from intrinsic 
factors, cell fusion is particularly affected by extracellular conditions, 
including an inflammatory microenvironment, viruses, pH and ionic stress, 
hypoxia, and exosome signaling. Accordingly, the present review article will 
primarily highlight the influence of extracellular events that contribute to 
cell fusion in normal and tumorigenic tissues."
1712,"Cell migration is an essential part of the complex and multistep process that is 
the development of cancer, a disease that is the second most common cause of 
death in humans. An important factor promoting the migration of cancer cells is 
TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that, among its many biological functions, 
also plays a major role in mediating the expression of MMP9, one of the key 
regulators of cancer cell migration. It is also known that TNF-α is able to 
induce the Warburg effect in some cells by increasing glucose uptake and 
enhancing the expression and activity of lactate dehydrogenase subunit A (LDHA). 
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the interrelationship 
between the TNF-α-induced promigratory activity of cancer cells and their 
glucose metabolism status, using esophageal cancer cells as an example. By 
inhibiting LDHA activity with sodium oxamate (SO, also known as aminooxoacetic 
acid sodium salt or oxamic acid sodium salt) or siRNA-mediated gene silencing, 
we found using wound healing assay and gelatin zymography that LDHA 
downregulation impairs TNF-α-dependent tumor cell migration and significantly 
reduces TNF-α-induced MMP9 expression. These effects were associated with 
disturbances in the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, as we observed 
by Western blotting. We also reveal that in esophageal cancer cells, SO 
effectively reduces the production of lactic acid, which, as we have shown, 
synergizes the stimulating effect of TNF-α on MMP9 expression. In conclusion, 
our findings identified LDHA as a regulator of TNF-α-induced cell migration in 
esophageal cancer cells by the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, suggesting that LDHA 
inhibitors that limit the migration of cancer cells caused by the inflammatory 
process may be considered as an adjunct to standard therapy in esophageal cancer 
patients."
1713,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is recognized as a metabolic disease 
characterized by hepatic steatosis. Despite the growing burden of NAFLD, 
approved pharmacological treatment is lacking. As an inhibitor of androgen 
receptor (AR), EPI-001 is being explored for the treatment of prostate cancer. 
This study aimed to investigate the potential of EPI-001 for treating NAFLD in 
free fatty acids (FFAs)-induced human hepatic cells and high-fat-high-sugar 
(HFHS)-feeding mice. Our results showed that EPI-001 reduced lipid accumulation 
in hepatic cells and ameliorated hepatic steatosis in mouse livers. Further 
exploration suggested that the effect of EPI-001 was associated with 
CYP2E1-mediated reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This provides 
encouraging evidence for further studies on EPI-001 therapy for NAFLD."
1714,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived structures surrounded by a lipid 
bilayer that carry RNA and DNA as potential templates for molecular diagnostics, 
e.g., in cancer genotyping. While it has been established that DNA templates 
appear on the outside of EVs, no consensus exists on which nucleic acid species 
inside small EVs (&lt;200 nm, sEVs) are sufficiently abundant and accessible for 
developing genotyping protocols. We investigated this by extracting total 
intravesicular nucleic acid content from sEVs isolated from the conditioned cell 
medium of the human NCI-H1975 cell line containing the epidermal growth factor 
(EGFR) gene mutation T790M as a model system for non-small cell lung cancer. We 
observed that mainly short genomic DNA (&lt;35-100 bp) present in the sEVs 
served as a template. Using qEV size exclusion chromatography (SEC), 
significantly lower yield and higher purity of isolated sEV fractions were 
obtained as compared to exoEasy membrane affinity purification and 
ultracentrifugation. Nevertheless, we detected the EGFR T790M mutation in the 
sEVs' lumen with similar sensitivity using digital PCR. When applying SEC-based 
sEV separation prior to cell-free DNA extraction on spiked human plasma samples, 
we found significantly higher mutant allele frequencies as compared to standard 
cell-free DNA extraction, which in part was due to co-purification of 
circulating tumor DNA. We conclude that intravesicular genomic DNA can be 
exploited next to ctDNA to enhance EGFR T790M mutation detection sensitivity by 
adding a fast and easy-to-use sEV separation method, such as SEC, upstream of 
standard clinical cell-free DNA workflows."
1715,"Primary breast angiosarcoma, with de novo appearance and not associated with 
exposure to radiation or lymphedema, is a rare pathology representing less than 
0.05% of the neoplasms related to this organ. The pathology is characterized by 
its aggressiveness, poor prognosis, and difficulties in its differential 
diagnosis. This article reports the case of a 55-year-old white woman with no 
family history of cancer, with a rapidly growing mass in the left mammary gland 
that ulcerates and bleeds. It is confirmed as primary breast angiosarcoma by 
immunostaining in the tumor tissue for CD31, CD34, and FLI-1. In addition, a 
sample of neoplastic and healthy tissues is collected from the patient for RNA 
sequencing; the results are contrasted with a tissue sample from a patient with 
Luminal A subtype of breast cancer, as well as data from other cases of 
angiosarcoma available in public databases. These findings revealed a genetic 
profile associated with the immune and inflammatory response in the patient's 
sample when compared to available angiosarcoma data; these molecular patterns 
are consistent with other recent studies. Due to the rarity of the disease, the 
studies carried out on each patient contribute to the expanding knowledge of the 
etiology and molecular pathways that are still partially known and continue to 
be the subject of research. Aside from a comparative transcriptome study, this 
article aims to provide an update on the state of knowledge about this disease."
1716,"Prostate cancer is a major public health concern and one of the most prevalent 
forms of cancer worldwide. The definition of altered signaling pathways 
implicated in this complex disease is thus essential. In this context, abnormal 
expression of the receptor of Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor-1 (M-CSF or 
CSF-1) has been described in prostate cancer cells. Yet, outcomes of this 
expression remain unknown. Using mouse and human prostate cancer cell lines, 
this study has investigated the functionality of the wild-type CSF-1 receptor in 
prostate tumor cells and identified molecular mechanisms underlying its 
ligand-induced activation. Here, we showed that upon CSF-1 binding, the receptor 
autophosphorylates and activates multiple signaling pathways in prostate tumor 
cells. Biological experiments demonstrated that the CSF-1R/CSF-1 axis conferred 
significant advantages in cell growth and cell invasion in vitro. Mouse 
xenograft experiments showed that CSF-1R expression promoted the aggressiveness 
of prostate tumor cells. In particular, we demonstrated that the 
ligand-activated CSF-1R increased the expression of spp1 transcript encoding for 
osteopontin, a key player in cancer development and metastasis. Therefore, this 
study highlights that the CSF-1 receptor is fully functional in a prostate 
cancer cell and may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of 
prostate cancer."
1717,"The metabolism and apoptosis of tumor cells are important factors that increase 
their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. p53 and cisplatin not only induce 
tumor cell apoptosis, but also regulate the tumor cell metabolism. The 
TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) can inhibit glycolysis 
and promote more glucose metabolism in the pentose phosphate pathway. We 
speculate that the regulation of the TIGAR by the combination therapy of p53 and 
cisplatin plays an important role in increasing the sensitivity of tumor cells 
to cisplatin. In this study, we found that the combined treatment of p53 and 
cisplatin was able to inhibit the mitochondrial function, promote mitochondrial 
pathway-induced apoptosis, and increase the sensitivity. Furthermore, the 
expression of the TIGAR was inhibited after a combined p53 and cisplatin 
treatment, the features of the TIGAR that regulate the pentose phosphate pathway 
were inhibited, the glucose flux shifted towards glycolysis, and the 
localization of the complex of the TIGAR and Hexokinase 2 (HK2) on the 
mitochondria was also reduced. Therefore, the combined treatment of p53 and 
cisplatin may modulate a glycolytic flux through the TIGAR, altering the 
cellular metabolic patterns while increasing apoptosis. Taken together, our 
findings reveal that the TIGAR may serve as a potential therapeutic target to 
increase the sensitivity of lung cancer A549 cells to cisplatin."
1718,"ATM germline pathogenic variants were recently found enriched in high-risk 
melanoma patients. However, ATM loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has never been 
investigated in melanoma and, therefore, a causal association with melanoma 
development has not been established yet. The purpose of this study was to 
functionally characterize 13 germline ATM variants found in high-risk melanoma 
patients-and classified by in silico tools as pathogenic, uncertain 
significance, or benign-using multiple assays evaluating ATM/pATM expression 
and/or LOH in melanoma tissues and cell lines. We assessed ATM status by 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western Blot, Whole-Exome Sequencing/Copy Number 
Variation analysis, and RNA sequencing, supported by Sanger sequencing and 
microsatellite analyses. For most variants, IHC results matched those obtained 
with in silico classification and LOH analysis. Two pathogenic variants 
(p.Ser1135_Lys1192del and p.Ser1993ArgfsTer23) showed LOH and complete loss of 
ATM activation in melanoma. Two variants of unknown significance (p.Asn358Ile 
and p.Asn796His) showed reduced expression and LOH, suggestive of a deleterious 
effect. This study, showing a classic two-hit scenario in a well-known tumor 
suppressor gene, supports the inclusion of melanoma in the ATM-related cancer 
spectrum."
1719,"In recent years, many studies have highlighted the possible close correlation 
between human diseases and definite patterns of microbial organisms colonizing 
various organs. Even at sites traditionally considered sterile, such as the 
upper female reproductive tract (FRT), it is now well-recognized as hosting a 
low biomass of different bacterial phyla. Additionally, the data from recent 
studies highlight a possible link between lower and upper FRT dysbiosis with a 
potential predisposition to cervical and ovarian cancer. Acinetobacter, 
chlamydia, increased mycoplasma, and lactobacillary scarcity in the upper FRT 
have all been linked to a predisposition to ovarian cancer. Additionally, a 
high-diversity vaginal community state type (CST) is linked to the presence and 
persistence of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), resulting in decreased 
cellular p53 activity and a reduction in the immune activity of T lymphocytes, 
resulting in cervical and ovarian cancer predisposition. While these findings 
are still far from being clarified in all aspects, in patients with multiple 
risk factors for ovarian cancer, a Lactobacillus crispatus treatment with a 
product with a proven ability to restore a favorable CST should be considered as 
an add-on therapy."
1720,"Endometrial cancer (EC) incidence and mortality continues to rise. Molecular 
profiling of EC promises improvement of risk assessment and treatment selection. 
However, we still lack robust and accurate models to predict those at risk of 
failing treatment. The objective of this pilot study is to create models with 
clinical and genomic data that will discriminate patients with EC at risk of 
disease recurrence. We performed a pilot, retrospective, case-control study 
evaluating patients with EC, endometrioid type: 7 with recurrence of disease 
(cases), and 55 without (controls). RNA was extracted from frozen specimens and 
sequenced (RNAseq). Genomic features from RNAseq included transcriptome 
expression, genomic, and structural variation. Feature selection for variable 
reduction was performed with univariate ANOVA with cross-validation. Selected 
variables, informative for EC recurrence, were introduced in multivariate lasso 
regression models. Validation of models was performed in machine-learning 
platforms (ML) and independent datasets (TCGA). The best performing prediction 
models (out of &gt;170) contained the same lncRNA features (AUC of 0.9, and 95% 
CI: 0.75, 1.0). Models were validated with excellent performance in ML platforms 
and good performance in an independent dataset. Prediction models of EC 
recurrence containing lncRNA features have better performance than models with 
clinical data alone."
1721,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a frequent aortic disease. If the diameter of 
the aorta is larger than 5 cm, an open surgical repair (OSR) or an endovascular 
aortic repair (EVAR) are recommended. To prevent possible complications (i.e., 
endoleaks), EVAR-treated patients need to be monitored for 5 years following the 
intervention, using computed tomography angiography (CTA). However, this 
radiological method involves high radiation exposure in terms of CTA/year. In 
such a context, the study of peripheral-blood-circulating extracellular vesicles 
(pbcEVs) has great potential to identify biomarkers for EVAR complications. We 
analyzed several phenotypes of pbcEVs using polychromatic flow cytometry in 22 
patients with AAA eligible for EVAR. From each enrolled patient, peripheral 
blood samples were collected at AAA diagnosis, and after 1, 6, and 12 months 
following EVAR implantation, i.e. during the diagnostic follow-up protocol. 
Patients developing an endoleak displayed a significant decrease in 
activated-platelet-derived EVs between the baseline condition and 6 months after 
EVAR intervention. Furthermore, we also observed, that 1 month after EVAR 
implantation, patients developing an endoleak showed higher concentrations of 
activated-endothelial-derived EVs than patients who did not develop one, 
suggesting their great potential as a noninvasive and specific biomarker for 
early identification of EVAR complications."
1722,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is usually diagnosed late due to its nonspecific symptoms 
and lack of reliable tools for early diagnostics and screening. OC studies 
concentrate on the search for new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This study 
aimed to validate the MFAP5 gene, and its encoded protein, as a potential 
prognostic biomarker. In our previous study, we found that patients with 
high-grade serous OC who had higher MFAP5 mRNA levels had shorter survival, as 
compared with those with lower levels. Here, we used the Kaplan-Meier Plotter 
and CSIOVDB online tools to analyze possible associations of MFAP5 expression 
with survival and other clinico-pathological features. In these analyses, higher 
MFAP5 mRNA expression was observed in the more advanced FIGO stages and 
high-grade tumors, and was significantly associated with shorter overall and 
progression-free survival. Next, we analyzed the expression of the MFAP5 protein 
by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 108 OC samples and tissue arrays. Stronger 
MFAP5 expression was associated with stronger desmoplastic reaction and serous 
vs. non-serous histology. We found no significant correlation between IHC 
results and survival, although there was a trend toward shorter survival in 
patients with the highest IHC scores. We searched for co-expressed 
genes/proteins using cBioPortal and analyzed potential MFAP5 interaction 
networks with the STRING tool. MFAP5 was shown to interact with many 
extracellular matrix proteins, and was connected to the Notch signaling pathway. 
Therefore, although not suitable as a prognostic biomarker for evaluation with a 
simple diagnostic tool like IHC, MFAP5 is worth further studies as a possible 
therapeutic target."
1723,"Alkanes are widespread in the ocean, and Alcanivorax is one of the most 
ubiquitous alkane-degrading bacteria in the marine ecosystem. Small RNAs (sRNAs) 
are usually at the heart of regulatory pathways, but sRNA-mediated alkane 
metabolic adaptability still remains largely unknown due to the difficulties of 
identification. Here, differential RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) modified with a 
size selection (~50-nt to 500-nt) strategy was used to generate high-resolution 
sRNAs profiling in the model species Alcanivorax dieselolei B-5 under alkane 
(n-hexadecane) and non-alkane (acetate) conditions. As a result, we identified 
549 sRNA candidates at single-nucleotide resolution of 5'-ends, 63.4% of which 
are with transcription start sites (TSSs), and 36.6% of which are with 
processing sites (PSSs) at the 5'-ends. These sRNAs originate from almost any 
location in the genome, regardless of intragenic (65.8%), antisense (20.6%) and 
intergenic (6.2%) regions, and RNase E may function in the maturation of sRNAs. 
Most sRNAs locally distribute across the 15 reference genomes of Alcanivorax, 
and only 7.5% of sRNAs are broadly conserved in this genus. Expression responses 
to the alkane of several core conserved sRNAs, including 6S RNA, M1 RNA and 
tmRNA, indicate that they may participate in alkane metabolisms and result in 
more actively global transcription, RNA processing and stresses mitigation. Two 
novel CsrA-related sRNAs are identified, which may be involved in the 
translational activation of alkane metabolism-related genes by sequestering the 
global repressor CsrA. The relationships of sRNAs with the characterized genes 
of alkane sensing (ompS), chemotaxis (mcp, cheR, cheW2), transporting (ompT1, 
ompT2, ompT3) and hydroxylation (alkB1, alkB2, almA) were created based on the 
genome-wide predicted sRNA-mRNA interactions. Overall, the sRNA landscape lays 
the ground for uncovering cryptic regulations in critical marine bacterium, 
among which both the core and species-specific sRNAs are implicated in the 
alkane adaptive metabolisms."
1724,"The cysteine protease legumain (also known as asparaginyl endopeptidase or 
δ-secretase) is the only known mammalian asparaginyl endopeptidase and is 
primarily localized to the endolysosomal system, although it is also found 
extracellularly as a secreted protein. Legumain is involved in the regulation of 
diverse biological processes and tissue homeostasis, and in the pathogenesis of 
various malignant and nonmalignant diseases. In addition to its proteolytic 
activity that leads to the degradation or activation of different substrates, 
legumain has also been shown to have a nonproteolytic ligase function. This 
review summarizes the current knowledge about legumain functions in health and 
disease, including kidney homeostasis, hematopoietic homeostasis, bone 
remodeling, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, fibrosis, aging and 
senescence, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In addition, this review 
addresses the effects of some marketed drugs on legumain. Expanding our 
knowledge on legumain will delineate the importance of this enzyme in regulating 
physiological processes and disease conditions."
1725,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies and ranks 
third among cancer-related deaths worldwide. Using matrine as a lead compound, 
12 matrine derivatives were designed and synthesised, and their 
antiproliferative activities were evaluated in four cancer cell lines. Eight of 
the twelve compounds showed strong antiproliferative activity, with an IC50 of 
&lt;10 μM. The compound ZS17 exhibited strong antiproliferative activity in 
hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with IC50 values in the range of 3.014-3.388 
μM, which was much lower than that of matrine. Furthermore, we explored the role 
of ZS17 in inducing apoptosis in HCC cells in vitro and in vivo, as well as 
possible mechanisms involved. ZS17 inhibited the proliferation of BEL-7402 and 
HepG2 cells in time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, we found that ZS17 
significantly induced apoptosis and ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, 
promoted JNK phosphorylation, activated p53, and activated the caspase 
signalling pathway. Furthermore, the antioxidant NAC, JNK inhibitor SP600125, 
and Si-JNK increased cell viability, re-established cell metastasis, and 
inhibited ZS17-induced apoptosis. An in vivo antitumour assay demonstrated that 
ZS17 significantly reduced the number of migrating HepG2 cells in zebrafish 
embryos and suppressed the growth of HepG2 xenografts in nude mice without any 
obvious side effects. Our study demonstrated that the ROS-JNK-P53 pathway plays 
an important role in the destruction of liver tumour cells by ZS17. Thus, ZS17 
may represent a promising chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of HCC 
patients."
1726,"Nucleolar stress response is caused by perturbations in ribosome biogenesis, 
induced by the inhibition of ribosomal RNA processing and synthesis, as well as 
ribosome assembly. This response induces p53 stabilization and activation via 
ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11), suppressing tumor progression. However, 
anticancer agents that kill cells via this mechanism, and their relationship 
with the therapeutic efficiency of these agents, remain largely unknown. Here, 
we sought to investigate whether topoisomerase inhibitors can induce nucleolar 
stress response as they reportedly block ribosomal RNA transcription. Using 
rhabdomyosarcoma and rhabdoid tumor cell lines that are sensitive to the 
nucleolar stress response, we evaluated whether nucleolar stress response is 
associated with sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors ellipticine, 
doxorubicin, etoposide, topotecan, and anthracyclines. Cell proliferation assay 
indicated that small interfering RNA-mediated RPL11 depletion resulted in 
decreased sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Furthermore, the expression 
of p53 and its downstream target proteins via western blotting showed the 
suppression of p53 pathway activation upon RPL11 knockdown. These results 
suggest that the sensitivity of cancer cells to topoisomerase inhibitors is 
regulated by RPL11-mediated nucleolar stress responses. Thus, RPL11 expression 
may contribute to the prediction of the therapeutic efficacy of topoisomerase 
inhibitors and increase their therapeutic effect of topoisomerase inhibitors."
1727,"The spread of tumor cells throughout the body by traveling through the 
bloodstream is a critical step in metastasis, which continues to be the main 
cause of cancer-related death. The detection and analysis of circulating tumor 
cells (CTCs) is important for understanding the biology of metastasis and the 
development of antimetastatic therapy. However, the isolation of CTCs is 
challenging due to their high heterogeneity and low representation in the 
bloodstream. Different isolation methods have been suggested, but most of them 
lead to CTC damage. However, viable CTCs are an effective source for developing 
preclinical models to perform drug screening and model the metastatic cascade. 
In this review, we summarize the available literature on methods for isolating 
viable CTCs based on different properties of cells. Particular attention is paid 
to the importance of in vitro and in vivo models obtained from CTCs. Finally, we 
emphasize the current limitations in CTC isolation and suggest potential 
solutions to overcome them."
1728,"Breast cancer is among the most common cancers in women, second to skin cancer. 
Mammary gland development can influence breast cancer development in later life. 
Processes such as proliferation, invasion, and migration during mammary gland 
development can often mirror processes found in breast cancer. MicroRNAs 
(miRNAs), small, non-coding RNAs, can repress post-transcriptional RNA 
expression and can regulate up to 80% of all genes. Expression of miRNAs play a 
key role in mammary gland development, and aberrant expression can initiate or 
promote breast cancer. Here, we review the role of miRNAs in mammary development 
and breast cancer, and potential parallel roles. A total of 32 miRNAs were found 
to be expressed in both mammary gland development and breast cancer. These 
miRNAs are involved in proliferation, metastasis, invasion, and apoptosis in 
both processes. Some miRNAs were found to have contradictory roles, possibly due 
to their ability to target many genes at once. Investigation of miRNAs and their 
role in mammary gland development may inform about their role in breast cancer. 
In particular, by studying miRNA in development, mechanisms and potential 
targets for breast cancer treatment may be elucidated."
1729,"Inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAFs) are closely related to 
progression, anticancer therapeutic resistance, and poor prognosis of bladder 
cancer (BCa). However, the functional role of iCAFs in BCa has been poorly 
studied. In our study, two BCa scRNA-seq datasets (GSE130001 and GSE146137) were 
obtained and integrated by the Seurat pipeline. Based on reported markers 
(COL1A1 and PDGFRA), iCAFs were identified and the related signature of 278 
markers was developed. Following unsupervised consensus clustering, two 
molecular subtypes of TCGA-BLCA were identified and characterized by distinct 
dysregulated cancer hallmarks, immunological tumor microenvironments, prognoses, 
responses to chemotherapy/immunotherapy, and stemness. Subsequently, the 
robustness of the signature-based clustering, in terms of prognosis and 
therapeutic response prediction, was validated in a GEO-meta cohort with seven 
independent GEO datasets of 519 BCa patients, and three immune checkpoint 
inhibitor (ICI)-treated cohorts. Considering the heterogeneity, re-clustering of 
iCAFs was performed and a subpopulation, named ""LOXL2+ iCAFs"", was identified. 
Co-culture CM derived from LOXL2 overexpression/silencing CAFs with T24 cells 
revealed that overexpression of LOXL2 in CAFs promoted while silencing LOXL2 
inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of T24 cells through IL32. 
Moreover, the positive correlation between LOXL2 and CD206, an M2 macrophage 
polarization marker, has been observed and validated. Collectively, integrated 
single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing analyses revealed an iCAF-related signature 
that can predict prognosis and response to immunotherapy for BCa. Additionally, 
the hub gene LOXL2 may serve as a promising target for BCa treatment."
1730,"Recent introduction of alpha-emitting radionuclides in targeted radionuclide 
therapy has stimulated the development of new radiopharmaceuticals. Preclinical 
evaluation using an animal experiment with an implanted tumor model is 
frequently used to examine the efficiency of the treatment method and to predict 
the treatment response before clinical trials. Here, we propose a mathematical 
model for evaluation of the tumor response in an implanted tumor model and apply 
it to the data obtained from the previous experiment of 211At treatment in a 
thyroid cancer mouse model. The proposed model is based on the set of 
differential equations, describing the kinetics of radiopharmaceuticals, the 
tumor growth, and the treatment response. First, the tumor growth rate was 
estimated from the control data without injection of 211At. The kinetic behavior 
of the injected radionuclide was used to estimate the radiation dose profile to 
the target tumor, which can suppress the tumor growth in a dose-dependent 
manner. An additional two factors, including the time delay for the reduction of 
tumor volume and the impaired recovery of tumor regrowth after the treatment, 
were needed to simulate the temporal changes of tumor size after treatment. 
Finally, the parameters obtained from the simulated tumor growth curve were able 
to predict the tumor response in other experimental settings. The model can 
provide valuable information for planning the administration dose of 
radiopharmaceuticals in clinical trials, especially to determine the starting 
dose at which efficacy can be expected with a sufficient safety margin."
1731,"We previously demonstrated that SAOS human osteosarcoma cells, incubated with 
carotenoid-enriched nanoemulsions (CEN), activated a nonprotective form of 
autophagy and delayed cell proliferation. The present work focuses on the 
biological effects of CEN on a derivative of SAOS cells named SAOS400, recently 
described for their radiation resistance and higher expression of 
therapy-induced senescence (TIS) markers. SAOS400 cells, incubated with CEN, 
activated a ""cytostatic"" form of autophagy confirmed by cell cycle arrest in the 
G2/M phase and increased expression of autophagic proteins. Treatment of SAOS400 
cells with CEN also resulted in decreased expression of the senescence marker 
p16INK4. However, when SAOS400 cells were γ-irradiated in combination with CEN, 
the threshold for cell death was reached (&gt;60% after 96 h). We showed that 
this type of cell death corresponded to 'cytotoxic' or 'lethal' autophagy and 
that the combined treatment of CEN plus γ-rays was synergistic, with the 
combination index &lt; 1. Since CEN contained β-carotene, the pure compound was 
used in SAOS400 cells at the same concentration present in CEN and up to 10 
times higher. However, no radio-sensitizing effect of β-carotene was observed, 
suggesting that the biological effect of CEN was due to less abundant but more 
bioactive molecules, or to the synergistic activity of multiple components 
present in the extracts, confirming the functional pleiotropy of natural 
extracts enriched in bioactive molecules."
1732,"Emerging evidence from research or clinical studies reported that ABCG2 
(ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2) interrelates with multidrug 
resistance (MDR) development in cancers. However, no comprehensive pan-cancer 
analysis is available at present. Therefore, we explore multiple databases, such 
as TCGA to investigate the potential therapeutic roles of ABCG2 across 33 
different tumors. ABCG2 is expressed on a lower level in most cancers and shows 
a protective effect. For example, a lower expression level of ABCG2 was 
detrimental to the survival of adrenocortical carcinoma (TCGA-ACC), glioblastoma 
multiforme (GBM), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) patients. 
Distinct associations exist between ABCG2 expression and stemness scores, 
microenvironmental scores, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor 
mutational burden (TMB) of tumor patients. We observed a significant positive 
correlation between the ABCG2 mutation site and prognosis in uterine corpus 
endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) patients. Moreover, transmembrane transporter 
activity and hormone biosynthetic-associated functions were found to be involved 
in the functionality of ABCG2 and its related genes. The cDNAs of cancer cell 
lines were collected to detect exon mutation sequences and to analyze ABCG2 mRNA 
expression. The mRNA expression level of ABCG2 showed a significant difference 
among spheres and drug-resistant cancer cell lines compared with their 
corresponding adherent cancer cell lines in six types of cancer. This pan-cancer 
study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive understanding of the 
multifunctionality of ABCG2 and unveils further details of the potential 
therapeutic role of ABCG2 in pan-cancer."
1733,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is defined as permanent disorders of movement and posture. 
Prematurity and hypoxia-ischemia (HI) are risk factors of CP, and boys display a 
greater vulnerability to develop CP. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) is administered 
to mothers at risk of preterm delivery as a neuroprotective agent. However, its 
effectiveness is only partial at long term. To prolong MgSO4 effects, it was 
combined with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA). A mouse model of neonatal HI, generating 
lesions similar to those reported in preterms, was realized. At short term, at 
the behavioral and cellular levels, and in both sexes, the MgSO4/4-PBA 
association did not alter the total prevention induced by MgSO4 alone. At long 
term, the association extended the MgSO4 preventive effects on HI-induced motor 
and cognitive deficits. This might be sustained by the promotion of 
oligodendrocyte precursor differentiation after HI at short term, which led to 
improvement of white matter integrity at long term. Interestingly, at long term, 
at a behavioral level, sex-dependent responses to HI were observed. This might 
partly be explained by early sex-dependent pathological processes that occur 
after HI. Indeed, at short term, apoptosis through mitochondrial pathways seemed 
to be activated in females but not in males, and only the MgSO4/4-PBA 
association seemed to counter this apoptotic process."
1734,"SH2 (Src Homology 2) domains are among the best characterized and most studied 
protein-protein interaction (PPIs) modules able to bind and recognize sequences 
presenting a phosphorylated tyrosine. This post-translational modification is a 
key regulator of a plethora of physiological and molecular pathways in the 
eukaryotic cell, so SH2 domains possess a fundamental role in cell signaling. 
Consequently, several pathologies arise from the dysregulation of such 
SH2-domains mediated PPIs. In this review, we recapitulate the current knowledge 
about the structural, folding stability, and binding properties of SH2 domains 
and their roles in molecular pathways and pathogenesis. Moreover, we focus 
attention on the different strategies employed to modulate/inhibit SH2 domains 
binding. Altogether, the information gathered points to evidence that 
pharmacological interest in SH2 domains is highly strategic to developing new 
therapeutics. Moreover, a deeper understanding of the molecular determinants of 
the thermodynamic stability as well as of the binding properties of SH2 domains 
appears to be fundamental in order to improve the possibility of preventing 
their dysregulated interactions."
1735,"Hypertension is one of the most common risk factors for developing chronic 
cardiovascular diseases, including hypertensive nephropathy. Within the 
glomerulus, hypertension causes damage and activation of mesangial cells (MCs), 
eliciting the production of large amounts of vasoactive and proinflammatory 
agents. Accordingly, the activation of AT1 receptors by the vasoactive molecule 
angiotensin II (AngII) contributes to the pathogenesis of renal damage, which is 
mediated mostly by the dysfunction of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) signaling. 
Similarly, inflammation entails complex processes, where [Ca2+]i also play 
crucial roles. Deregulation of this second messenger increases cell damage and 
promotes fibrosis, reduces renal blood flow, and impairs the glomerular 
filtration barrier. In vertebrates, [Ca2+]i signaling depends, in part, on the 
activity of two families of large-pore channels: hemichannels and pannexons. 
Interestingly, the opening of these channels depends on [Ca2+]i signaling. In 
this review, we propose that the opening of channels formed by connexins and/or 
pannexins mediated by AngII induces the ATP release to the extracellular media, 
with the subsequent activation of purinergic receptors. This process could 
elicit Ca2+ overload and constitute a feed-forward mechanism, leading to kidney 
damage."
1736,"CD24 is a mucin-like immunosuppressing glycoprotein whose levels increase during 
pregnancy and decrease in the syncytio- and cytotrophoblasts in early and 
preterm preeclampsia. We used two modified cell lines that mimic in vitro 
features of preeclampsia to identify if this phenomenon could be reproduced. Our 
model was the immortalized placental-derived BeWo and JEG-3 cell lines that 
overexpress the STOX1 A/B transcription factor gene that was discovered in 
familial forms of preeclampsia. BeWo and JEG-3 cells stably transduced with the 
two major isoforms of STOX1-A/B or by an empty vector (control), were 
propagated, harvested, and analyzed. CD24 mRNA expression was determined by 
quantitative real-time polymerase nuclear chain reaction (qRT-PCR). CD24 protein 
levels were determined by Western blots. In STOX1-A/B overexpressing in BeWo 
cells, CD24 mRNA was downregulated by 91 and 85%, respectively, compared to the 
control, and by 30% and 74%, respectively in JEG-3 cells. A 67% and 82% decrease 
in CD24 protein level was determined by immunoblot in BeWo overexpressing 
STOX1-A/B, respectively, while the reduction in JEG-3 cells was between 47 and 
62%. The immortalized BeWo and JEG-3 cell lines overexpressing STOX1-A/B had 
reduced CD24. Although both cell lines were affected, BeWo appears to be more 
susceptible to downregulation by STOX-1 than JEG-3, potentially because of their 
different cell origin and properties. These results strengthen the in vivo 
results of reduced CD24 levels found in early and preterm preeclampsia. 
Accordingly, it implies the importance of the reduced immune tolerance in 
preeclampsia, which was already demonstrated in vivo in the STOX1-A/B model of 
preeclampsia, and is now implied in the in vitro STOX-1 model, a subject that 
warrants further investigations."
1737,"Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, and its 
incidence and death rates have been consistently high throughout the past 
decades. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently gained significant attention because 
of their role in the regulation of a variety of biological processes via 
post-transcriptional silencing mechanisms. Previously, we determined a specific 
profile of miRNAs associated with HNC using a miRNA microarray analysis. Of the 
23 miRNAs with highly altered expression in HNC cells, miR-503 was the most 
significantly downregulated miRNA. In this study, we confirmed that miR-503 acts 
as a tumor suppressor, as our results showed decreased levels of miR-503 in 
cancer cells and patients with HNC. We further characterized the role of miR-503 
in the malignant functions of HNC. Although there was a minimal effect on cell 
growth, miR-503 was found to inhibit cellular invasion significantly. 
Algorithm-based studies identified multiple potential target genes and pathways 
associated with oncogenic mechanisms. The candidate target gene, WNT3A, was 
confirmed to be downregulated by miR-503 at both the mRNA and protein levels and 
validated by a reporter assay. Furthermore, miR-503 modulated multiple 
invasion-associated genes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), through 
the Wnt downstream signaling pathway. Overall, this study demonstrates that 
miR-503 suppresses HNC malignancy by inhibiting cell invasion through the Wnt 
signaling pathway via the WNT3A/MMP molecular axis. The modulation of miR-503 
may be a novel therapeutic approach to intervene in cancer invasion."
1738,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy characterized by 
clonal expansion of stem and myeloid progenitor cells. Immunotherapy has 
revolutionized the care for other cancers such as solid tumors and lymphomas, 
and has the potential to effectively treat AML. There has been substantial 
progress in the developments of immunotherapeutic approaches for AML over the 
last several years, including the development of antibodies that further 
increase the innate immunogenicity of leukemia cells by the inhibition of NKG2D 
ligand-particularly MICA and MICB-shedding, chimeric proteins such as IL-15 
superagonist that expand natural killer (NK) cells, blockers of immunologic 
checkpoints such as NKG2A, and chemicals that indirectly increase expression of 
immune stimulatory proteins in leukemia stem cells. Furthermore, cellular 
therapies have been designed to enable alloreactive immunity by allogeneic NK 
cells or target leukemia antigens such as mutated NPM1. These immunotherapeutic 
approaches have demonstrated remarkable efficacies in preclinical studies and 
have successfully transitioned to early phase clinical trials, to establish 
safety and initial signal of clinical activity. Here, we briefly discuss some of 
the most recent and impactful developments in the AML immunotherapy field and 
provide our perspectives for the future directions of this exciting and new 
therapeutic opportunity."
1739,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by its high vascularity and 
metastasis. Thymoquinone (TQ), the main bio-active constituent of Nigella 
sativa, has shown anticancer and hepatoprotective effects. TQ's anticancer 
effect is mediated through miRNA regulation. miR-1-3p plays a significant role 
in various cancers but its role in HCC invasiveness remains poorly understood. 
Bio-informatics analysis predicted that the 3'-UTR of TIMP3 is a target for 
miR-1-3p; Rats were equally divided into four groups: Group 1, the negative 
control; Group 2 received TQ; Group 3 received DEN; and Group 4 received DEN 
after pretreatment with TQ. The expression of TIMP3, MMP2, MMP9, and VEGF in 
rats' liver was determined immunohistochemically. RT-qPCR was used to measure 
the miR-1-3p level in rats' liver, and TIMP3, MMP2, MMP9, and VEGF in the HepG2 
cells after being transfected with miR-1-3p mimic or inhibitor; In rats 
pretreated with TQ, a decreased expression of MMP2, MMP9 and VEGF, and increased 
expression levels of TIMP3 and miR-1-3p were detected. Treating the HepG2 cells 
with miR-1-3p mimic led to the upregulation of TIMP3 and downregulation of MMP2, 
MMP9, and VEGF, and showed a significant delay in wound healing; These results 
suggested that the anti-angiogenic effect of TQ in HCC may be mediated through 
the regulation of miR-1-3p."
1740,"Cellular functions depend on the dynamic assembly of protein regulator complexes 
at specific cellular locations. Single Molecule Tracking (SMT) is a method of 
choice for the biochemical characterization of protein dynamics in vitro and in 
vivo. SMT follows individual molecules in live cells and provides direct 
information about their behavior. SMT was successfully applied to mammalian 
models. However, mammalian cells provide a complex environment where protein 
mobility depends on numerous factors that are difficult to control 
experimentally. Therefore, yeast cells, which are unicellular and well-studied 
with a small and completely sequenced genome, provide an attractive alternative 
for SMT. The simplicity of organization, ease of genetic manipulation, and 
tolerance to gene fusions all make yeast a great model for quantifying the 
kinetics of major enzymes, membrane proteins, and nuclear and cellular bodies. 
However, very few researchers apply SMT techniques to yeast. Our goal is to 
promote SMT in yeast to a wider research community. Our review serves a dual 
purpose. We explain how SMT is conducted in yeast cells, and we discuss the 
latest insights from yeast SMT while putting them in perspective with SMT of 
higher eukaryotes."
1741,"Redox equilibria and the modulation of redox signalling play crucial roles in 
physiological processes. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
disrupts the body's antioxidant defence, compromising redox homeostasis and 
increasing oxidative stress, leading to the development of several diseases. 
Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is a principal antioxidant enzyme that 
protects cells from oxidative damage by converting superoxide anion radicals to 
hydrogen peroxide and oxygen in mitochondria. Systematic studies have 
demonstrated that MnSOD plays an indispensable role in multiple diseases. This 
review focuses on preclinical evidence that describes the mechanisms of MnSOD in 
diseases accompanied with an imbalanced redox status, including fibrotic 
diseases, inflammation, diabetes, vascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, 
and cancer. The potential therapeutic effects of MnSOD activators and MnSOD 
mimetics are also discussed. Targeting this specific superoxide anion radical 
scavenger may be a clinically beneficial strategy, and understanding the 
therapeutic role of MnSOD may provide a positive insight into preventing and 
treating related diseases."
1742,"The persistence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as the principal 
complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) demonstrates 
that HLA matching alone is insufficient to prevent alloreactivity. We performed 
molecular and functional characterization of 22 candidate cytokine genes for 
their potential to improve matching in 315 myeloablative, 10/10 HLA-matched 
donor-recipient pairs. Recipients of a graft carrying the -1082GG IL10 gene 
promoter region variant had a three-fold lower incidence of grade II-IV acute 
GVHD compared to IL10-1082AA graft recipients (SHR = 0.25, p = 0.005). This was 
most evident in matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplants, where the greatest 
alloreactivity is expected. IL10-1082GG transplants did not experience an 
increased incidence of relapse, and, consequently, overall survival was two-fold 
higher in IL10-1082GG MUD transplants (HR = 0.17, p = 0.023). Longitudinal 
post-transplant measurements demonstrated that -1082GG is a high-IL10-producing 
and -expressing genotype with attenuated CD8+ T-cell reconstitution. High 
post-transplant donor chimerism in T- and myeloid-cells (&gt;95%) confirmed a 
predominant donor, rather than recipient, genotype effect on immune function and 
aGVHD. To date, this is the first study to report corroborating 
genome-to-cellular evidence for a non-HLA donor immunogenetic variant that 
appears to be protective against GVHD. The incorporation of IL10 variants in 
donor selection criteria and clinical-management decisions has the potential to 
improve patient outcomes."
1743,"Over the past two decades, the treatment landscape for multiple myeloma (MM) has 
progressed significantly, with the introduction of several new drug classes that 
have greatly improved patient outcomes. At present, it is well known how the 
bone marrow (BM) microenvironment (ME) exerts an immunosuppressive action 
leading to an exhaustion of the immune system cells and promoting the 
proliferation and sustenance of tumor plasma cells. Therefore, having drugs that 
can reconstitute a healthy BM ME can improve results in MM patients. Recent 
findings clearly demonstrated that achieving minimal residual disease (MRD) 
negativity and sustaining MRD negativity over time play a pivotal prognostic 
role. However, despite the achievement of MRD negativity, patients may still 
relapse. The understanding of immunologic changes in the BM ME during treatment, 
complemented by a deeper knowledge of plasma cell genomics and biology, will be 
critical to develop future therapies to sustain MRD negativity over time and 
possibly achieve an operational cure. In this review, we focus on the components 
of the BM ME and their role in MM, on the prognostic significance of MRD 
negativity and, finally, on the relative contribution of tumor plasma cell 
biology and BM ME to long-term disease control."
1744,"Most glioblastoma studies incorporate the layer of tumor molecular subtype based 
on the four-subtype classification system proposed in 2010. Nevertheless, there 
is no universally recognized and convenient tool for glioblastoma molecular 
subtyping, and each study applies a different set of markers and/or approaches 
that cause inconsistencies in data comparability and reproducibility between 
studies. Thus, this study aimed to create an applicable user-friendly tool for 
glioblastoma classification, with high accuracy, while using a significantly 
smaller number of variables. The study incorporated a TCGA microarray, 
sequencing datasets, and an independent cohort of 56 glioblastomas (LUHS 
cohort). The models were constructed by applying the Agilent G4502 dataset, and 
they were tested using the Affymetrix HG-U133a and Illumina Hiseq cohorts, as 
well as the LUHS cases. Two classification models were constructed by applying a 
logistic regression classification algorithm, based on the mRNA levels of twenty 
selected genes. The classifiers were translated to a RT-qPCR assay and validated 
in an independent cohort of 56 glioblastomas. The classification accuracy of the 
20-gene and 5-gene classifiers varied between 90.7-91% and 85.9-87.7%, 
respectively. With this work, we propose a cost-efficient three-class 
(classical, mesenchymal, and proneural) tool for glioblastoma molecular 
classification based on the mRNA analysis of only 5-20 genes, and we provide the 
basic information for classification performance starting from the wet-lab 
stage. We hope that the proposed classification tool will enable data 
comparability between different research groups."
1745,"Cisplatin treatment is one of the most commonly used treatments for patients 
with cancer. However, thirty percent of patients treated with cisplatin develop 
acute kidney injury (AKI). Several studies have demonstrated the effect of 
bioactive vitamin D or calcitriol on the inflammatory process and endothelial 
injury, essential events that contribute to changes in renal function and 
structure caused by cisplatin (CP). This study explored the effects of 
calcitriol administration on proximal tubular injury, oxidative stress, 
inflammation and vascular injury observed in CP-induced AKI. Male Wistar 
Hannover rats were pretreated with calcitriol (6 ng/day) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl). 
The treatment started two weeks before i.p. administration of CP or saline and 
was maintained for another five days after the injections. On the fifth day 
after the injections, urine, plasma and renal tissue samples were collected to 
evaluate renal function and structure. The animals of the CP group had increased 
plasma levels of creatinine and of fractional sodium excretion and decreased 
glomerular filtration rates. These changes were associated with intense tubular 
injury, endothelial damage, reductions in antioxidant enzymes and an 
inflammatory process observed in the renal outer medulla of the animals from 
this group. These changes were attenuated by treatment with calcitriol, which 
reduced the inflammation and increased the expression of vascular regeneration 
markers and antioxidant enzymes."
1746,"99-Metastabil Technetium (99mTc) is a radiopharmaceutical widely used in 
skeletal scintigraphy. Recent publications show it can also be used to determine 
the osteogenic potential of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) by binding to 
hydroxyapatite formed during bone tissue engineering. This field lacks 
non-destructive methods to track live osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. 
However, no data about the uptake kinetics of 99mTc and its effect on 
osteogenesis of hMSCs have been published yet. We therefore evaluated the 
saturation time of 99mTc by incubating hMSC cultures for different periods, and 
the saturation concentration by using different amounts of 99mTc activity for 
incubation. The influence of 99mTc on osteogenic potential of hMSCs was then 
evaluated by labeling a continuous hMSC culture three times over the course of 3 
weeks, and comparing the findings to cultures labeled once. Our findings show 
that 99mTc saturation time is less than 0.25 h, and saturation concentration is 
between 750 and 1000 MBq. Repeated exposure to γ-radiation emitted by 99mTc had 
no negative effects on hMSC cultures. These new insights can be used to make 
this highly promising method broadly available to support researchers in the 
field of bone tissue engineering using this method to track and evaluate, in 
real-time, the osteogenic differentiation of hMSC, without any negative 
influence on the cell viability, or their osteogenic differentiation potential."
1747,"GEP-NETs are heterogeneous tumors originating from the pancreas (panNET) or the 
intestinal tract. Only a few patients with NETs are amenable to curative tumor 
resection, and for most patients, only palliative treatments to successfully 
control the disease or manage symptoms remain, such as with synthetic 
somatostatin (SST) analogs (SSAs), such as octreotide (OCT) or lanreotide (LAN). 
However, even cells expressing low levels of SST receptors (SSTRs) may exhibit 
significant responses to OCT, which suggests the possibility that SSAs signal 
through alternative mechanisms, e.g., transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. This 
signaling mode has been demonstrated in the established panNET line BON but not 
yet in other permanent (i.e., QGP) or primary (i.e., NT-3) panNET-derived cells. 
Here, we performed qPCR, immunoblot analyses, and cell counting assays to assess 
the effects of SST, OCT, LAN, and TGF-β1 on neuroendocrine marker expression and 
cell proliferation in NT-3, QGP, and BON cells. SST and SSAs were found to 
regulate a set of neuroendocrine genes in all three cell lines, with the effects 
of SST, mainly LAN, often differing from those of OCT. However, unlike NT-3 
cells, BON cells failed to respond to OCT with growth arrest but paradoxically 
exhibited a growth-stimulatory effect after treatment with LAN. As previously 
shown for BON, NT-3 cells responded to TGF-β1 treatment with induction of 
expression of SST and SSTR2/5. Of note, the ability of NT-3 cells to respond to 
TGF-β1 with upregulation of the established TGF-β target gene SERPINE1 depended 
on cellular adherence to a collagen-coated matrix. Moreover, when applied to 
NT-3 cells for an extended period, i.e., 14 days, TGF-β1 induced growth 
suppression as shown earlier for BON cells. Finally, next-generation 
sequencing-based identification of microRNAs (miRNAs) in BON and NT-3 revealed 
that SST and OCT impact positively or negatively on the regulation of specific 
miRNAs. Our results suggest that primary panNET cells, such as NT-3, respond 
similarly as BON cells to SST, SSA, and TGF-β treatment and thus provide 
circumstantial evidence that crosstalk of SST and TGF-β signaling is not 
confined to BON cells but is a general feature of panNETs."
1748,"Triple-negative breast cancer is more aggressive than other types of breast 
cancer. Protein kinase R (PKR), which is activated by dsRNA, is known to play a 
role in doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis; however, its role in DNA damage-mediated 
apoptosis is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the roles of 
PKR and its downstream players in doxorubicin-treated HCC1143 triple-negative 
breast cancer cells. Doxorubicin treatment induces DNA damage and apoptosis. 
Interestingly, doxorubicin treatment induced the phosphorylation of eukaryotic 
initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) via PKR, whereas the inhibition of PKR with 
inhibitor C16 reduced eIF2α phosphorylation. Under these conditions, 
doxorubicin-mediated DNA fragmentation, cell death, and poly(ADP ribose) 
polymerase and caspase 7 levels were recovered. In addition, phosphorylation of 
checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), which is known to be involved in 
doxorubicin-mediated DNA damage, was increased by doxorubicin treatment, but 
blocked by PKR inhibition. Protein translation was downregulated by doxorubicin 
treatment and upregulated by blocking PKR phosphorylation. These results suggest 
that PKR activation induces apoptosis by increasing the phosphorylation of eIF2α 
and CHK1 and decreasing the global protein translation in doxorubicin-treated 
HCC1143 triple-negative breast cancer cells."
1749,"Isolation of bioactive products from the marine environment is considered a very 
promising approach to identify new compounds that can be used for further drug 
development. In this work we have isolated three new compounds from the 
purpuroine family by mass-guided preparative HPLC; purpuroine K-M. These 
compounds where screened for antibacterial- and antifungal activity, antibiofilm 
formation and anti-cell proliferation activity. Additionally, apoptosis-, cell 
cycle-, kinase binding- and docking studies were performed to evaluate the 
mechanism-of-action. None of the compounds showed activity in antibacterial-, 
antibiofilm- or antifungal assays. However, one of the isolated compounds, 
purpuroine K, showed activity against two cell lines, MV-4-11 and MOLM-13, two 
AML cell lines both carrying the FTL3-ITD mutation. In MV-4-11 cells, purpuroine 
K was found to increase apoptosis and arrest cells cycle in G1/G0, which is a 
common feature of FLT3 inhibitors. Interactions between purpuroine K and the 
FLT3 wild type or FLT3 ITD mutant proteins could however not be elucidated in 
our kinase binding and docking studies. In conclusion, we have isolated three 
novel molecules, purpuroine K-M, one of which (purpuroine K) shows a potent 
activity against FLT3-ITD mutated AML cell lines, however, the molecular 
target(s) of purpuroine K still need to be further investigated."
1750,"p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers. Two fundamental reasons 
for this are its long protein isoforms protect from cancer, while its shorter 
C-terminal isoforms can support cancer and metastasis. Previously, we have shown 
that the Δ160p53 protein isoform enhances survival and the invasive character of 
cancer cells. Here, we identified a translation initiation site nine codons 
downstream of codon 160-the known initiation codon for the translation of 
Δ160p53-that is recognized by the translation machinery. When translation failed 
to initiate from AUG160 due to mutation, it initiated from AUG169 instead, 
producing similar levels of a similar protein, Δ169p53, which promoted cell 
survival as efficiently as Δ160p53 following DNA damage. Interestingly, almost 
all mammalian species with an orthologue to human AUG160 also possess one for 
AUG169, while none of the non-mammalian species lacking AUG160 have AUG169, even 
if that region of the p53 gene is well conserved. In view of our findings, we do 
not believe that Δ169p53 acts as a different p53 protein isoform; instead, we 
propose that the double translation initiation site strengthens the translation 
of these products with a critical role in cell homeostasis. Future studies will 
help verify if this is a more general mechanism for the expression of essential 
proteins in mammals."
1751,"Cannabidiol (CBD) is an active natural compound that is extracted from Cannabis 
sativa. Previous studies show that CBD is a nonpsychotropic compound with 
significant anticancer effects. This study determines its cytotoxic effect on 
oral cancer cells and OEC-M1 cells and compares the outcomes with a 
chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin. This study has investigated the effect of CBD 
on the viability, apoptosis, morphology, and migration of OEC-M1 cells. Electric 
cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is used to measure the change in cell 
impedance for cells that are treated with a series concentration of CBD for 24 
h. AlamarBlue and annexin V/7-AAD staining assays show that CBD has a cytotoxic 
effect on cell viability and induces cell apoptosis. ECIS analysis shows that 
CBD decreases the overall resistance and morphological parameters at 4 kHz in a 
concentration-dependent manner. There is a significant reduction in the 
wound-healing recovery rate for cells that are treated with 30 μM CBD. This 
study demonstrates that ECIS can be used for in vitro screening of new 
chemotherapy and is more sensitive, functional, and comprehensive than 
traditional biochemical assays. CBD also increases cytotoxicity on cell survival 
and the migration of oral cancer cells, so it may be a therapeutic drug for oral 
cancer."
1752,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
can cause low survival rates in mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer 
patients. It is necessary to predict new mutations in the development of more 
potent EGFR inhibitors since classical and rare mutations observed were known to 
affect the effectiveness of the therapy. Therefore, this research aimed to 
perform alanine mutagenesis scanning on ATP binding site residues without COSMIC 
data, followed by molecular dynamic simulations to determine their molecular 
interactions with ATP and erlotinib compared to wild-type complexes. Based on 
the result, eight mutations were found to cause changes in the binding energy of 
the ATP analogue to become more negative. These included G779A, Q791A, L792A, 
R841A, N842A, V843A, I853A, and D855A, which were predicted to enhance the 
affinity of ATP and reduce the binding ability of inhibitors with the same 
interaction site. Erlotinib showed more positive energy among G779A, Q791A, 
I853A, and D855A, due to their weaker binding energy than ATP. These four 
mutations could be anticipated in the development of the next inhibitor to 
overcome the incidence of resistance in lung cancer patients."
1753,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a heterogeneous group of 
cancers and patients have limited therapy options if primary treatment fails. 
Therefore, additional information about the biology of the tumor is essential. 
Here we performed a feasibility study of concurrently applying two precision 
diagnostic tools in a consecutive series of HNSCC patients. We analyzed tumor 
samples of 31 patients using a genomic (oncomine) and a proteomic, 
immunohistochemical approach (oncopanel) and compared the result, also in the 
focus on their overlapping therapeutical targets. We found no strong correlation 
between the two approaches and observed a higher proportion of marker expression 
for the immunohistochemical panel. However, both panels show in our HNSCC cohort 
distinct patterns with druggable targets. The data suggest that both approaches 
complement one another and can be applied side-by-side to identify the best 
targets for the development of individual treatment options for HNSCC patients."
1754,"Cellular metabolism governs the signaling that supports physiological mechanisms 
and homeostasis in an individual, including neuronal transmission, wound 
healing, and circadian clock manipulation. Various factors have been linked to 
abnormal metabolic reprogramming, including gene mutations, epigenetic 
modifications, altered protein epitopes, and their involvement in the 
development of disease, including cancer. The presence of multiple distinct 
hallmarks and the resulting cellular reprogramming process have gradually 
revealed that these metabolism-related molecules may be able to be used to track 
or prevent the progression of cancer. Consequently, translational medicines have 
been developed using metabolic substrates, precursors, and other products 
depending on their biochemical mechanism of action. It is important to note that 
these metabolic analogs can also be used for imaging and therapeutic purposes in 
addition to competing for metabolic functions. In particular, due to their 
isotopic labeling, these compounds may also be used to localize and visualize 
tumor cells after uptake. In this review, the current development status, 
applicability, and limitations of compounds targeting metabolic reprogramming 
are described, as well as the imaging platforms that are most suitable for each 
compound and the types of cancer to which they are most appropriate."
1755,"Neutrophils represent the most abundant cell type of leukocytes in the human 
blood and have been considered a vital player in the innate immune system and 
the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Recently, several studies 
showed that neutrophils play an active role in the immune response during cancer 
development. They exhibited both pro-oncogenic and anti-tumor activities under 
the influence of various mediators in the tumor microenvironment. Neutrophils 
can be divided into several subpopulations, thus contradicting the traditional 
concept of neutrophils as a homogeneous population with a specific function in 
the innate immunity and opening new horizons for cancer therapy. Despite the 
promising achievements in this field, a full understanding of tumor-neutrophil 
interplay is currently lacking. In this review, we try to summarize the current 
view on neutrophil heterogeneity in cancer, discuss the different communication 
pathways between tumors and neutrophils, and focus on the implementation of 
these new findings to develop promising neutrophil-based cancer therapies."
1756,"Assessment of T-cell response to the tumor is important for diagnosis of the 
disease and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy. For this, new non-destructive 
label-free methods are required. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of 
metabolic coenzymes is a promising innovative technology for the assessment of 
the functional status of cells. The purpose of this work was to test whether 
FLIM can resolve metabolic alterations that accompany T-cell reactivation to the 
tumors. The study was carried out on C57Bl/6 FoxP3-EGFP mice bearing B16F0 
melanoma. Autofluorescence of the immune cells in fresh lymphatic nodes (LNs) 
was investigated. It was found that fluorescence lifetime parameters of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) NAD(P)H are sensitive to tumor 
development. Effector T-cells in the LNs displayed higher contribution of free 
NADH, the form associated with glycolysis, in all tumors and the presence of 
protein-bound NADPH, associated with biosynthetic processes, in the tumors of 
large size. Flow cytometry showed that the changes in the NADH fraction of the 
effector T-cells correlated with their activation, while changes in NADPH 
correlated with cell proliferation. In conclusion, FLIM of NAD(P)H in fresh 
lymphoid tissue is a powerful tool for assessing the immune response to tumor 
development."
1757,"Immunotoxins (ITs), which are toxin-fused tumor antigen-specific antibody 
chimeric proteins, have been developed to selectively kill targeted cancer 
cells. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an attractive target for 
the development of anti-EGFR ITs against solid tumors due to its overexpression 
on the cell surface of various solid tumors. However, the low basal level 
expression of EGFR in normal tissue cells can cause undesirable 
on-target/off-tumor toxicity and reduce the therapeutic window of anti-EGFR ITs. 
Here, based on an anti-EGFR monobody with cross-reactivity to both human and 
murine EGFR, we developed a strategy to tailor the anti-EGFR affinity of the 
monobody-based ITs carrying a 24-kDa fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE24), 
termed ER-PE24, to distinguish tumors that overexpress EGFR from normal tissues. 
Five variants of ER-PE24 were generated with different EGFR affinities (KD ≈ 
0.24 nM to 104 nM), showing comparable binding activity for both human and 
murine EGFR. ER/0.2-PE24 with the highest affinity (KD ≈ 0.24 nM) exhibited a 
narrow therapeutic window of 19 pM to 93 pM, whereas ER/21-PE24 with an 
intermediate affinity (KD ≈ 21 nM) showed a much broader therapeutic window of 
73 pM to 1.5 nM in in vitro cytotoxic assays using tumor model cell lines. In 
EGFR-overexpressing tumor xenograft mouse models, the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) of intravenous injection of ER/21-PE24 was found to be 0.4 mg/kg, which 
was fourfold higher than the MTD (0.1 mg/kg) of ER/0.2-PE24. Our study provides 
a strategy for the development of IT targeting tumor overexpressed antigens with 
basal expression in broad normal tissues by tailoring tumor antigen affinities."
1758,"Reactive oxygen species are formed as by-products of normal cell metabolism. 
They are needed to maintain cell homeostasis and signaling, which is possible 
due to defense systems. Disruption of this balance leads to oxidative stress 
that can induce cancer. Redox regulation by miRNAs may be a potential 
therapeutic target. The aim of the study was to assess the activity of genes 
associated with oxidative stress in endometrial cancer and to determine their 
relationship with miRNAs. The study included 45 patients with endometrioid 
endometrial cancer and 45 without neoplastic changes. The expression profile of 
genes associated with oxidative stress was determined with mRNA microarrays, 
RT-qPCR and ELISA. The miRNA prediction was performed based on the miRNA 
microarray experiment and the mirDB tool. PRDX2 and AQP1 showed overexpression 
that was probably not related to miRNA activity. A high level of PKD2 may be the 
result of a decrease in the activity of miR-195-3p, miR-20a, miR-134. A SOD3 
level reduction can be caused by miR-328, miR-363. In addition, miR-363 can also 
regulate KLF2 expression. In the course of endometrial cancer, the phenomenon of 
oxidative stress is observed, the regulation of which may be influenced by 
miRNAs."
1759,"Recent advances in nanomedicine toward cancer treatment have considered 
exploiting liposomes and extracellular vesicles as effective cargos to deliver 
therapeutic agents to tumor cells. Meanwhile, solid-state nanoparticles are 
continuing to attract interest for their great medical potential thanks to their 
countless properties and possible applications. However, possible drawbacks 
arising from the use of nanoparticles in nanomedicine, such as the nonspecific 
uptake of these materials in healthy organs, their aggregation in biological 
environments and their possible immunogenicity, must be taken into account. 
Considering these limitations and the intrinsic capability of phospholipidic 
bilayers to act as a biocompatible shield, their exploitation for effectively 
encasing solid-state nanoparticles seems a promising strategy to broaden the 
frontiers of cancer nanomedicine, also providing the possibility to engineer the 
lipid bilayers to further enhance the therapeutic potential of such nanotools. 
This work aims to give a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in 
the use of artificial liposomes and naturally derived extracellular vesicles for 
the coating of solid-state nanoparticles for cancer treatment, starting from in 
vitro works until the up-to-date advances and current limitations of these 
nanopharmaceutics in clinical applications, passing through in vivo and 3D 
cultures studies."
1760,"An ability of poorly differentiated cells of different genesis, including tumor 
stem-like cells (TSCs), to internalize extracellular double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 
fragments was revealed in our studies. Using the models of Krebs-2 murine 
ascites carcinoma and EBV-induced human B-cell lymphoma culture, we demonstrated 
that dsDNA internalization into the cell consists of several mechanistically 
distinct phases. The primary contact with cell membrane factors is determined by 
electrostatic interactions. Firm contacts with cell envelope proteins are then 
formed, followed by internalization into the cell of the complex formed between 
the factor and the dsDNA probe bound to it. The key binding sites were found to 
be the heparin-binding domains, which are constituents of various cell surface 
proteins of TSCs-either the C1q domain, the collagen-binding domain, or domains 
of positively charged amino acids. These results imply that the interaction 
between extracellular dsDNA fragments and the cell, as well as their 
internalization, took place with the involvement of glycocalyx components 
(proteoglycans/glycoproteins (PGs/GPs) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored 
proteins (GPI-APs)) and the system of scavenger receptors (SRs), which are 
characteristic of TSCs and form functional clusters of cell surface proteins in 
TSCs. The key provisions of the concept characterizing the principle of 
organization of the ""group-specific"" cell surface factors of TSCs of various 
geneses were formulated. These factors belong to three protein clusters: 
GPs/PGs, GIP-APs, and SRs. For TSCs of different tumors, these clusters were 
found to be represented by different members with homotypic functions 
corresponding to the general function of the cluster to which they belong."
1761,"Glycosylation, which consists of the enzymatic addition of sugars to proteins 
and lipids, is one of the most important post-co-synthetic modifications of 
these molecules, profoundly affecting their activity. Although the presence of 
carbohydrate chains is crucial for fine-tuning the interactions between cells 
and molecules, glycosylation is an intrinsically stochastic process regulated by 
the relative abundance of biosynthetic (glycosyltransferases) and catabolic 
(glycosidases) enzymes, as well as sugar carriers and other molecules. 
Non-coding RNAs, which include microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circRNAs, 
establish a complex network of reciprocally interacting molecules whose final 
goal is the regulation of mRNA expression. Likewise, these interactions are 
stochastically regulated by ncRNA abundance. Thus, while protein sequence is 
deterministically dictated by the DNA/RNA/protein axis, protein abundance and 
activity are regulated by two stochastic processes acting, respectively, before 
and after the biosynthesis of the protein axis. Consequently, the worlds of 
glycosylation and ncRNA are closely interconnected and mutually interacting. In 
this paper, we will extensively review the many faces of the ncRNA-glycosylation 
interplay in cancer and other physio-pathological conditions."
1762,"Hyperprogressive disease (HPD), an aggressive acceleration of tumor growth, was 
observed in a group of cancer patients treated with anti-PD1/PDL1 antibodies. 
The presence of a peculiar macrophage subset in the tumor microenvironment is 
reported to be a sort of ""immunological prerequisite"" for HPD development. These 
macrophages possess a unique phenotype that it is not clear how they acquire. We 
hypothesized that certain malignant cells may promote the induction of an 
""HPD-related"" phenotype in macrophages. Bone-marrow-derived macrophages were 
exposed to the conditioned medium of five non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. 
Macrophage phenotype was analyzed by microarray gene expression profile and 
real-time PCR. We found that human NSCLC cell lines, reported as undergoing 
HPD-like tumor growth in immunodeficient mice, polarized macrophages towards a 
peculiar pro-inflammatory phenotype sharing both M1 and M2 features. Lipid-based 
factors contained in cancer cell-conditioned medium induced the over-expression 
of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of innate immune 
receptor signaling pathways. We also determined that tumor-derived Extracellular 
Vesicles represent the main components involved in the observed macrophage 
re-education program. The present study might represent the starting point for 
the future development of diagnostic tools to identify potential 
hyperprogressors."
1763,"Time-gated fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy with the o-BMVC fluorescent 
probe provides a visualizing method for the study of exogenous G-quadruplexes 
(G4s) in live cancer cells. Previously, imaging results showed that the parallel 
G4s are accumulated and that nonparallel G4s are not detected in the lysosomes 
of CL1-0 live cells. In this work, the detection of the G4 signals from 
exogenous GTERT-d(FN) G4s in the lysosomes may involve a structural change in 
live cells from intramolecular nonparallel G4s to intermolecular parallel G4s. 
Moreover, the detection of the G4 signals in the lysosomes after the 48 h 
incubation of HT23 G4s with CL1-0 live cells indicates the occurrence of 
structural conversion from the nonparallel G4s to the parallel G4s of HT23 in 
the live cells. In addition, the detection of much stronger G4 signals from 
ss-GTERT-d(FN) than ss-HT23 in the lysosomes of CL1-0 live cells may be 
explained by the quick formation of the intermolecular parallel G4s of 
ss-GTERT-d(FN) and the degradation of ss-HT23 before its intramolecular parallel 
G4 formation. This work provides a new approach to studying G4-lysosome 
interactions in live cells."
1764,"BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most frequently mutated genes in ovarian cancer (OC) 
crucial both for the identification of cancer predisposition and therapeutic 
choices. However, germline variants in other genes could be involved in OC 
susceptibility. We characterized OC patients to detect mutations in genes other 
than BRCA1/2 that could be associated with a high risk of developing OC and 
permit patients to enter the most appropriate treatment and surveillance 
program. Next-generation sequencing analysis with a 94-gene panel was performed 
on germline DNA of 219 OC patients. We identified 34 pathogenic/likely 
pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 and 38 in other 21 genes. The patients with 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in the non-BRCA1/2 genes mainly developed 
OC alone compared to the other groups that also developed breast cancer or other 
tumors (p = 0.001). Clinical correlation analysis showed that the low-risk 
patients were significantly associated with platinum sensitivity (p &lt; 0.001). 
Regarding PARP inhibitors (PARPi) response, the patients with pathogenic 
mutations in the non-BRCA1/2 genes had worse PFS and OS. Moreover, a 
statistically significantly worse PFS was found for every increase of one 
thousand platelets before PARPi treatment. To conclude, knowledge about 
molecular alterations in genes beyond BRCA1/2 in OC could allow for more 
personalized diagnostic, predictive, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies for 
OC patients."
1765,"Using a model of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) in vitro and in vivo, we previously 
demonstrated increased antitumor activity in CD8+ T-cells reprogrammed with an 
MEK inhibitor and PD-1 blocker. In this follow-up study, we carried out the 
reprogramming of human CD8+ T-cells (hrT-cell) using the MEK inhibitor and PD-1 
blocker and targeted LLC cells. The effects of hrT-cell therapy were studied in 
a mouse model of spontaneous metastasis of a solid LLC tumor. We found 
antimetastatic activity of hrT-cells, a decrease in the number of cancer cells 
and cancer stem cells in the lungs, and an increase in the number of T-cells in 
the blood (including effector T-cells). Thus, reprogramming of human CD8+ 
T-cells with an MEK inhibitor and PD-1 blocker with targeted training by tumor 
target cells is a potential platform for developing a new approach to targeted 
lung cancer therapy."
1766,"As a well-known cancer-related miRNA, miR-193b-3p is enriched in skeletal muscle 
and dysregulated in muscle disease. However, the mechanism underpinning this has 
not been addressed so far. Here, we probed the impact of miR-193b-3p on 
myogenesis by mainly using goat tissues and skeletal muscle satellite cells 
(MuSCs), compared with mouse C2C12 myoblasts. miR-193b-3p is highly expressed in 
goat skeletal muscles, and ectopic miR-193b-3p promotes MuSCs proliferation and 
differentiation. Moreover, insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA-binding protein 1 
(IGF2BP1) is the most activated insulin signaling gene when there is 
overexpression of miR-193b-3p; the miRNA recognition element (MRE) within the 
IGF1BP1 3' untranslated region (UTR) is indispensable for its activation. 
Consistently, expression patterns and functions of IGF2BP1 were similar to those 
of miR-193b-3p in tissues and MuSCs. In comparison, ectopic miR-193b-3p failed 
to induce PAX7 expression and myoblast proliferation when there was IGF2BP1 
knockdown. Furthermore, miR-193b-3p destabilized IGF2BP1 mRNA, but unexpectedly 
promoted levels of IGF2BP1 heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA), dramatically. Moreover, 
miR-193b-3p could induce its neighboring genes. However, miR-193b-3p inversely 
regulated IGF2BP1 and myoblast proliferation in the mouse C2C12 myoblast. These 
data unveil that goat miR-193b-3p promotes myoblast proliferation via activating 
IGF2BP1 by binding to its 3' UTR. Our novel findings highlight the positive 
regulation between miRNA and its target genes in muscle development, which 
further extends the repertoire of miRNA functions."
1767,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is currently regarded as a promising method for the 
treatment of oncological diseases. However, it involves a number of limitations 
related to the specific features of the method and the specific characteristics 
of photosensitizer molecules, including tumor hypoxia, small depth of light 
penetration into the tumor tissue, and low accumulation sensitivity. These 
drawbacks can be overcome by combining PDT with other treatment methods, for 
example, chemotherapy. In this work, we were the first to obtain agents that 
contain bacteriopurpurinimide as a photodynamic subunit and complexes of gold(I) 
that implement the chemotherapy effect. To bind the latter agents, 
N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) based on histidine and histamine were obtained. We 
considered alternative techniques for synthesizing the target conjugates and 
selected an optimal one that enabled the production of preparative amounts for 
biological assays. In vitro studies showed that all the compounds obtained 
exhibited high photoinduced activity. The C-donor Au(I) complexes exhibited the 
maximum specific activity at longer incubation times compared to the other 
derivatives, both under exposure to light and without irradiation. In in vivo 
studies, the presence of histamine in the NHC-derivative of dipropoxy-BPI (7b) 
had no significant effect on its antitumor action, whereas the Au(I) metal 
complex of histamine NHC-derivative with BPI (8b) resulted in enhanced antitumor 
activity and in an increased number of remissions after photodynamic treatment."
1768,"Venous and arterial thromboembolism (VTE/ATE) are common complications in cancer 
patients. Antithrombin deficiency is a risk factor for thrombosis in the general 
population, but its connection to risk of cancer-associated thrombosis is 
unclear. We investigated the association of antithrombin activity levels with 
risk of cancer-associated VTE/ATE and all-cause mortality in an observational 
cohort study including patients with cancer, the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis 
Study. In total, 1127 patients were included (45% female, median age: 62 years). 
Amongst these subjects, 110 (9.7%) patients were diagnosed with VTE, 32 (2.8%) 
with ATE, and 563 (49.9%) died. Antithrombin was not associated with a risk of 
VTE (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR): 1.00 per 1% increase in antithrombin 
level; 95% CI: 0.99-1.01) or ATE (SHR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.98-1.03). However, 
antithrombin showed a u-shaped association with the risk of all-cause death, 
i.e., patients with very low but also very high levels had poorer overall 
survival. In the subgroup of patients with brain tumors, higher antithrombin 
levels were associated with ATE risk (SHR: 1.02 per 1% increase; 95% CI: 
1.00-1.04) and mortality (HR: 1.01 per 1% increase; 95% CI: 1.00-1.02). Both 
high and low antithrombin activity was associated with the risk of death. 
However, no association with cancer-associated VTE and ATE across all cancer 
types was found, with the exception of in brain tumors."
1769,"Stroke and cancer are disabling diseases with an enormous global burden, 
disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and low- and middle-income 
countries. Both these diseases share common risk factors, which warrant 
concerted attention toward reshaping population health approaches and the 
conducting of fundamental studies. In this article, an overview of 
epidemiological trends in the prevalence and burden of cancer and stroke, 
underlying biological mechanisms and clinical risk factors, and various tools 
available for risk prediction and prognosis are provided. Finally, future 
recommendations for research and existing gaps in our understanding of 
pathophysiology. Further research must investigate the causes that predispose 
patients to an increased risk of stroke and/or cancer, as well as biomarkers 
that can be used to predict growing morbidity and mortality."
1770,"A series of novel 1,3,4-oxadiazole-artemisinin hybrids have been designed and 
synthesized. An MTT assay revealed that most of tested hybrids showed more 
enhanced anti-proliferative activities than artemisinin, among which A8 had the 
superior potency with IC50 values ranging from 4.07 μM to 9.71 μM against five 
tested cancer cell lines. Cell colony formation assays showed that A8 could 
inhibit significantly more cell proliferation than artemisinin and 
5-fluorouracil. Further mechanism studies reveal that A8 induces apoptosis and 
ferroptosis in MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and CYPs inhibition 
assays reveal that A8 has a moderate inhibitory effect on CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in 
the human body at 10 μM. The present work indicates that hybrid A8 may merit 
further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent."
1771,"Cancer is one of the deadliest non communicable diseases. Numerous anticancer 
medications have been developed to target the molecular pathways driving cancer. 
However, there has been no discernible increase in the overall survival rate in 
cancer patients. Therefore, innovative chemo-preventive techniques and agents 
are required to supplement standard cancer treatments and boost their efficacy. 
Fruits and vegetables should be tapped into as a source of compounds that can 
serve as cancer therapy. Phytochemicals play an important role as sources of new 
medication in cancer treatment. Some synthetic and natural chemicals are 
effective for cancer chemoprevention, i.e., the use of exogenous medicine to 
inhibit or impede tumor development. They help regulate molecular pathways 
linked to the development and spread of cancer. They can enhance antioxidant 
status, inactivating carcinogens, suppressing proliferation, inducing cell cycle 
arrest and death, and regulating the immune system. While focusing on four main 
categories of plant-based anticancer agents, i.e., epipodophyllotoxin, 
camptothecin derivatives, taxane diterpenoids, and vinca alkaloids and their 
mode of action, we review the anticancer effects of phytochemicals, like 
quercetin, curcumin, piperine, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and gingerol. We 
examine the different signaling pathways associated with cancer and how 
inflammation as a key mechanism is linked to cancer growth."
1772,"AIM: The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs713041, located in the 
regulatory region, is required to incorporate selenium into the selenoprotein 
glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and has been found to have functional 
consequences. This systematic review aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to 
determine whether there is an association between GPX4 (rs713041) SNP and the 
risk of diseases in humans and its correlation with selenium status.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search for English-language manuscripts 
published between January 1990 and November 2022 was carried out using six 
databases: CINAHL, Cochrane, Medline, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to assess a 
relationship between GPX4 (rs713041) SNP and the risk of different diseases 
based on three genetic models. Review Manager 5.4 and Comprehensive 
Meta-Analysis 4 software were used to perform the meta-analysis and carry out 
Egger's test for publication bias.
RESULTS: Data from 21 articles were included in the systematic review. Diseases 
were clustered according to the physiological system affected to understand 
better the role of GPX4 (rs713041) SNP in developing different diseases. 
Carriers of the GPX4 (rs173041) T allele were associated with an increased risk 
of developing colorectal cancer in additive and dominant models (p = 0.02 and p 
= 0.004, respectively). In addition, carriers of the T allele were associated 
with an increased risk of developing stroke and hypertension in the additive, 
dominant and recessive models (p = 0.002, p = 0.004 and p = 0.01, respectively). 
On the other hand, the GPX4 (rs713041) T allele was associated with a decreased 
risk of developing pre-eclampsia in the additive, dominant and recessive models 
(p &lt; 0.0001, p = 0.002 and p = 0.0005, respectively). Moreover, selenium 
levels presented lower mean values in cancer patients relative to control groups 
(SMD = -0.39 µg/L; 95% CI: -0.64, -0.14; p = 0.002, I2 = 85%).
CONCLUSION: GPX4 (rs713041) T allele may influence colorectal cancer risk, 
stroke, hypertension and pre-eclampsia. In addition, low selenium levels may 
play a role in the increased risk of cancer."
1773,"Breast cancer, as a highly heterogeneous malignant tumor, is one of the primary 
causes of death among females worldwide. The etiology of breast cancer involves 
aberrant epigenetic mechanisms and abnormal expression of certain non-coding RNA 
(ncRNAs). DNA methylation, N6-methyladenosine(m6A), and histone methylation are 
widely explored epigenetic regulation types in breast cancer. ncRNAs are a group 
of unique RNA transcripts, mainly including microRNA (miRNAs), long non-coding 
RNA (lncRNAs), circular RNA (circRNAs), small interfering RNA (siRNAs), 
piwi-interacting RNA (piRNAs), etc. Different types of methylation and ncRNAs 
mutually regulate and interact to form intricate networks to mediate precisely 
breast cancer genesis. In this review, we elaborate on the crosstalk between 
major methylation modifications and ncRNAs and discuss the role of their 
interaction in promoting breast cancer oncogenesis. This review can provide 
novel insights into establishing a new diagnostic marker system on methylation 
patterns of ncRNAs and therapeutic perspectives of combining ncRNA 
oligonucleotides and phytochemical drugs for breast cancer therapy."
1774,"Cancers are defined by genetic defects, which underlines the prospect of using 
gene therapy in patient care. During the past decade, CRISPR technology has 
rapidly evolved into a powerful gene editing tool with high fidelity and 
precision. However, one of the impediments slowing down the clinical translation 
of CRISPR-based gene therapy concerns the lack of ideal delivery vectors. 
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized membrane sacs naturally released 
from nearly all types of cells. Although EVs are secreted for bio-information 
conveyance among cells or tissues, they have been recognized as superior vectors 
for drug or gene delivery. Recently, emerging evidence has spotlighted EVs in 
CRISPR delivery towards cancer treatment. In this review, we briefly introduce 
the biology and function of the CRISPR system and follow this with a summary of 
current delivery methods for CRISPR applications. We emphasize the recent 
progress in EV-mediated CRISPR editing for various cancer types and target 
genes. The reported strategies for constructing EV-CRISPR vectors, as well as 
their limitations, are discussed in detail. The review aims to throw light on 
the clinical potential of engineered EVs and encourage the expansion of our 
available toolkit to defeat cancer."
1775,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a high possibility of 
metastasis. M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the main components 
of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and play a key role in TNBC metastasis. 
Therefore, TAMs may be a potential target for reducing TNBC metastasis. 
Melittin-dKLA, a peptide composed of fused melittin and pro-apoptotic peptide 
d(KLAKLAK)2 (dKLA), showed a potent therapeutic effect against cancers by 
depleting TAMs. However, melittin has a strong adverse hemolytic effect. Hence, 
we attempted to improve the therapeutic potential of melittin-dKLA by reducing 
toxicity and increasing stability. Nine truncated melittin fragments were 
synthesized and examined. Of the nine peptides, the melittin-dKLA8-26 showed the 
best binding properties to M2 macrophages and discriminated M0/M1/M2. All 
fragments, except melittin, lost their hemolytic effects. To increase the 
stability of the peptide, melittin-dKLA8-26 fragment was conjugated with 
PEGylation at the amino terminus and was named PEG-melittin-dKLA8-26. This final 
drug candidate was assessed in vivo in a murine TNBC model and showed superior 
effects on tumor growth, survival rates, and lung metastasis compared with the 
previously used melittin-dKLA. Taken together, our study showed that the novel 
PEG-melittin-dKLA8-26 possesses potential as a new drug for treating TNBC and 
TNBC-mediated metastasis by targeting TAMs."
1776,"Flavones are natural phytochemicals broadly distributed in our diet. Their 
anti-inflammatory properties provide unique opportunities to control the innate 
immune system and inflammation. Here, we review the role of flavones in chronic 
inflammation with an emphasis on their impact on the molecular mechanisms 
underlying inflammatory diseases including obesity and cancer. Flavones can 
influence the innate immune cell repertoire restoring the immune landscape. 
Flavones impinge on NF-κB, STAT, COX-2, or NLRP3 inflammasome pathways 
reestablishing immune homeostasis. Devoid of adverse side effects, flavones 
could present alternative opportunities for the treatment and prevention of 
chronic inflammation that contributes to obesity and cancer."
1777,"Globally, there are over half a million new patients with head and neck squamous 
cell carcinomas (HNSCC) every year. The current therapeutic approaches to HNSCC 
are surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. These approaches carry a high incidence 
of metastasis or recurrence from HNSCC cells' radioresistance. Recent studies 
have revealed that a combination with radiosensitizers can be used to improve 
the radioresistance in HNSCC; however, few agents are approved as 
radiosensitizers. The constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase 
(PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a 
vitally oncogenic type of signaling that promotes tumorigenesis, metastasis, and 
radiotherapy resistance in HNSCC. Pharmacological targeting of PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
signaling pathway is considered a promising strategy of radiosensitization in 
HNSCC. In this review, we summarize the oncogenic significance of PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
signaling in HNSCC with radiotherapy resistance and highlight the therapeutic 
potential of small molecule inhibitors against PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling for the 
radiosensitization in HNSCC treatment. It provides a mechanistic framework for 
the development of new drugs for radiosensitization in HNSCC radiotherapy via 
targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway."
1778,"Chrysin is a flavonoid found abundantly in substances, such as honey and 
phytochemicals, and is known to exhibit anticancer effects against various 
cancer cells. Nevertheless, the anticancer effect of chrysin against oral cancer 
has not yet been verified. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying autophagy is 
yet to be clearly elucidated. Thus, this study investigated chrysin-mediated 
apoptosis and autophagy in human mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MC-3) cells. The 
change in MC-3 cell viability was examined using a 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell viability 
assay, as well as 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, annexin V, and propidium iodide 
staining. Western blotting was used to analyze the proteins related to apoptosis 
and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In addition, the 
presence or absence of autophagy and changes in the expression of related 
proteins were investigated using acridine orange staining and Western blot. The 
results suggested that chrysin induced apoptosis and autophagy in MC-3 oral 
cancer cells via the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway. 
Moreover, the induced autophagy exerted a cytoprotective effect against 
apoptosis. Thus, the further reduced cell viability due to autophagy as well as 
apoptosis induction highlight therapeutic potential of chrysin for oral cancer."
1779,"Mitochondria are organelles that play a vital role in cellular survival by 
supplying ATP and metabolic substrates via oxidative phosphorylation and the 
Krebs cycle. Hence, mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to many human 
diseases, including metabolic syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and 
aging. Mitochondrial transfer between cells has been shown to occur naturally, 
and mitochondrial transplantation is beneficial for treating mitochondrial 
dysfunction. In this study, the migration of mitochondria was tracked in vitro 
and in vivo using mitochondria conjugated with green fluorescent protein 
(MTGFP). When MTGFP were used in a coculture model, they were selectively 
internalized into lung fibroblasts, and this selectivity depended on the 
mitochondrial functional states of the receiving fibroblasts. Compared with 
MTGFP injected intravenously into normal mice, MTGFP injected into 
bleomycin-induced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis model mice localized more 
abundantly in the lung tissue, indicating that mitochondrial homing to injured 
tissue occurred. This study shows for the first time that exogenous mitochondria 
are preferentially trafficked to cells and tissues in which mitochondria are 
damaged, which has implications for the delivery of therapeutic agents to 
injured or diseased sites."
1780,"Nanomedicine, being pressured by the increasing demands for fighting menacing 
diseases such as cancer, relies pragmatically on consolidated knowledge, namely 
on therapeutic strategies that are at an advanced stage of experimentation 
[...]."
1781,"Therapeutic options for treating advanced melanoma have progressed rapidly in 
recent decades. Until 6 years ago, the regimen for treating advanced melanoma 
consisted mainly of cytotoxic agents such as dacarbazine and type I interferons. 
Since 2014, anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD1) antibodies have been recognized 
as anchor drugs for treating advanced melanoma, with or without additional 
combination drugs such as ipilimumab, but the efficacies of these 
immunotherapies are not fully satisfactory. In this review, we describe the 
development of the currently available anti-PD1 Abs-based immunotherapies for 
advanced melanoma, focusing on their efficacy and immune-related adverse events 
(AEs), as well as clinical trials still ongoing for the future treatment of 
advanced melanoma."
1782,"Ovarian clear cell carcinomas (OCCs) arise from endometriotic cysts that many 
women develop. Biomarkers for early OCC detection need to be identified. 
Extracellular vesicles have attracted attention as biomarker carriers. This 
study aims to identify cancer-specific miRNAs as novel OCC biomarkers using 
tissue-exudative extracellular vesicles (Te-EVs). Te-EVs were collected from 
four patients with OCC on one side and a normal ovary on the other side. 
Microarray analysis was performed to identify cancer-specific miRNAs in Te-EVs. 
Serum samples obtained before and after surgery from patients with OCC and 
atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) (controls) were compared using real-time 
PCR to examine changes in the detected EV miRNA levels. Thirty-seven miRNAs were 
&gt;2-fold upregulated on the OCC side compared with the normal ovarian side. We 
selected 17 miRNAs and created specific primers for 12 of these miRNAs. The 
levels of six EV miRNAs were significantly decreased in postoperative OCC serum 
compared to those in preoperative OCC serum. In contrast, no significant change 
was observed between the pre and postoperative values in the control group. We 
identified OCC tissue-specific miRNAs in the EVs secreted by OCC tissues. These 
EV miRNAs have potential for use as biomarkers for the early diagnosis and 
detection of OCC."
1783,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a highly complex heterotrimeric Ser/Thr 
phosphatase that regulates many cellular processes. PP2A is dysregulated in 
several human diseases, including oncological pathology; interestingly, PP2A 
appears to be essential for controlling cell growth and may be involved in 
cancer development. The role of PP2A as a tumor suppressor has been extensively 
studied and reviewed. To leverage the potential clinical utility of combination 
PP2A inhibition and radiotherapy treatment, it is vital that novel highly 
specific PP2A inhibitors be developed. In this review, the existing literature 
on the role of PP2A in brain tumors, especially in gliomas and glioblastoma 
(GBM), was analyzed. Interestingly, the review focused on the role of PP2A 
inhibitors, focusing on CIP2A inhibition, as CIP2A participated in tumor cell 
growth by stimulating cell-renewal survival, cellular proliferation, evasion of 
senescence and inhibition of apoptosis. This review suggested CIP2A inhibition 
as a promising strategy in oncology target therapy."
1784,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor. Recently, agents 
increasing the level of oxidative stress have been proposed as anticancer drugs. 
However, their efficacy may be lowered by the cytoprotective activity of 
antioxidant enzymes, often upregulated in neoplastic cells. Here, we assessed 
the mRNA and protein expression of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), a master 
regulator of cellular redox homeostasis, in GBM and non-tumor brain tissues. 
Next, we examined the influence of an inhibitor of TrxR1, auranofin (AF), alone 
or in combination with a prooxidant menadione (MEN), on growth of GBM cell 
lines, patient-derived GBM cells and normal human astrocytes. We detected 
considerable amount of TrxR1 in the majority of GBM tissues. Treatment with AF 
decreased viability of GBM cells and their potential to form colonies and 
neurospheres. Moreover, it increased the intracellular level of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). Pre-treatment with ROS scavenger prevented the AF-induced cell 
death, pointing to the important role of ROS in the reduction of cell viability. 
The cytotoxic effect of AF was potentiated by treatment with MEN. In conclusion, 
our results identify TrxR1 as an attractive drug target and highlights AF as an 
off-patent drug candidate in GBM therapy."
1785,"The purpose of this study was to identify the hub genes and biological pathways 
of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) through bioinformatics analysis and potential 
new therapeutic targets. In this study, three datasets were downloaded from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 
NPC and normal tissues were analyzed using the GEO2R online tool. Volcano and 
heat maps of the DEGs were visualized using the hiplot database. Gene ontology 
(GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment 
analyses of the upregulated and downregulated DEGs were performed using the 
DAVID database. Finally, we established a protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network using the STRING database and showed the differential expression of hub 
genes between the normal and tumor tissues. In all, 109,371,221 upregulated DEGs 
and 139,226,520 downregulated DEGs were obtained in datasets GSE40290, GSE61218, 
and GSE53819, respectively, and 18 common differential genes, named co-DEGs, 
were screened in the three datasets. The most abundant biological GO terms of 
the co-DEGs were inflammatory response et al. The KEGG pathway enrichment 
analysis showed that co-DEGs mainly participated in the interleukin (IL)-17 
signaling pathway et al. Finally, we identified four hub genes using PPI 
analysis and observed that three of them were highly expressed in tumor tissues. 
In this study, the hub genes of NPC, such as PTGS2, and pathways such as IL-17 
signaling, were identified through bioinformatics analysis, which may be 
potential new therapeutic targets for NPC."
1786,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health problem affecting millions of 
people worldwide and leading to death or permanent damage. TBI affects the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis either by primary injury to the 
hypothalamic-hypophyseal region or by secondary vascular damage, brain, and/or 
pituitary edema, vasospasm, and inflammation. Neuroendocrine dysfunctions after 
TBI have been clinically described in all hypothalamic-pituitary axes. We 
established a mild TBI (mTBI) in rats by using the controlled cortical impact 
(CCI) model. The hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenals were collected in the 
acute (24 h) and chronic (30 days) groups after TBI, and we investigated 
transcripts and protein-related autophagy (Lc3, Bcln1, P150, Ulk, and Atg5) and 
apoptosis (pro-caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3). Transcripts related to autophagy 
were reduced in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenals after TBI, however, 
this was not reflected in autophagy-related protein levels. In contrast, protein 
markers related to apoptosis increased in the adrenals during the acute phase 
and in the pituitary during the chronic phase. TBI stresses induce a variation 
of autophagy-related transcripts without modifying the levels of their proteins 
in the HPA axis. In contrast, protein markers related to apoptosis are increased 
in the acute phase in the adrenals, which could lead to impaired communication 
via the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenals. This may then explain the 
permanent pituitary damage with increased apoptosis and inflammation in the 
chronic phase. These results contribute to the elucidation of the mechanisms 
underlying endocrine dysfunctions such as pituitary and adrenal insufficiency 
that occur after TBI. Although the adrenals are not directly affected by TBI, we 
suggest that the role of the adrenals along with the hypothalamus and pituitary 
should not be ignored in the acute phase after TBI."
1787,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly 
contagious and pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 and caused a 
pandemic of respiratory illness termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
Cancer patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The treatment of 
cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is more complicated, and the patients 
are at risk of poor prognosis compared to other populations. Patients infected 
with SARS-CoV-2 are prone to rapid development of acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) of which pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is considered a sequelae. Both 
ARDS and PF are factors that contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. 
However, the molecular mechanisms among COVID-19, ARDS and PF in COVID-19 
patients with cancer are not well-understood. In this study, the common 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between COVID-19 patients with and without 
cancer were identified. Based on the common DEGs, a series of analyses were 
performed, including Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis, protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network construction and hub gene extraction, transcription 
factor (TF)-DEG regulatory network construction, TF-DEG-miRNA coregulatory 
network construction and drug molecule identification. The candidate drug 
molecules (e.g., Tamibarotene CTD 00002527) obtained by this study might be 
helpful for effective therapeutic targets in COVID-19 patients with cancer. In 
addition, the common DEGs among ARDS, PF and COVID-19 patients with and without 
cancer are TNFSF10 and IFITM2. These two genes may serve as potential 
therapeutic targets in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with cancer. Changes 
in the expression levels of TNFSF10 and IFITM2 in CD14+/CD16+ monocytes may 
affect the immune response of COVID-19 patients. Specifically, changes in the 
expression level of TNFSF10 in monocytes can be considered as an immune 
signature in COVID-19 patients with hematologic cancer. Targeting 
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) pathways (e.g., METTL3/SERPINA1 axis) to restrict 
SARS-CoV-2 reproduction has therapeutic potential for COVID-19 patients."
1788,"High-grade brain tumors are malignant tumors with poor survival and remain the 
most difficult tumors to treat. An important contributing factor to the 
development and progression of brain tumors is their ability to evade the immune 
system. Several immunotherapeutic strategies including vaccines and checkpoint 
inhibitors have been studied to improve the effectiveness of the immune system 
in destroying cancer cells. Recent studies have shown that kinase inhibitors, 
capable of inhibiting signal transduction cascades that affect cell 
proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, have additional immunological 
effects. In this review, we explain the beneficial therapeutic effects of novel 
small-molecule kinase inhibitors and explore how, through different mechanisms, 
they increase the protective antitumor immune response in high-grade brain 
tumors."
1789,"Multiple myeloma (MM) has a highly heterogeneous genetic background, which 
complicates its molecular tracking over time. Nevertheless, each MM patient's 
malignant plasma cells (PCs) share unique V(D)J rearranged sequences at 
immunoglobulin loci, which represent ideal disease biomarkers. Because the 
tumor-specific V(D)J sequence is highly expressed in bulk RNA in MM patients, we 
wondered whether it can be identified by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). 
To this end we analyzed CD138+ cells purified from bone marrow aspirates of 19 
samples with PC dyscrasias by both a standard method based on bulk DNA and by an 
implementation of the standard 10x Genomics protocol to detect expressed V(D)J 
sequences. A dominant clonotype was easily identified in each sample, accounting 
on average for 83.65% of V(D)J-rearranged cells. Compared with standard methods, 
scRNA-seq analysis proved highly concordant and even more effective in 
identifying clonal productive rearrangements, by-passing limitations related to 
the misannealing of consensus primers in hypermutated regions. We next validated 
its accuracy to track 5 clonal cells with absolute sensitivity in a virtual 
sample containing 3180 polyclonal cells. This shows that single-cell V(D)J 
analysis may be used to find rare clonal cells, laying the foundations for 
functional single-cell dissection of minimal residual disease."
1790,"Spine tumors represent a significant social and medical problem, affecting the 
quality of life of thousands of patients and imposing a burden on healthcare 
systems worldwide. Encompassing a wide range of diseases, spine tumors require 
prompt multidisciplinary treatment strategies, being mainly approached through 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical interventions, either alone or in 
various combinations. However, these conventional tactics exhibit a series of 
drawbacks (e.g., multidrug resistance, tumor recurrence, systemic adverse 
effects, invasiveness, formation of large bone defects) which limit their 
application and efficacy. Therefore, recent research focused on finding better 
treatment alternatives by utilizing modern technologies to overcome the 
challenges associated with conventional treatments. In this context, the present 
paper aims to describe the types of spine tumors and the most common current 
treatment alternatives, further detailing the recent developments in anticancer 
nanoformulations, personalized implants, and enhanced surgical techniques."
1791,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer diagnosed among women in the world, 
with an ever-increasing incidence rate. Due to the dynamic increase in the 
occurrence of risk factors, including obesity and related metabolic disorders, 
the search for new regulatory mechanisms is necessary. This will help a complete 
understanding of the pathogenesis of breast cancer. The review presents the 
mechanisms of obesity as a factor that increases the risk of developing breast 
cancer and that even initiates the cancer process in the female population. The 
mechanisms presented in the paper relate to the inflammatory process resulting 
from current or progressive obesity leading to cell metabolism disorders and 
disturbed hormonal metabolism. All these processes are widely regulated by the 
action of microRNAs (miRNAs), which may constitute potential biomarkers 
influencing the pathogenesis of breast cancer and may be a promising target of 
anti-cancer therapies."
1792,"The Tyro, Axl, and MerTK receptors (TAMRs) play a significant role in the 
clearance of apoptotic cells. In this work, the spotlight was set on MerTK, as 
it is one of the prominent TAMRs expressed on the surface of macrophages and 
dendritic cells. MerTK-specific antibodies were previously isolated from a 
transgenic rat-derived immune library with suitable biophysical properties. 
Further characterisation resulted in an agonistic MerTK antibody that led to 
phospho AKT activation in a dose-dependent manner. In this proof-of-concept 
study, a MerTK-specific antibody, MerK28, was combined with tandem, biparatopic 
EGFR-binding VHH camelid antibody domains (7D9G) in different architectures to 
generate bispecific antibodies with the capacity to bind EGFR and MerTK 
simultaneously. The bispecific molecules exhibited appropriate binding 
properties with regard to both targets in their soluble forms as well as to 
cells, which resulted in the engagement of macrophage-like THP-1 cells with 
epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. Furthermore, targeted phagocytosis in 
co-culture experiments was observed only with the bispecific variants and not 
the parental MerTK-binding antibody. This work paves the way for the generation 
of bispecific macrophage-engaging antibodies for targeted phagocytosis 
harnessing the immune-modulating roles of MerTK in immunotherapy."
1793,"Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is one of the most aggressive skin tumors with a poor 
prognosis. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of regulated cell death that 
is closely associated with cancer development and immunotherapy. The aim of this 
study was to establish and validate a ferroptosis-related gene (FRG) DNA 
methylation signature to predict the prognosis of CM patients using data from 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A 
reliable four-FRG DNA methylation prognostic signature was constructed via Cox 
regression analysis based on TCGA database. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 
patients in the high-risk group tended to have a shorter overall survival (OS) 
than the low-risk group in both training TCGA and validation GEO cohorts. 
Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed the areas 
under the curve (AUC) at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.738, 0.730, and 0.770 in TCGA 
cohort and 0.773, 0.775, and 0.905 in the validation cohort, respectively. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that the signature 
was an independent prognostic indicator of OS in patients with CM. Immunogenomic 
profiling showed the low-risk group of patients had a higher immunophenoscore, 
and most immune checkpoints were negatively associated with the risk signature. 
Functional enrichment analysis revealed that immune response and immune-related 
pathways were enriched in the low-risk group. In conclusion, we established and 
validated a four-FRG DNA methylation signature that independently predicts 
prognosis in CM patients. This signature was strongly correlated with the immune 
landscape, and may serve as a biomarker to guide clinicians in making more 
precise and personalized treatment decisions for CM patients."
1794,"Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that play diverse roles in numerous normal 
and pathological processes. They are actively used to treat a wide variety of 
diseases, including neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases, cancers, and 
COVID-19, among others. However, the long-term use of glucocorticoids is 
associated with numerous side effects. Molecular mechanisms of these negative 
side effects are not completely understood. Recently, arguments have been made 
that one such mechanisms may be related to the influence of glucocorticoids on 
O-glycosylated components of the cell surface and extracellular matrix, in 
particular on proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. The potential toxic effects 
of glucocorticoids on these glycosylated macromolecules are particularly 
meaningful for brain physiology because proteoglycans/glycosaminoglycans are the 
main extracellular components of brain tissue. Here, we aim to review the known 
effects of glucocorticoids on proteoglycan expression and glycosaminoglycan 
content in different tissues, with a specific focus on the brain."
1795,"Histone deacetylase inhibitors show synergy with several genotoxic drugs. 
Herein, we investigated the biological impact of the combined treatment of 
panobinostat and melphalan in multiple myeloma (MM). DNA damage response (DDR) 
parameters and the expression of DDR-associated genes were analyzed in bone 
marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 
26 newly diagnosed MM patients. PBMCs from 25 healthy controls (HC) were 
examined in parallel. Compared with the ex vivo melphalan-only treatment, 
combined treatment with panobinostat and melphalan significantly reduced the 
efficiency of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and double-strand-break repair 
(DSB/R), enhanced the accumulation of DNA lesions (monoadducts and DSBs), and 
increased the apoptosis rate only in patients' BMPCs (all p &lt; 0.001); 
marginal changes were observed in PBMCs from the same patients or HC. 
Accordingly, panobinostat pre-treatment decreased the expression levels of 
critical NER (DDB2, XPC) and DSB/R (MRE11A, PRKDC/DNAPKc, RAD50, XRCC6/Ku70) 
genes only in patients' BMPCs; no significant changes were observed in PBMCs 
from patients or HC. Together, our findings demonstrate that panobinostat 
significantly increased the melphalan sensitivity of malignant BMPCs without 
increasing the melphalan sensitivity of PBMCs from the same patients, thus 
paving the way for combination therapies in MM with improved anti-myeloma 
efficacy and lower side effects."
1796,"A promise of cancer nanomedicine is the ""targeted"" delivery of therapeutic 
agents to tumors by the rational design of nanostructured materials. During the 
past several decades, a realization that in vitro and in vivo preclinical data 
are unreliable predictors of successful clinical translation has motivated a 
reexamination of this approach. Mathematical models of drug pharmacokinetics 
(PK) and biodistribution (BD) are essential tools for small-molecule drugs 
development. A key assumption underlying these models is that drug-target 
binding kinetics dominate blood clearance, hence recognition by host innate 
immune cells is not explicitly included. Nanoparticles circulating in the blood 
are conspicuous to phagocytes, and inevitable interactions typically trigger 
active biological responses to sequester and remove them from circulation. Our 
recent findings suggest that, instead of referring to nanoparticles as designed 
for active or passive ""tumor targeting"", we ought rather to refer to immune 
cells residing in the tumor microenvironment (TME) as active or passive actors 
in an essentially ""cell-mediated tumor retention"" process that competes with 
active removal by other phagocytes. Indeed, following intravenous injection, 
nanoparticles induce changes in the immune compartment of the TME because of 
nanoparticle uptake, irrespective of the nature of tumor targeting moieties. In 
this study, we propose a 6-compartment PK model as an initial mathematical 
framework for modeling this tumor-associated immune cell-mediated retention. 
Published in vivo PK and BD results obtained with bionized nanoferrite® (BNF®) 
nanoparticles were combined with results from in vitro internalization 
experiments with murine macrophages to guide simulations. As a preliminary 
approximation, we assumed that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are solely 
responsible for active retention in the TME. We model the TAM approximation by 
relating in vitro macrophage uptake to an effective macrophage avidity term for 
the BNF® nanoparticles under consideration."
1797,"Two novel fluorescent mesoporous silica-based hybrid materials were obtained 
through the covalent grafting of [4-hydrazinyl-7-nitrobenz-[2,1,3-d]-oxadiazole 
(NBDH) and N1-(7-nitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]-oxadiazol-4-yl) benzene-1,2-diamine 
(NBD-PD), respectively, inside the channels of mesoporous silica SBA-15. The 
presence of fluorescent organic compounds (nitrobenzofurazan derivatives) was 
confirmed by infrared spectroscopy (IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), 
thermal analysis (TG), and fluorescence spectroscopy. The nitrogen physisorption 
analysis showed that the nitrobenzofurazan derivatives were distributed 
uniformly on the internal surface of SBA-15, the immobilization process having a 
negligible effect on the structure of the support. Their antioxidant activity 
was studied by measuring the ability to reduce free radicals DPPH (free radical 
scavenging activity), in order to formulate potential applications of the 
materials obtained. Cytotoxicity of the newly synthesized materials, SBA-NBDH 
and SBA-NBD-PD, was evaluated on human B16 melanoma cells. The morphology of 
these cells, internalization and localization of the investigated materials in 
melanoma and fibroblast cells were examined through fluorescence imaging. The 
viability of B16 (3D) spheroids after treatment with SBA-NBDH and SBA-NBD-PD was 
evaluated using MTS assay. The results showed that both materials induced a 
selective antiproliferative effect, reducing to various degrees the viability of 
melanoma cells. The observed effect was enhanced with increasing concentration. 
SBA-NBD-PD exhibited a higher antitumor effect compared to SBA-NBDH starting 
with a concentration of 125 µg/mL. In both cases, a significantly more 
pronounced antiproliferative effect on tumor cells compared to normal cells was 
observed. The viability of B16 spheroids dropped by 40% after treatment with 
SBA-NBDH and SBA-NBD-PD at 500 µg/mL concentration, indicating a clear cytotoxic 
effect of the tested compounds. These results suggest that both newly 
synthesized biomaterials could be promising antitumor agents for applications in 
cancer therapy."
1798,"Herein, we developed a dual-activated prodrug, BTC, that contains three 
functional components: a glutathione (GSH)-responsive BODIPY-based 
photosensitizer with a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) effect between 
BODIPY and the 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonate (DNBS) group, and an ROS-responsive 
thioketal linker connecting BODIPY and the chemotherapeutic agent camptothecin 
(CPT). Interestingly, CPT displayed low toxicity because the active site of CPT 
was modified by the BODIPY-based macrocycle. Additionally, BTC was encapsulated 
with the amphiphilic polymer DSPE-mPEG2000 to improve drug solubility and tumor 
selectivity. The resulting nano-prodrug passively targeted tumor cells through 
enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects, and then the photosensitizing 
ability of the BODIPY dye was restored by removing the DNBS group with the high 
concentration of GSH in tumor cells. Light-triggered ROS from activated BODIPY 
can not only induce apoptosis or necrosis of tumor cells but also sever the 
thioketal linker to release CPT, achieving the combination treatment of 
selective photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. The antitumor activity of the 
prodrug has been demonstrated in mouse mammary carcinoma 4T1 and human breast 
cancer MCF-7 cell lines and 4T1 tumor-bearing mice."
1799,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) protein regulates normal bone, with 
anti-tumour roles in bone and breast cancer (BC). Pre- and post-menopausal 
oestrogen levels may regulate PEDF expression and function in BC, though the 
mechanisms behind this remain unknown. In this study, in vitro models simulating 
pre- and post-menopausal bone microenvironments were used to evaluate if PEDF 
regulates pro-metastatic biomarker expression and downstream functional effects 
on BC cells. PEDF treatment reduced phosphorylated-nuclear factor-κB p65 subunit 
(p-NFκB-p65), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα), C-X-C chemokine receptor type-4 
(CXCR4), and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) in oestrogen 
receptor (ER)+/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)- BC cells under 
post-menopausal oestrogen conditions. In triple negative BC (TNBC) cells, PEDF 
treatment reduced pNFκB-p65 and uPAR expression under pre-menopausal oestrogen 
conditions. A potential reciprocal regulatory axis between p-NFκB-65 and PEDF in 
BC was identified, which was BC subtype-specific and differentially regulated by 
menopausal oestrogen conditions. The effects of PEDF treatment and NFκB 
inhibition on BC cell function under menopausal conditions were also compared. 
PEDF treatment exhibited superior anti-viability effects, while combined PEDF 
and NFκB-p65 inhibitor treatment was superior in reducing BC cell colony 
formation in a subtype-specific manner. Lastly, immunohistochemical evaluation 
of p-NFκB-p65 and PEDF expression in human BC and bone metastases specimens 
revealed an inverse correlation between nuclear PEDF and NFκB expression in bone 
metastases. We propose that menopausal status is associated with a PEDF/NFκB 
reciprocal regulatory axis, which drives PEDF expression and anti-metastatic 
function in a subtype-specific manner. Altogether, our findings identify 
pre-menopausal TNBC and post-menopausal ER+/HER2- BC patients as target 
populations for future PEDF research."
1800,"(1) BRAF mutations are associated with high mortality and are a substantial 
factor in therapeutic decisions. Therapies targeting BRAF-mutated tumors, such 
as vemurafenib (PLX), have significantly improved the overall survival of 
melanoma patients. However, patient relapse and low response rates remain 
challenging, even with contemporary therapeutic alternatives. Highly 
proliferative tumors often rely on glycolysis to sustain their aggressive 
phenotype. 3-bromopyruvate (3BP) is a promising glycolysis inhibitor reported to 
mitigate resistance in tumors. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of 3BP 
as an antineoplastic agent for PLX-resistant melanoma treatment. (2) The effect 
of 3BP alone or in combination with PLX on viability, proliferation, colony 
formation, cell death, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal marker and 
metabolic protein expression, extracellular glucose and lactate, and reactive 
species were evaluated in two PLX-resistant melanoma cell lines. (3) 3BP 
treatment, which was more effective as monotherapy than combined with PLX, 
disturbed the metabolic and epithelial-mesenchymal profile of PLX-resistant 
cells, impairing their proliferation, migration, and invasion and triggering 
cell death. (4) 3BP monotherapy is a potent metabolic-disrupting agent against 
PLX-resistant melanomas, supporting the suppression of the malignant phenotype 
in this type of neoplasia."
1801,"The forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors (TFs) family are frequently 
mutated, deleted, or amplified in various human cancers, making them attractive 
candidates for therapy. However, their roles in pan-cancer remain unclear. Here, 
we evaluated the expression, prognostic value, mutation, methylation, and 
clinical features of four FOXO family genes (FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6) in 
33 types of cancers based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype Tissue 
Expression (GTEx) databases. We used a single sample gene set enrichment 
analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm to establish a novel index called ""FOXOs score"". 
Moreover, we investigated the association between the FOXOs score and tumor 
microenvironment (TME), the responses to multiple treatments, along with drug 
resistance. We found that the FOXO family genes participated in tumor 
progression and were related to the prognosis in various types of cancer. We 
calculated the FOXOs score and found that it was significantly correlated with 
multiple malignant pathways in pan-cancer, including Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, 
TGF-beta signaling, and hedgehog signaling. In addition, the FOXOs score was 
also associated with multiple immune-related characteristics. Furthermore, the 
FOXOs score was sensitive for predicting the efficacy of diverse treatments in 
multiple cancers, especially immunotherapy. In conclusion, FOXO family genes 
were vital in pan-cancer and were strongly correlated with the TME. A high FOXOs 
score indicated an excellent immune-activated TME and sensitivity to multiple 
treatments. Hence, the FOXOs score might potentially be used as a biomarker in 
patients with a tumor."
1802,"Chemokines and their receptors participate in many biological processes, 
including the modulation of neuroimmune interactions. Approximately fifty 
chemokines are distinguished in humans, which are classified into four 
subfamilies based on the N-terminal conserved cysteine motifs: CXC, CC, C, and 
CX3C. Chemokines activate specific receptors localized on the surface of various 
immune and nervous cells. Approximately twenty chemokine receptors have been 
identified, and each of these receptors is a seven-transmembrane G-protein 
coupled receptor. Recent studies provide new evidence that CC chemokine receptor 
4 (CCR4) is important in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as diabetes, 
multiple sclerosis, asthma, dermatitis, and cancer. This review briefly 
characterizes CCR4 and its ligands (CCL17, CCL22, and CCL2), and their 
contributions to immunological and neoplastic diseases. The review notes a 
significant role of CCR4 in nociceptive transmission, especially in painful 
neuropathy, which accompanies many diseases. The pharmacological blockade of 
CCR4 seems beneficial because of its pain-relieving effects and its influence on 
opioid efficacy. The possibilities of using the CCL2/CCL17/CCL22/CCR4 axis as a 
target in new therapies for many diseases are also discussed."
1803,"Hodgkin lymphomas (HLs) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoid neoplasia 
associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV, considered to be an 
important etiological co-factor in approximately 1% of human malignancies, can 
be classified into two genotypes based on EBNA-2, EBNA-3A and EBNA-3C sequences, 
and into genetic variants based on the sequence variation of the gene coding for 
the LMP1 protein. Here, we present the results on the distribution of EBV 
genotypes 1 and 2 as well as LMP1 gene variants in 50 patients with EBV-positive 
classical HL selected from a cohort of 289 histologically verified cases 
collected over a 9-year period in a tertiary clinical center in the Southeast of 
Europe. The population-based sequencing of the EBNA-3C gene showed the exclusive 
presence of EBV genotype 1 in all cHL samples. The analysis of EBV LMP1 variant 
distribution showed a predominance of the wild-type strain B95-8 and the 
Mediterranean subtype with 30 bp deletion. These findings could contribute to 
the understanding of EBV immunobiology in cHL as well as to the development of a 
prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine."
1804,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the major leading causes of death in 
humans globally. Recently, increased levels of recruited macrophages and 
AGE-albumin were observed in the hearts of humans and animals with acute 
myocardial infarction. Thus, the purposes of this study were to investigate 
whether the elevated levels of AGE-albumin from activated macrophage cells are 
implicated in ischemia-induced cardiomyocyte death and to develop therapeutic 
strategies for AMI based on its underlying molecular mechanisms with respect to 
AGEs. The present study demonstrated that activated macrophages and AGE-albumin 
were observed in heart tissues obtained from humans and rats with AMI 
incidences. In the cellular model of AMI, it was found that increased expression 
of AGE-albumin was shown to be co-localized with macrophages, and the presence 
of AGE-albumin led to increased expression of RAGE through the mitogen-activated 
protein kinase pathway. After revealing cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by 
toxicity of the AGE-RAGE system, sRAGE-secreting MSCs were generated using the 
CRISPR/Cas9 platform to investigate the therapeutic effects of sRAGE-MSCs in an 
AMI rat model. Gene-edited sRAGE-MSCs showed greater therapeutic effects against 
AMI pathogenesis in rat models compared to mock MSCs, and promising results of 
the functional improvement of stem cells could result in significant 
improvements in the clinical management of cardiovascular diseases."
1805,"An association between the BRAFV600E mutation and the clinicopathological 
progression of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) has been suggested. We 
aimed to summarize the relevant literature and determine the predictive value of 
BRAFV600E mutation in predicting clinical outcomes and risk stratification in 
patients with PTMC. A systematic search using PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase up to 
February 2020 was performed. A total of 33 studies met the inclusion criteria, 
resulting in a pool of 8838 patients, of whom 5043 (57.1%) patients were 
positive for BRAFV600E mutation. Tumors with positive BRAFV600E mutation had a 
higher tendency for multifocality (RR = 1.09, 95%CI = 1.03-1.16), extrathyroidal 
extension (RR = 1.79, 95%CI = 1.37-2.32), and lymph node metastasis (RR = 1.43, 
95%CI = 1.19-1.71). Patients with BRAFV600E mutation were at increased risk of 
disease recurrence (RR = 1.90, 95%CI = 1.43-2.53). PTMC in patients positive for 
the BRAFV600E mutation is more aggressive than wild-type BRAF PTMC. Since 
BRAF-mutated PTMC is generally more resistant to radioiodine treatment, patients 
with BRAFV600E-mutated PTMC may require earlier management, such as a minimally 
invasive ablative intervention. Conservative management by active surveillance 
may be suitable for patients with wild-type BRAFV600E PTMC."
1806,"Self-replicating RNA viruses have become attractive delivery vehicles for 
therapeutic applications. They are easy to handle, can be rapidly produced in 
large quantities, and can be delivered as recombinant viral particles, naked or 
nanoparticle-encapsulated RNA, or plasmid DNA-based vectors. The 
self-replication of RNA in infected host cells provides the means for generating 
much higher transgene expression levels and the possibility to apply 
substantially reduced amounts of RNA to achieve similar expression levels or 
immune responses compared to conventional synthetic mRNA. Alphaviruses and 
flaviviruses, possessing a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity, as 
well as measles viruses and rhabdoviruses with a negative-stranded RNA genome, 
have frequently been utilized for therapeutic applications. Both naturally and 
engineered oncolytic self-replicating RNA viruses providing specific replication 
in tumor cells have been evaluated for cancer therapy. Therapeutic efficacy has 
been demonstrated in animal models. Furthermore, the safe application of 
oncolytic viruses has been confirmed in clinical trials. Multiple myeloma 
patients treated with an oncolytic measles virus (MV-NIS) resulted in increased 
T-cell responses against the measles virus and several tumor-associated antigen 
responses and complete remission in one patient. Furthermore, MV-CEA 
administration to patients with ovarian cancer resulted in a stable disease and 
more than doubled the median overall survival."
1807,"Biologically active taxanes, present in small- to medium-sized evergreen 
conifers of various Taxus species, are widely used for their antioxidant, 
antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, but mostly for their antitumour 
effects used in the treatment of solid tumours of the breast, ovary, lung, 
bladder, prostate, oesophagus and melanoma. More of the substances found in 
Taxus plant extracts have medical potential. Therefore, at the beginning of this 
review, we describe the methods of isolation, identification and determination 
of taxanes in different plant parts. One of the most important taxanes is 
paclitaxel, for which we summarize the pharmacokinetic parameters of its 
different formulations. We also describe toxicological risks during clinical 
therapy such as hypersensitivity, neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal, 
cardiovascular, haematological, skin and renal toxicity and toxicity to the 
respiratory system. Since the effect of the drug-form PTX is enhanced by various 
Taxus spp. extracts, we summarize published clinical intoxications and all fatal 
poisonings for the Taxus baccata plant. This showed that, despite their 
significant use in anticancer treatment, attention should also be focused on the 
risk of fatal intoxication due to ingestion of extracts from these plants, which 
are commonly found in our surroundings."
1808,"Evidence is accumulating that the tumour microenvironment (TME) has a key role 
in the progression of gliomas. Non-neoplastic cells in addition to the tumour 
cells are therefore finding increasing attention. Microglia and other 
glioma-associated macrophages are at the centre of this interest especially in 
the context of therapeutic considerations. New ideas have emerged regarding the 
role of microglia and, more recently, blood-derived brain macrophages in 
glioblastoma (GBM) progression. We are now beginning to understand the 
mechanisms that allow malignant glioma cells to weaken microglia and brain 
macrophage defence mechanisms. Surface molecules and cytokines have a prominent 
role in microglia/macrophage-glioma cell interactions, and we discuss them in 
detail. The involvement of exosomes and microRNAs forms another focus of this 
review. In addition, certain microglia and glioma cell pathways deserve special 
attention. These ""synergistic"" (we suggest calling them ""Janus"") pathways are 
active in both glioma cells and microglia/macrophages where they act in concert 
supporting malignant glioma progression. Examples include CCN4 (WISP1)/Integrin 
α6β1/Akt and CHI3L1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR. They represent attractive therapeutic 
targets."
1809,"Recently it has been reported that the tumor adjacent colon tissues of 
1,2-dymethylhydrazine induced (DMH)-rats revealed a high paracellular 
permeability. We hypothesized that the changes might be induced by cytokines. 
Colorectal cancer is accompanied by an increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNFα) and interleukin 10 (IL10) that exert opposite regulatory effects on 
barrier properties of the colon, which is characterized by morphological and 
functional segmental heterogeneity. The aim of this study was to analyze the 
level of TNFα and IL10 in the colon segments of DMH-rats and to investigate 
their effects on barrier properties of the proximal and distal parts of the 
colon in healthy rats. Enzyme immunoassay analysis showed decreased TNFα in 
tumors in the distal part of the colon and increased IL10 in proximal tumors and 
in non-tumor tissues. Four-hour intraluminal exposure of the colon of healthy 
rats with cytokines showed reduced colon barrier function dependent on the 
cytokine: TNFα decreased it mainly in the distal part of the colon, whereas IL10 
decreased it only in the proximal part. Western blot analysis revealed a more 
pronounced influence of IL10 on tight junction (TJ) proteins expression by 
down-regulation of the TJ proteins claudin-1, -2 and -4, and up-regulation of 
occludin only in the proximal part of the colon. These data may indicate a 
selective role of the cytokines in regulation of the barrier properties of the 
colon and a prominent role of IL10 in carcinogenesis in its proximal part."
1810,"Modeling ionizing radiation interaction with biological matter is a major 
scientific challenge, especially for protons that are nowadays widely used in 
cancer treatment. That presupposes a sound understanding of the mechanisms that 
take place from the early events of the induction of DNA damage. Herein, we 
present results of irradiation-induced complex DNA damage measurements using 
plasmid pBR322 along a typical Proton Treatment Plan at the MedAustron proton 
and carbon beam therapy facility (energy 137-198 MeV and Linear Energy Transfer 
(LET) range 1-9 keV/μm), by means of Agarose Gel Electrophoresis and DNA 
fragmentation using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The induction rate Mbp-1 Gy-1 
for each type of damage, single strand breaks (SSBs), double-strand breaks 
(DSBs), base lesions and non-DSB clusters was measured after irradiations in 
solutions with varying scavenging capacity containing 
2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol (Tris) and coumarin-3-carboxylic acid 
(C3CA) as scavengers. Our combined results reveal the determining role of LET 
and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, AFM used to 
measure apparent DNA lengths provided us with insights into the role of 
increasing LET in the induction of highly complex DNA damage."
1811,"This study evaluated the mechanism of temperature-controlled repeated thermal 
stimulation (TRTS)-mediated neuronal differentiation. We assessed the effect of 
SP600125, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, on neuronal differentiation 
of rat PC12-P1F1 cells, which can differentiate into neuron-like cells by 
exposure to TRTS or neurotrophic factors, including bone morphogenetic protein 
(BMP) 4. We evaluated neuritogenesis by incubating the cells under conditions of 
TRTS and/or SP600125. Cotreatment with SP600125 significantly enhanced 
TRTS-mediated neuritogenesis, whereas that with other selective 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors did not-e.g., extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 inhibitor U0126, and p38 MAPK inhibitor 
SB203580. We tried to clarify the mechanism of SP600125 action by testing the 
effect of U0126 and the BMP receptor inhibitor LDN193189 on the 
SP600125-mediated enhancement of intracellular signaling. SP600125-enhanced 
TRTS-induced neuritogenesis was significantly inhibited by U0126 or LDN193189. 
Gene expression analysis revealed that TRTS significantly increased β3-Tubulin, 
MKK3, and Smad7 gene expressions. Additionally, Smad6 and Smad7 gene expressions 
were substantially attenuated through SP600125 co-treatment during TRTS. 
Therefore, SP600125 may partly enhance TRTS-induced neuritogenesis by 
attenuating the negative feedback loop of BMP signaling. Further investigation 
of the mechanisms underlying the effect of SP600125 during TRTS-mediated 
neuritogenesis may contribute to the future development of regenerative 
neuromedicine."
1812,"Fatty acid synthase (FASN) promotes tumor progression in multiple cancers. In 
this study, we comprehensively examined the expression, prognostic significance, 
and promoter methylation of FASN, and its correlation with immune cell 
infiltration in pan-cancer. Our results demonstrated that elevated FASN 
expression was significantly associated with an unfavorable prognosis in many 
cancer types. Furthermore, FASN promoter DNA methylation can be used as a tumor 
prognosis marker. Importantly, high levels of FASN were significantly negatively 
correlated with tumor immune infiltration in 35 different cancers. Additionally, 
FASN was significantly associated with tumor mutational burden (TMB) and 
microsatellite instability (MSI) in multiple malignancies, suggesting that it 
may be essential for tumor immunity. We also investigated the effects of FASN 
expression on immunotherapy efficacy and prognosis. In up to 15 tumors, it was 
significantly negatively correlated with immunotherapy-related genes, such as 
PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4. Moreover, we found that tumors with high FASN 
expression may be more sensitive to immunotherapy and have a good prognosis with 
PD-L1 treatment. Finally, we confirmed the tumor-suppressive effect of 
mir-195-5p through FASN. Altogether, our results suggested that FASN may serve 
as a novel prognostic indicator and immunotherapeutic target in various 
malignancies."
1813,"Despite the current developments in cancer therapeutics, efforts to excavate new 
anticancer agents continue rigorously due to obstacles, such as side effects and 
drug resistance. Anticancer peptides (ACPs) can be utilized to treat cancer 
because of their effectiveness on a variety of molecular targets, along with 
high selectivity and specificity for cancer cells. In the present study, a novel 
ACP was de novo designed using in silico methods, and its functionality and 
molecular mechanisms of action were explored. AC-P19M was discovered through 
functional prediction and sequence modification based on peptide sequences 
currently available in the database. The peptide exhibited anticancer activity 
against lung cancer cells, A549 and H460, by disrupting cellular membranes and 
inducing apoptosis while showing low toxicity towards normal and red blood 
cells. In addition, the peptide inhibited the migration and invasion of lung 
cancer cells and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, AC-P19M 
showed anti-angiogenic activity through the inhibition of vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor 2 signaling. Our findings suggest that AC-P19M is a novel 
ACP that directly or indirectly targets cancer cells, demonstrating the 
potential development of an anticancer agent and providing insights into the 
discovery of functional substances based on an in silico approach."
1814,"The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor (VEGFR) axis is indispensable in the process of angiogenesis and has 
been implicated as a key driver of tumor vascularization. Consequently, several 
strategies that target VEGF and its cognate receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, have 
been designed to treat cancer. While therapies targeting full-length VEGF have 
resulted in an improvement in both overall survival and progression-free 
survival in various cancers, these benefits have been modest. In addition, the 
inhibition of VEGFRs is associated with undesirable off-target effects. 
Moreover, VEGF splice variants that modulate sprouting and non-sprouting 
angiogenesis have been identified in recent years. Cues within the tumor 
microenvironment determine the expression patterns of these variants. Noteworthy 
is that the mechanisms of action of these variants challenge the established 
norm of VEGF signaling. Furthermore, the aberrant expression of some of these 
variants has been observed in several cancers. Herein, developments in the 
understanding of the VEGF/VEGFR axis and the splice products of these molecules, 
as well as the environmental cues that regulate these variants are reviewed. 
Furthermore, strategies that incorporate the targeting of VEGF variants to 
enhance the effectiveness of antiangiogenic therapies in the clinical setting 
are discussed."
1815,"Tumours are complex systems with dynamic interactions between tumour cells, 
non-tumour cells, and extracellular components that comprise the tumour 
microenvironment (TME). The majority of TME's cells are cancer-associated 
fibroblasts (CAFs), which are crucial in extracellular matrix (ECM) 
construction, tumour metabolism, immunology, adaptive chemoresistance, and 
tumour cell motility. CAF subtypes have been identified based on the expression 
of protein markers. CAFs may act as promoters or suppressors in tumour cells 
depending on a variety of factors, including cancer stage. Indeed, CAFs have 
been shown to promote tumour growth, survival and spread, and secretome changes, 
but they can also slow tumourigenesis at an early stage through mechanisms that 
are still poorly understood. Stromal-cancer interactions are governed by a 
variety of soluble factors that determine the outcome of the tumourigenic 
process. Cancer cells release factors that enhance the ability of fibroblasts to 
secrete multiple tumour-promoting chemokines, acting on malignant cells to 
promote proliferation, migration, and invasion. This crosstalk between CAFs and 
tumour cells has given new prominence to the stromal cells, from being 
considered as mere physical support to becoming key players in the tumour 
process. Here, we focus on the concept of cancer as a non-healing wound and the 
relevance of chronic inflammation to tumour initiation. In addition, we review 
CAFs heterogeneous origins and markers together with the potential therapeutic 
implications of CAFs ""re-education"" and/or targeting tumour progression 
inhibition."
1816,"Since the 2000s, an increasing number of new psychoactive substances (NPS) have 
appeared on the drug market. Arylcyclohexylamine (ACH) compounds such as 
ketamine, phencyclidine and eticyclidine derivatives are of particular concern, 
given their rapidly increasing use and the absence of detailed toxicity data. 
First used mainly for their pharmacological properties in anesthesia, their 
recreational use is increasing. ACH derivatives have an antagonistic activity 
against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, which leads to dissociative effects 
(dissociation of body and mind). Synthetic ketamine derivatives produced in Asia 
are now arriving in Europe, where most are not listed as narcotics and are, 
thus, legal. These structural derivatives have pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic properties that are sometimes very different from ketamine. 
Here, we describe the pharmacology, epidemiology, chemistry and metabolism of 
ACH derivatives, and we review the case reports on intoxication."
1817,"Different gold nanosystems covered with DNA and doxorubicin (Doxo) were designed 
and synthesized for cancer therapy, starting from Au@16-Ph-16 cationic 
nanoparticles and DNA-Doxo complexes prepared under saturation conditions. For 
the preparation of stable, biocompatible, and small-sized compacted 
Au@16-Ph-16/DNA-Doxo nanotransporters, the conditions for the DNA-Doxo 
compaction process induced by gold nanoparticles were first explored using 
fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism and atomic force microscopy 
techniques. The reverse process, which is fundamental for Doxo liberation at the 
site of action, was found to occur at higher CAu@16-Ph-16 concentrations using 
these techniques. Zeta potential, dynamic light scattering and UV-visible 
spectroscopy reveal that the prepared compacted nanosystems are stable, highly 
charged and of adequate size for the effective delivery of Doxo to the cell. 
This fact is verified by in vitro biocompatibility and internalization studies 
using two prostate cancer-derived cell lines (LNCaP and DU145) and one 
hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell line (SNU-387), as well as a non-tumor 
prostate (PNT2) cell line and a non-hepatocarcinoma hepatoblastoma cell line 
(Hep-G2) model used as a control in liver cells. However, the most outstanding 
results of this work are derived from the use of the CI+NI combined treatments 
which present strong action in cancer-derived cell lines, while a protective 
effect is observed in non-tumor cell lines. Hence, novel therapeutic targets 
based on gold nanoparticles denote high selectivity compared to conventional 
treatment based on free Doxo at the same concentration. The results obtained 
show the viability of both the proposed methodology for internalization of 
compacted nanocomplexes inside the cell and the effectiveness of the possible 
treatment and minimization of side effects in prostate and liver cancer."
1818,"Galectins are a family of ß-galactoside-binding proteins that play a variety of 
roles in normal physiology. In cancer, their expression levels are typically 
elevated and often associated with poor prognosis. They are known to fuel a 
variety of cancer progression pathways through their glycan-binding interactions 
with cancer, stromal, and immune cell surfaces. Of the 15 galectins in mammals, 
galectin (Gal)-1, -3, and -9 are particularly notable for their critical roles 
in tumor immune escape. While these galectins play integral roles in promoting 
cancer progression, they are also instrumental in regulating the survival, 
differentiation, and function of anti-tumor T cells that compromise anti-tumor 
immunity and weaken novel immunotherapies. To this end, there has been a surge 
in the development of new strategies to inhibit their pro-malignancy 
characteristics, particularly in reversing tumor immunosuppression through 
galectin-glycan ligand-targeting methods. This review examines some new 
approaches to evading Gal-1, -3, and -9-ligand interactions to interfere with 
their tumor-promoting and immunoregulating activities. Whether using 
neutralizing antibodies, synthetic peptides, glyco-metabolic modifiers, 
competitive inhibitors, vaccines, gene editing, exo-glycan modification, or 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, these methods offer new hope of 
synergizing their inhibitory effects with current immunotherapeutic methods and 
yielding highly effective, durable responses."
1819,"ONC201, the anticancer drug, targets and activates mitochondrial ATP-dependent 
caseinolytic peptidase P (ClpP), a serine protease located in the mitochondrial 
matrix. Given the promise of ONC201 in cancer treatment, we evaluated its 
effects on the breast ductal carcinoma cell line (BT474). We showed that the 
transient single-dose treatment of BT474 cells by 10 µM ONC201 for a period of 
less than 48 h induced a reversible growth arrest and a transient activation of 
an integrated stress response indicated by an increased expression of CHOP, 
ATF4, and GDF-15, and a reduced number of mtDNA nucleoids. A prolonged exposure 
to the drug (&gt;48 h), however, initiated an irreversible loss of mtDNA, 
persistent activation of integrated stress response proteins, as well as cell 
cycle arrest, inhibition of proliferation, and suppression of the intrinsic 
apoptosis pathway. Since Natural Killer (NK) cells are quickly gaining momentum 
in cellular anti-cancer therapies, we evaluated the effect of ONC201 on the 
activity of the peripheral blood derived NK cells. We showed that following the 
ONC 201 exposure BT474 cells demonstrated enhanced sensitivity toward human NK 
cells that mediated killing. Together our data revealed that the effects of a 
single dose of ONC201 are dependent on the duration of exposure, specifically, 
while short-term exposure led to reversible changes; long-term exposure resulted 
in irreversible transformation of cells associated with the senescent phenotype. 
Our data further demonstrated that when used in combination with NK cells, 
ONC201 created a synergistic anti-cancer effect, thus suggesting its possible 
benefit in NK-cell based cellular immunotherapies for cancer treatment."
1820,"Vaults are protein nanoparticles that are found in almost all eukaryotic cells 
but are absent in prokaryotic ones. Due to their properties (nanometric size, 
biodegradability, biocompatibility, and lack of immunogenicity), vaults show 
enormous potential as a bio-inspired, self-assembled drug-delivery system (DDS). 
Vault architecture is directed by self-assembly of the ""major vault protein"" 
(MVP), the main component of this nanoparticle. Recombinant expression (in 
different eukaryotic systems) of the MVP resulted in the formation of 
nanoparticles that were indistinguishable from native vaults. Nowadays, 
recombinant vaults for different applications are routinely produced in insect 
cells and purified by successive ultracentrifugations, which are both tedious 
and time-consuming strategies. To offer cost-efficient and faster protocols for 
nanoparticle production, we propose the production of vault-like nanoparticles 
in Escherichia coli cells, which are still one of the most widely used 
prokaryotic cell factories for recombinant protein production. The strategy 
proposed allowed for the spontaneous encapsulation of the engineered cargo 
protein within the self-assembled vault-like nanoparticles by simply mixing the 
clarified lysates of the producing cells. Combined with well-established 
affinity chromatography purification methods, our approach contains faster, 
cost-efficient procedures for biofabrication in a well-known microbial cell 
factory and the purification of ""ready-to-use"" loaded protein nanoparticles, 
thereby opening the way to faster and easier engineering and production of 
vault-based DDSs."
1821,"Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy has proven to be 
effective in lung cancer treatment, it may not be sufficient to fully activate 
the antitumor immune response. Here, we investigated whether entinostat, a 
histone deacetylase inhibitor, could improve the efficacy of radiotherapy and 
anti-PD-1 in a murine syngeneic LL/2 tumor model. A total of 12 Gy of X-rays 
administered in two fractions significantly delayed tumor growth in mice, which 
was further enhanced by oral entinostat administration. Flow cytometry-aided 
immune cell profiling revealed that entinostat increased radiation-induced 
infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CD8+ T cells with decreased 
regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Transcriptomics-based immune phenotype prediction 
showed that entinostat potentiated radiation-activated pathways, such as 
JAK/STAT3/interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and PD-1/PD-L1 signaling. Entinostat 
augmented the antitumor efficacy of radiation and anti-PD-1, which may be 
related to an increase in IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T-cells with a decrease in Treg 
cells. Comparative transcriptomic profiling predicted that entinostat increased 
the number of dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells in tumors treated with 
radiation and anti-PD-1 by inducing MHC-II genes. In conclusion, our findings 
provided insights into how entinostat improves the efficacy of ionizing 
radiation plus anti-PD-1 therapy and offered clues for developing new strategies 
for clinical trials."
1822,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Microbiome has been shown to affect tumorigenesis by 
promoting inflammation. However, the association between the upper aerodigestive 
microbiome and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is not well 
established. Hypoxia is a modifiable factor associated with poor radiation 
response. Our study analyzed the HNSCC tumor samples from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) to investigate the relationship between different HNSCC tumor 
subsites, hypoxia, and local tumor microbiome composition.
RESULTS: A total of 357 patients were included [Oral cavity (OC) = 226, 
Oropharynx (OPx) = 53, and Larynx/Hypopharynx (LHPx) = 78], of which 12.8%, 
71.7%, and 10.3%, respectively, were HPV positive. The mean (SD) hypoxia scores 
were 30.18 (11.10), 24.31 (14.13), and 29.53 (12.61) in OC, OPx, and LHPx 
tumors, respectively, with higher values indicating greater hypoxia. The hypoxia 
score was significantly higher for OC tumors compared to OPx (p = 0.044) and 
LHPx (p = 0.002). There was no significant correlation between hypoxia and HPV 
status. Pseudomonas sp. in OC, Actinomyces sp. and Sulfurimonas sp. in OPx, and 
Filifactor, Pseudomonas and Actinomyces sp. in LHPx had the strongest 
association with the hypoxia score.
MATERIALS/METHODS: Tumor RNAseq samples from TCGA were processed, and the R 
package ""tmesig"" was used to calculate gene expression signature, including the 
Buffa hypoxia (BH) score, a validated hypoxia signature using 52 
hypoxia-regulated genes. Microbe relative abundances were modeled with primary 
tumor location and a high vs. low tertile BH score applying a gamma-distributed 
generalized linear regression using the ""stats"" package in R, with adjusted 
p-value &lt; 0.05 considered significant.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, oral cavity tumors were found to be more hypoxic 
compared to other head and neck subsites, which could potentially contribute to 
their radiation resistance. For each subsite, distinct microbial populations 
were over-represented in hypoxic tumors in a subsite-specific manner. Further 
studies focusing on an association between microbiome, hypoxia, and patient 
outcomes are warranted."
1823,"Obesity, which is considered a pandemic due to its high prevalence, is a risk 
factor for many types of cancers, including lymphoma, through a variety of 
mechanisms by promoting an inflammatory state. Specifically, over the last few 
decades, obesity has been suggested not only to increase the risk of lymphoma 
but also to be associated with poor clinical outcomes and worse responses to 
different treatments for those diseases. Within the extensive range of 
proinflammatory mediators that adipose tissue releases, leptin has been 
demonstrated to be a key adipokine due to its pleotropic effects in many 
physiological systems and diseases. In this sense, different studies have 
analyzed leptin levels and leptin/leptin receptor expressions as a probable 
bridge between obesity and lymphomas. Since both obesity and lymphomas are 
prevalent pathophysiological conditions worldwide and their incidences have 
increased over the last few years, here we review the possible role of leptin as 
a promising proinflammatory mediator promoting lymphomas."
1824,"In this study, we investigated the effects of eleven synthetic guanidines 
containing the 1,3-diphenylpropenone core on the viabilities of six human cancer 
cells. The most cytotoxic compound against human cancer cells of this series 
contains a N-tosyl group and a N-methylpiperazine moiety 6f. It was cytotoxic 
against leukemia cells (U-937, HL-60, MOLT-3, and NALM-6) with significant 
effects against Bcl-2-overexpressing U-937/Bcl-2 cells as well as the human 
melanoma SK-MEL-1 cell line. It exhibited low cytotoxicity against quiescent or 
proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The IC50 value for the 
leukemia U-937 cells was 1.6 ± 0.6 µM, a similar value to that in the 
antineoplastic agent etoposide. The guanidine containing a N-phenyl substituent 
6i was also as cytotoxic as the guanidine containing the N-tosyl substituent and 
the N-methylpiperazine group 6f against human U-937 leukemia cells and both 
synthetic guanidines were potent apoptotic inducers. Cell death was mediated by 
the activation of the initiator caspase-9 and the executioner caspase-3, and 
associated with the release of cytochrome c. These synthetic guanidines are 
potent cytotoxic compounds against several human leukemia cells and even the 
human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-1 and might be useful in the development of new 
strategies in the fight against cancer."
1825,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with distinct clinical and molecular 
characteristics. Scientific advances in molecular subtype differentiation 
support the understanding of cellular signaling, crosstalk, proliferation, 
survival, migration, and invasion mechanisms, allowing the development of new 
molecular drug targets. The breast cancer subtype with super expression and/or 
amplification of human growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is clinically aggressive, 
but prognosis significantly shifted with the advent of anti-HER2 targeted 
therapy. Zoledronic-acid (ZOL) combined with a neoadjuvant 
Trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy regimen (Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide 
followed by Docetaxel, Trastuzumab) increased the pCR rate in a RH-positive/ 
HER2-positive subgroup, according to the phase II Zo-NAnTax trial. To verify 
genes that could be related to this response, a microarray assay was performed 
finding 164 differentially expressed genes. Silico analysis of these genes 
showed signaling pathways related to growth factors, apoptosis, invasion, and 
metabolism, as well as differentially expressed genes related to estrogen 
response. In addition, the RAC3 gene was found to interact with the MVD gene, a 
member of the mevalonate pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that 
RH-positive/ HER2-positive patients present gene alterations before treatment, 
and these could be related to the improvement of pCR."
1826,"Senescence represents a unique cellular stress response characterized by a 
stable growth arrest, macromolecular alterations, and wide spectrum changes in 
gene expression. Classically, senescence is the end-product of progressive 
telomeric attrition resulting from the repetitive division of somatic cells. In 
addition, senescent cells accumulate in premalignant lesions, in part, as a 
product of oncogene hyperactivation, reflecting one element of the tumor 
suppressive function of senescence. Oncogenic processes that induce senescence 
include overexpression/hyperactivation of H-Ras, B-Raf, and cyclin E as well as 
inactivation of PTEN. Oncogenic viruses, such as Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), 
have also been shown to induce senescence. High-risk strains of HPV drive the 
immortalization, and hence transformation, of cervical epithelial cells via 
several mechanisms, but primarily via deregulation of the cell cycle, and 
possibly, by facilitating escape from senescence. Despite the wide and 
successful utilization of HPV vaccines in reducing the incidence of cervical 
cancer, this measure is not effective in preventing cancer development in 
individuals already positive for HPV. Accordingly, in this commentary, we focus 
on the potential contribution of oncogene and HPV-induced senescence (OIS) in 
cervical cancer. We further consider the potential utility of senolytic agents 
for the elimination of HPV-harboring senescent cells as a strategy for reducing 
HPV-driven transformation and the risk of cervical cancer development."
1827,"This study investigated whether sphingosine is effective as prophylaxis against 
Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. In vitro experiments showed that sphingosine 
is very efficacious against A. fumigatus and Nakeomyces glabrataa (formerly 
named C. glabrata). A mouse model of invasive aspergillosis showed that 
sphingosine exerts a prophylactic effect and that sphingosine-treated animals 
exhibit a strong survival advantage after infection. Furthermore, mechanistic 
studies showed that treatment with sphingosine leads to the early depolarization 
of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and the generation of 
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and to a release of cytochrome C within 
minutes, thereby presumably initiating apoptosis. Because of its very good 
tolerability and ease of application, inhaled sphingosine should be further 
developed as a possible prophylactic agent against pulmonary aspergillosis among 
severely immunocompromised patients."
1828,"This study confirmed the effect of sodium/iodine symporter (NIS) expression on 
existing drugs by in vitro and in vivo tests using cultured cell lines. The 
tumor growth inhibitory effect of sodium astatide ([211At]NaAt) was evaluated by 
in vitro and in vivo tests using human thyroid cancer cells (K1, K1/NIS and 
K1/NIS-DOX). NIS expression in cancer cells was controlled using the Tet-On 
system. [131I]NaI was used as control existing drug. From the results of the in 
vitro studies, the mechanism of [211At]NaAt uptake into thyroid cancer cells is 
mediated by NIS, analogous to [131I]NaI, and the cellular uptake rate correlates 
with the expression level of NIS. [211At]NaAt's ability to inhibit colony 
formation was more than 10 times that of [131I]NaI per becquerel (Bq), and 
[211At]NaAt's DNA double-strand breaking (DSB) induction was more than ten times 
that of [131I]NaI per Bq, and [211At]NaAt was more than three times more 
cytotoxic than [131I]NaI (at 1000 kBq each). In vivo studies also showed that 
the tumor growth inhibitory effect of [211At]NaAt depended on NIS expression and 
was more than six times that of [131I]NaI per Bq."
1829,"Previous in vitro studies have shown that the intestinal luminal content, 
including metabolites, possibly regulates epithelial layer responses to harmful 
stimuli and promotes disease. Therefore, we aimed to test the hypothesis that 
fecal supernatants from patients with colon cancer (CC), ulcerative colitis (UC) 
and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) contain distinct metabolite profiles and 
establish their effects on Caco-2 cells and human-derived colon organoids 
(colonoids). The metabolite profiles of fecal supernatants were analyzed by 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and distinguished patients with CC (n = 
6), UC (n = 6), IBS (n = 6) and healthy subjects (n = 6). Caco-2 monolayers and 
human apical-out colonoids underwent stimulation with fecal supernatants from 
different patient groups and healthy subjects. Their addition did not impair 
monolayer integrity, as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance; 
however, fecal supernatants from different patient groups and healthy subjects 
altered the gene expression of Caco-2 monolayers, as well as colonoid cultures. 
In conclusion, the stimulation of Caco-2 cells and colonoids with fecal 
supernatants derived from CC, UC and IBS patients altered gene expression 
profiles, potentially reflecting the luminal microenvironment of the fecal 
sample donor. This experimental approach allows for investigating the crosstalk 
at the gut barrier and the effects of the gut microenvironment in the 
pathogenesis of intestinal diseases."
1830,"The vital tissue homeostasis regulator p53 forms a tetramer when it binds to DNA 
and regulates the genes that mediate essential biological processes such as 
cell-cycle arrest, senescence, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Missense mutations in 
the core DNA-binding domain (109-292) simultaneously cause the loss of p53 tumor 
suppressor function and accumulation of the mutant p53 proteins that are 
carcinogenic. The most common p53 hotspot mutation at codon 248 in the 
DNA-binding region, where arginine (R) is substituted by tryptophan (W), glycine 
(G), leucine (L), proline (P), and glutamine (Q), is reported in various 
cancers. However, it is unclear how the p53 Arg248 mutation with distinct amino 
acid substitution affects the structure, function, and DNA binding affinity. 
Here, we characterized the pathogenicity and protein stability of p53 hotspot 
mutations at codon 248 using computational tools PredictSNP, Align GVGD, HOPE, 
ConSurf, and iStable. We found R248W, R248G, and R248P mutations highly 
deleterious and destabilizing. Further, we subjected all five R248 
mutant-p53-DNA and wt-p53-DNA complexes to molecular dynamics simulation to 
investigate the structural stability and DNA binding affinity. From the MD 
simulation analysis, we observed increased RMSD, RMSF, and Rg values and 
decreased protein-DNA intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the R248-p53-DNA than the 
wt-p53-DNA complexes. Likewise, due to high SASA values, we observed the 
shrinkage of proteins in R248W, R248G, and R248P mutant-p53-DNA complexes. 
Compared to other mutant p53-DNA complexes, the R248W, R248G, and R248P 
mutant-p53-DNA complexes showed more structural alteration. MM-PBSA analysis 
showed decreased binding energies with DNA in all five R248-p53-DNA mutants than 
the wt-p53-DNA complexes. Henceforth, we conclude that the amino acid 
substitution of Arginine with the other five amino acids at codon 248 reduces 
the p53 protein's affinity for DNA and may disrupt cell division, resulting in a 
gain of p53 function. The proposed study influences the development of 
rationally designed molecular-targeted treatments that improve p53-based 
therapeutic outcomes in cancer."
1831,"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and ranks first in 
terms of both prevalence and cancer-related mortality in women. In this study, 
we aimed to evaluate the anticancer effect of mebendazole (MBZ) and radiotherapy 
(RT) concomitant use in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and elucidate 
the underlying mechanisms of action. Breast cancer mouse models and several 
types of breast cancer cells, including TNBC-derived RT-resistant (RT-R) 
MDA-MB-231 cells, were treated with MBZ and/or RT. In mice, changes in body 
weight, renal and liver toxicity, tumor volume, and number of lung metastases 
were determined. In cells, cell viability, colony formation, scratch wound 
healing, Matrigel invasion, and protein expression using western blotting were 
determined. Our findings showed that MBZ and RT combined treatment increased the 
anticancer effect of RT without additional toxicity. In addition, we noted that 
cyclin B1, PH2AX, and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity increased 
following MBZ + RT treatment compared to unaided RT. Our results suggest that 
MBZ + RT have an enhanced anticancer effect in TNBC which acquires radiation 
resistance through blocking cell cycle progression, initiating DNA double-strand 
breaks, and promoting NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity."
1832,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls brain homeostasis; it is formed by 
vascular endothelial cells that are physically connected by tight junctions 
(TJs). The BBB expresses efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and 
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which limit the passage of substrate 
molecules from blood circulation to the brain. Focused ultrasound (FUS) with 
microbubbles can create a local and reversible detachment of the TJs. However, 
very little is known about the effect of FUS on the expression of efflux 
transporters. We investigated the in vivo effects of moderate acoustic pressures 
on both P-gp and BCRP expression for up to two weeks after sonication. Magnetic 
resonance-guided FUS was applied in the striatum of 12 rats. P-gp and BCRP 
expression were determined by immunohistochemistry at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days 
postFUS. Our results indicate that FUS-induced BBB opening is capable of (i) 
decreasing P-gp expression up to 3 days after sonication in both the treated and 
in the contralateral brain regions and is capable of (ii) overexpressing BCRP up 
to 7 days after FUS in the sonicated regions only. Our findings may help improve 
FUS-aided drug delivery strategies by considering both the mechanical effect on 
the TJs and the regulation of P-gp and BCRP."
1833,"Since chronic inflammation can be seen in severe, long-lasting diseases such as 
cancer, there is a high demand for effective methods to modulate inflammatory 
responses. Among many therapeutic candidates, lignans, absorbed from various 
plant sources, represent a type of phytoestrogen classified into 
secoisolariciresionol (Seco), pinoresinol (Pino), matairesinol (Mat), 
medioresinol (Med), sesamin (Ses), syringaresinol (Syr), and lariciresinol 
(Lari). Lignans consumed by humans can be further modified into END or ENL by 
the activities of gut microbiota. Lignans are known to exert antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory activities, together with activity in estrogen 
receptor-dependent pathways. Lignans may have therapeutic potential for 
postmenopausal symptoms, including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and 
psychological disorders. Moreover, the antitumor efficacy of lignans has been 
demonstrated in various cancer cell lines, including hormone-dependent breast 
cancer and prostate cancer, as well as colorectal cancer. Interestingly, the 
molecular mechanisms of lignans in these diseases involve the inhibition of 
inflammatory signals, including the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway. Therefore, 
we summarize the recent in vitro and in vivo studies evaluating the biological 
effects of various lignans, focusing on their values as effective 
anti-inflammatory agents."
1834,"PyK2 is a member of the proline-rich tyrosine kinase and focal adhesion kinase 
families and is ubiquitously expressed. PyK2 is mainly activated by stimuli, 
such as activated Src kinases and intracellular acidic pH. The mechanism of PyK2 
activation in cancer cells has been addressed extensively. The up-regulation of 
PyK2 through overexpression and enhanced phosphorylation is a key feature of 
tumorigenesis and cancer migration. In this review, we summarized the cancer 
milieu, including acidification and cancer-associated molecules, such as 
chemical reagents, interactive proteins, chemokine-related molecules, calcium 
channels/transporters, and oxidative molecules that affect the fate of PyK2. The 
inhibition of PyK2 leads to a beneficial strategy to attenuate cancer cell 
development, including metastasis. Thus, we highlighted the effect of PyK2 on 
various cancer cell types and the distribution of molecules that affect PyK2 
activation. In particular, we underlined the relationship between PyK2 and 
cancer metastasis and its potential to treat cancer cells."
1835,"A moderate amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is produced under normal 
conditions, where they play an important role in cell signaling and are involved 
in many aspects of the immune response to pathogens. On the other hand, the 
excessive production of ROS destructs macromolecules, cell membranes, and DNA, 
and activates pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, which may lead to various 
pathologic conditions. Gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa is constantly exposed to ROS 
due to the presence of bacteria and other infectious pathogens in food, as well 
as alcohol consumption, smoking, and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAID). Prolonged excessive oxidative stress and inflammation are two 
major risk factors for GI disorders such as ulcers and cancers. Bioactive food 
compounds with potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity have been 
tested in experimental GI disease models to evaluate their therapeutic 
potential. Astaxanthin (AST) is a fat-soluble xanthophyll carotenoid that is 
naturally present in algae, yeast, salmon, shrimp, and krill. It has been shown 
that AST exhibits protective effects against GI diseases via multiple 
mechanisms. Residing at the surface and inside of cell membranes, AST directly 
neutralizes ROS and lipid peroxyl radicals, enhances the activity of 
anti-oxidant enzymes, and suppresses pro-inflammatory transcription factors and 
cytokines. In addition, AST has been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth and 
metastasis via modulating cell proliferation-related pathways, apoptosis, and 
autophagy. Considering the potential benefits of AST in GI diseases, this review 
paper aims to summarize recent advances in AST research, focusing on its 
anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects against gastric and intestinal ulcers 
and cancers."
1836,"RhoA, a member of Rho GTPases, regulates myriad cellular processes. Abnormal 
expression of RhoA has been implicated in various diseases, including cancers, 
developmental disorders and bacterial infections. RhoA mutations G14V and Q63L 
have been reported to constitutively activate RhoA. To figure out the 
mechanisms, in total, 1.8 μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed 
here on RhoAWT and mutants G14V and Q63L in GTP-bound forms, followed by dynamic 
analysis. Both mutations were found to affect the conformational dynamics of 
RhoA switch regions, especially switch I, shifting the whole ensemble from the 
wild type's open inactive state to different active-like states, where T37 and 
Mg2+ played important roles. In RhoAG14V, both switches underwent thorough state 
transition, whereas in RhoAQ63L, only switch I was sustained in a much more 
closed conformation with additional hydrophobic interactions introduced by L63. 
Moreover, significantly decreased solvent exposure of the GTP-binding site was 
observed in both mutants with the surrounding hydrophobic regions expanded, 
which furnished access to water molecules required for hydrolysis more difficult 
and thereby impaired GTP hydrolysis. These structural and dynamic differences 
first suggested the potential activation mechanism of RhoAG14V and RhoAQ63L. 
Together, our findings complemented the understanding of RhoA activation at the 
atomic level and can be utilized in the development of novel therapies for 
RhoA-related diseases."
1837,"Chronic infection with hepatitis C (HCV) is a major risk factor in the 
development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Lipid metabolism plays a 
major role in the replication and deposition of HCV at lipid droplets (LDs). We 
have demonstrated the importance of LD-associated proteins of the perilipin 
family in steatotic liver diseases. Using a large collection of 231 human liver 
biopsies with HCV, perilipins 1 and 2 have been localized to LDs of hepatocytes 
that correlate with the degree of steatosis and specific HCV genotypes, but not 
significantly with the HCV viral load. Perilipin 1- and 2-positive 
microvesicular steatotic foci were observed in 36% of HCV liver biopsies, and 
also in chronic hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis and mildly steatotic or normal 
livers, but less or none were observed in normal livers of younger patients. 
Microvesicular steatotic foci did not frequently overlap with glycogenotic/clear 
cell foci as determined by PAS stain in serial sections. Steatotic foci were 
detected in all liver zones with slight architectural disarrays, as demonstrated 
by immunohistochemical glutamine synthetase staining of zone three, but without 
elevated Ki67-proliferation rates. In conclusion, microvesicular steatotic foci 
are frequently found in chronic viral hepatitis, but the clinical significance 
of these foci is so far not clear."
1838,"The mammalian 14-3-3 family comprises seven intrinsically unstructured, 
evolutionarily conserved proteins that bind &gt;200 protein targets, thereby 
modulating cell-signaling pathways. The presence of 14-3-3 proteins in 
cerebrospinal fluid provides a sensitive and specific biomarker of neuronal 
damage associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
(CJD), spongiform encephalitis, brain cancers, and stroke. We observed 
significant enrichment of 14-3-3 paralogs G, S, and Z in human brain aggregates 
diagnostic of AD. We used intra-aggregate crosslinking to identify 14-3-3 
interaction partners, all of which were significantly enriched in AD brain 
aggregates relative to controls. We screened FDA-approved drugs in silico for 
structures that could target the 14-3-3G/hexokinase interface, an interaction 
specific to aggregates and AD. C. elegans possesses only two 14-3-3 orthologs, 
which bind diverse proteins including DAF-16 (a FOXO transcription factor) and 
SIR-2.1 (a sensor of nutrients and stress), influencing lifespan. Top drug 
candidates were tested in C. elegans models of neurodegeneration-associated 
aggregation and in a human neuroblastoma cell-culture model of AD-like 
amyloidosis. Several drugs opposed aggregation in all models assessed and 
rescued behavioral deficits in C. elegans AD-like neuropathy models, suggesting 
that 14-3-3 proteins are instrumental in aggregate accrual and supporting the 
advancement of drugs targeting 14-3-3 protein complexes with their partners."
1839,"Breast cancer accounts for almost one quarter of all female cancers worldwide, 
and more than 90% of those who are diagnosed with breast cancer undergo 
mastectomy or breast conservation surgery. Local anesthetics effectively inhibit 
the invasion of cancer cells at concentrations that are used in surgical 
procedures. The limited treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC) demonstrate unmet clinical needs. In this study, four local anesthetics, 
lidocaine, levobupivacaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine, were applied to two 
breast tumor cell types, TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells and triple-positive breast cancer 
BT-474 cells. In addition to the induction of apoptosis and the suppression of 
the cellular proliferation rate, the four local anesthetics decreased the levels 
of reactive oxygen species and increased the autophagy elongation indicator in 
both cell types. Our combination index analysis with doxorubicin showed that 
ropivacaine had a synergistic effect on the two cell types, and lidocaine had a 
synergistic effect only in MDA-MB-231 cells; the others had no synergistic 
effects on doxorubicin. Lidocaine contributed significantly to the formation of 
autophagolysosomes in a dose-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 cells but not in 
BT-474 cells. Our study demonstrated that the four local anesthetics can reduce 
tumor growth and proliferation and promote apoptosis and autophagy."
1840,"Helicobacter pylori infection triggers inflammation that may lead to gastritis, 
stomach ulcers and cancer. Probiotic bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, have been 
of interest as treatment options, however, little is known about the molecular 
mechanisms of Lactobacillus-mediated inhibition of H. pylori pathogenesis. In 
this work, we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus culture supernatants, 
so-called conditioned medium (CM), from two gastric isolates, L. gasseri and L. 
oris, on the expression of transcriptional regulators in H. pylori. Among the 
four known two-component systems (TCSs), i.e., ArsRS, FlgRS, CheAY and CrdRS, 
the flagellar regulator gene flgR and the acid resistance associated arsS gene 
were down-regulated by L. gasseri CM, whereas expression of the other TCS-genes 
remained unaffected. L. gasseri CM also reduced the motility of H. pylori, which 
is in line with reduced flgR expression. Furthermore, among six transcription 
factors of H. pylori only the ferric uptake regulator gene fur was regulated by 
L. gasseri CM. Deletion of fur further led to dramatically increased sensitivity 
to the antimicrobial peptide LL-37. Taken together, the results highlight that 
released/secreted factors of some lactobacilli, but not all, downregulate 
transcriptional regulators involved in motility, acid tolerance and LL-37 
sensitivity of H. pylori."
1841,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a monoclonal gammopathy characterized by biological 
heterogeneity and unregulated proliferation of plasma cells (PCs) in bone marrow 
(BM). MM is a multistep process based on genomic instability, epigenetic 
dysregulation and a tight cross-talk with the BM microenvironment that plays a 
pivotal role supporting the proliferation, survival, drug-resistance and homing 
of PCs. The BM microenvironment consists of a hematopoietic and a 
non-hematopoietic compartment, which cooperate to create a tumor environment. 
Among the non-hematopoietic component, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and 
osteoblasts (OBs) appear transcriptionally and functionally different in MM 
patients compared to healthy donors (HDs) and to patients with pre-malignant 
monoclonal gammopathies. Alterations of both MSCs and OBs underly the osteolytic 
lesions that characterize myeloma-associated bone disease. In this review, we 
will discuss the different characteristics of MSCs and OBs in MM patients, 
analyzing the transcriptome, the deregulated molecular pathways and the role 
performed by miRNAs and exosome in the pathophysiology of MM."
1842,"Claudin-2 (CLDN2), a component of tight junctions, is abnormally expressed in 
human lung adenocarcinoma tissue. CLDN2 contributes to chemoresistance in human 
lung adenocarcinoma-derived A549 cells, and it may be a target for cancer 
therapy. Here, we found that coffee ingredients, namely caffeine and 
theobromine, decreased the protein level of CLDN2 in human lung 
adenocarcinoma-derived A549 cells. In contrast, other components, such as 
theophylline and chlorogenic acid, had no effect. These results indicate that 
the 7-methyl group in methylxanthines may play a key role in the reduction in 
CLDN2 expression. The caffeine-induced reduction in the CLDN2 protein was 
inhibited by chloroquine, a lysosome inhibitor. In a protein-stability assay 
using cycloheximide, CLDN2 protein levels decreased faster in caffeine-treated 
cells than in vehicle-treated cells. These results suggest that caffeine 
accelerates the lysosomal degradation of CLDN2. The accumulation and 
cytotoxicity of doxorubicin were dose-dependently increased, which was 
exaggerated by caffeine but not by theophylline in spheroids. Caffeine decreased 
nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) levels without affecting 
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α levels. Furthermore, caffeine decreased the 
expression of Nrf2-targeted genes. The effects of caffeine on CLDN2 expression 
and anticancer-drug-induced toxicity were also observed in lung adenocarcinoma 
RERF-LC-MS cells. We suggest that caffeine enhances doxorubicin-induced toxicity 
in A549 spheroids mediated by the reduction in CLDN2 and Nrf2 expression."

of DNA, and point mutations, are major elements of cancer development [...]."
1844,"The detrimental impact of smoking on health and wellbeing are irrefutable. 
Additionally, smoking is associated with the development of cancer, a reduction 
treatment outcomes and poorer health outcomes. Nevertheless, a significant 
number of people continue to smoke following a cancer diagnosis. Little is 
understood of the smoking cessation services provided to smokers with cancer or 
their engagement with them. This systematic review aimed to identify existing 
smoking cessation interventions for this cohort diagnosed with breast, head and 
neck, lung and cervical cancers (linked to risk). Systematic searches of Pubmed, 
Embase, Psych Info and CINAHL from 1 January 2015 to 15 December 2020 were 
conducted. Included studies examined the characteristics of smoking cessation 
interventions and impact on referrals and quit attempts. The impact on 
healthcare professionals was included if reported. Included studies were 
restricted to adults with a cancer diagnosis and published in English. No 
restriction was placed on study designs, and narrative data synthesis was 
conducted due to heterogeneity. A review protocol was registered on PROSPERO CRD 
42020214204, and reporting adheres to PRISMA reporting guidelines. Data were 
screened, extracted in duplicate and an assessment of the quality of evidence 
undertaken using Mixed Methods Assessment Tool. 23 studies met the inclusion 
criteria, representing USA, Canada, England, Lebanon, Australia and including 
randomized controlled trials (9), observational studies (10), quality 
improvement (3), and one qualitative study. Hospital and cancer clinics 
[including a dental clinic] were the settings for all studies. 43% (10/23) of 
studies reported interventions for smokers diagnosed with head and neck cancer, 
13% (3/23) for smokers diagnosed with lung cancer, one study provides evidence 
for breast cancer, and the remaining nine studies (39%) report on multiple 
cancers including the ones specified in this review. Methodological quality was 
variable. There were limited data to identify one optimal intervention for this 
cohort. Key elements included the timing and frequency of quit conversations, 
use of electronic records, pharmacotherapy including extended use of 
varenicline, increased counselling sessions and a service embedded in oncology 
departments. More studies are required to ensure tailored smoking cessation 
pathways are co-developed for smokers with a diagnosis of cancer to support this 
population."
1845,"Funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Research Centers in 
Minority Institutions (RCMI) Program fosters the development and implementation 
of innovative research aimed at improving minority health and reducing or 
eliminating health disparities. Currently, there are 21 RCMI Specialized (U54) 
Centers that share the same framework, comprising four required core components, 
namely the Administrative, Research Infrastructure, Investigator Development, 
and Community Engagement Cores. The Research Infrastructure Core (RIC) is 
fundamentally important for biomedical and health disparities research as a 
critical function domain. This paper aims to assess the research resources and 
services provided and evaluate the best practices in research resources 
management and networking across the RCMI Consortium. We conducted a 
REDCap-based survey and collected responses from 57 RIC Directors and 
Co-Directors from 98 core leaders. Our findings indicated that the RIC 
facilities across the 21 RCMI Centers provide access to major research equipment 
and are managed by experienced faculty and staff who provide expert consultative 
and technical services. However, several impediments to RIC facilities operation 
and management have been identified, and these are currently being addressed 
through implementation of cost-effective strategies and best practices of 
laboratory management and operation."
1846,"BACKGROUND: The referral process is an important research focus because of the 
potential consequences of delays, especially for patients with serious medical 
conditions that need immediate care, such as those with metastatic cancer. Thus, 
a systematic literature review of recent and influential manuscripts is critical 
to understanding the current methods and future directions in order to improve 
the referral process.
METHODS: A hybrid bibliometric-structured review was conducted using both 
quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Searches were conducted of three 
databases, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed, in addition to the references 
from the eligible papers. The papers were considered to be eligible if they were 
relevant English articles or reviews that were published from January 2010 to 
June 2021. The searches were conducted using three groups of keywords, and 
bibliometric analysis was performed, followed by content analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 163 papers that were published in impactful journals between 
January 2010 and June 2021 were selected. These papers were then reviewed, 
analyzed, and categorized as follows: descriptive analysis (n = 77), cause and 
effect (n = 12), interventions (n = 50), and quality management (n = 24). Six 
future research directions were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimal attention was given to the study of the primary referral of 
blood cancer cases versus those with solid cancer types, which is a gap that 
future studies should address. More research is needed in order to optimize the 
referral process, specifically for suspected hematological cancer patients."
1847,"BACKGROUND: National and international guidance recommends whole-school 
approaches to physical activity, but there are few studies assessing their 
effectiveness, especially at an organisational level. This study assesses the 
impact of the Creating Active School's (CAS) programme on organisational changes 
to physical activity provision.
METHODS: In-school CAS leads completed a 77-item questionnaire assessing 
school-level organisational change. The questionnaire comprised 19 domains 
aligned with the CAS framework and COM-B model of behaviour change. Wilcoxon 
Signed Rank Tests assessed the pre-to-nine-month change.
RESULTS: &gt;70% of schools (n = 53) pre-CAS had inadequate whole-school 
physical activity provision. After nine months (n = 32), CAS had a significant 
positive effect on organisational physical activity. The positive change was 
observed for: whole-school culture and ethos, teachers and wider school staff, 
academic lessons, physical education (PE) lessons, commute to/from school and 
stakeholder behaviour.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that CAS is a viable model 
to facilitate system-level change for physical activity in schools located 
within deprived areas of a multi-ethnic city. To confirm the results, future 
studies are required which adopt controlled designs combined with a holistic 
understanding of implementation determinants and underlying mechanisms."
1848,"To provide the latest evidence for future research and practice, this study 
critically reviewed Indigenous peoples' cancer care experiences in the 
Australian healthcare system from the patient's point of view. After searching 
PubMed, CINAHL and Scopus databases, twenty-three qualitative studies were 
included in this review. The inductive approach was used for analysing 
qualitative data on cancer care experience in primary, tertiary and transitional 
care between systems. Three main themes were found in healthcare services from 
Indigenous cancer care experiences: communication, cultural safety, and access 
to services. Communication was an important theme for all healthcare systems, 
including language and literacy, understanding of cancer care pathways and 
hospital environment, and lack of information. Cultural safety was related to 
trust in the system, privacy, and racism. Access to health services was the main 
concern in transitional care between healthcare systems. While some challenges 
will need long-term and collective efforts, such as institutional racism as a 
downstream effect of colonisation, cultural training for healthcare providers 
and increasing the volume of the Indigenous workforce, such as Indigenous 
Liaison Officers or Indigenous Care Coordinators, could effectively address this 
inequity issue for Indigenous people with cancer in Australia in a timely 
manner."
1849,"Despite the growing concern raised by organic pollutants from the petrochemical 
industry to the surrounding soils, the heavy metal (HM) pollution in these soils 
remains understudied. This study investigated the levels, potential sources, and 
human-health risks of 12 HMs in soils inside and in surrounding areas of a 
petrochemical complex. Generally, the levels of 12 HMs in all soil samples were 
lower than the national standard of China, except for the Cd in one surrounding 
soil sample. Approximately 40.9% and 98.1% of soils around and inside the 
petrochemical complex, respectively, were at slightly contaminated levels. The 
HM pollution in 94.4% of soils inside and 32% of soils in surrounding areas were 
mainly affected by petrochemical production. Human-health risk showed that 
although As posed an acceptable cancer risk for adults both in and around the 
complex, high cancer risk for surrounding children from As was observed. 
Moreover, around the complex, Cr, Cd, and Pb posed acceptable cancer risks for 
children, while Cd posed an acceptable cancer risk for adults. The spatial 
distribution of the health risks decreased with increasing distance from the 
complex. Overall, our results demonstrate that it is essential to minimize human 
exposure to HMs originating from the petrochemical industry, especially As, Cr, 
Cd, and Pb."
1850,"BACKGROUND: A number of studies have reported breasts have high fluctuating 
asymmetry (FA:|Right-Left|), suggesting that they contain evolutionary and 
clinical information (e.g., high FA correlates with breast cancer risk). Here we 
focus on breast FA in women with a wide range of breast sizes, including 
participants with macromastia and/or gigantomastia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample included 65 women (mean age 33.97 ± 12.1 
years). Thirty were randomly selected students and/or patients who regarded 
their breast size as small, normal or average and who had not undergone or 
intended to have any breast surgery. The remainder (n = 35) were qualified for 
breast reduction due to macromastia and/or gigantomastia. In all participants we 
measured/calculated weight, height and BMI, as well as took chest photographs. 
Breast volumes and nipple areola complex FAs were evaluated in a 
specifically-designed software.
RESULTS: Breast size significantly positively correlated with breast volume FA 
in all women (t = 5.17, p &lt; 0.0001) and in women with 
macromastia/gigantomastia (t = 2.32, p = 0.027). All nipple location FAs 
correlated positively with breast size.
CONCLUSIONS: In women with different breast sizes, breast size correlates with 
FA calculated from breast volume and nipple location FAs. In women with 
macromastia and/or gigantomastia, breasts present higher FA than ""normal"" 
breasts. This observation may give a rationale for earlier and more frequent 
prophylactic breast imaging in women with macromastia and/or gigantomastia."
1851,"INTRODUCTION: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder that substantially 
affects women's health. It is particularly diagnosed in young patients. Women 
with PCOS are burdened with excessive weight gain, overweight and obesity (74%) 
compared to a healthy female population. Excessive weight influences 
psychological state and emotional well-being, whereas in the meantime, 
psychological and behavioral dysfunction is increasingly being diagnosed among 
patients with PCOS.
AIM: To assess depressive symptoms and emotional control among women with PCOS 
in relation to BMI.
METHODS: The study was conducted among 671 self-reported PCOS women. The 
standardized Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to assess depressive 
disorders. Emotion control was assessed using the Courtauld Emotional Control 
Scale (CECS).
RESULTS: Moderate and severe depressive symptoms were more common in PCOS women 
with abnormal BMI compared to normal BMI subjects (p &lt; 0.01). In total, 27.1% 
of obese women had moderate depression and 28.8% had severe depression. Among 
overweight women, 19.9% suffered from moderate and 25% from severe depressive 
symptoms. Underweight women also reported moderate (25.6%) and severe (33.3%) 
depressive signs. There were no statistically significant differences between 
the body weight of the women studied and the CECS scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms are more common in women with PCOS and abnormal 
BMI than in women with PCOS and proper BMI. The severity of depressive symptoms 
increases with BMI, but underweight women with PCOS are also at risk of 
depressive disorders. The level of suppression of negative emotions is 
independent of BMI in women with PCOS."
1852,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable disruption to cancer care and may 
have exacerbated existing challenges already faced by cancer survivors from 
rural areas. This has created a need for a rapid evidence synthesis to inform 
the development of tailored interventions that address the specific needs of 
rural cancer survivors who continue to be affected by the pandemic. The review 
was conducted following guidance from the Cochrane Rapid Review Methods Group. 
Database searches were performed via the EBSCOHost interface (includes MEDLINE, 
CINAHL, PsycINFO) on 25 May 2022 and supplemented with searches on Google 
Scholar. Peer-reviewed articles published after March 2020 that reported primary 
data on the experiences of cancer survivors residing in rural and remote 
settings during the pandemic were included. Findings were tabulated and written 
up narratively. Fourteen studies were included. The COVID-19 pandemic had a 
mostly detrimental impact on the experiences of rural cancer survivors. People's 
individual coping mechanisms were challenging for a range of reasons. 
Specifically, the pandemic impacted on their ability to access testing, 
treatment, check-ups and supportive care, their ability to maintain and access 
social support with close friends and family, as well as negative consequences 
to their finances and emotional wellbeing with some reporting feelings of 
psychological distress including depression and anxiety. This review provides 
important insight into the experiences of rural cancer survivors that may help 
inform tailored support in line with the needs and challenges faced because of 
the pandemic."
1853,"We performed a meta-analysis of chemo-brain diagnostic, pooling sensitivities, 
and specificities in order to assess the accuracy of a machine-learning (ML) 
algorithm in breast cancer survivors previously treated with chemotherapy. We 
searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for eligible articles before 30 
September 2022. We identified three eligible studies from which we extracted 
seven ML algorithms. For our data, the χ2 tests demonstrated the homogeneity of 
the sensitivity's models (χ2 = 7.6987, df = 6, p-value = 0.261) and the 
specificities of the ML models (χ2 = 3.0151, df = 6, p-value = 0.807). The 
pooled area under the curve (AUC) for the overall ML models in this study was 
0.914 (95%CI: 0.891-0.939) and partial AUC (restricted to observed false 
positive rates and normalized) was 0.844 (95%CI: 0.80-0.889). Additionally, the 
pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity values were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75-0.86) 
and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.76-0.86), respectively. From all included ML models, support 
vector machine demonstrated the best test performance. ML models represent a 
promising, reliable modality for chemo-brain prediction in breast cancer 
survivors previously treated with chemotherapy, demonstrating high accuracy."
1854,"Early melanoma diagnosis plays a key role in ensuring best prognosis with good 
survival rates. The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted global 
and national healthcare systems, thus making it a real challenge. The aim of 
this study was to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on diagnostic delay in 
melanoma patients in Serbia. In this retrospective study, we included patients 
treated at the university hospital in Serbia's capitol over a period of five 
years and three months. We compared the prepandemic (01/JAN/17-14/MAR/20) and 
pandemic periods (15/MAR/20-31/MAR/22) by evaluating patient demographic data, 
melanoma subtype, Breslow thickness, Clark level, ulceration status, mitotic 
index rate and pT staging. We observed a significant reduction in the number of 
diagnosed patients (86.3 vs. 13.7%; p = 0.036), with melanomas having an 
increased median Breslow thickness (1.80 vs. 3.00; p = 0.010), a higher 
percentage of Clark IV-V level lesions (44.0% vs. 63.0%; p = 0.009), an increase 
in median mitotic index rate (2 vs. 5; p &lt; 0.001) and a trend of increase in 
lesions thicker than 2 mm (37.8% vs. 53.7%; p = 0.026). We believe that this 
study can be a useful scenario guide for future similar events, highlighting the 
importance of preventive measures and timely diagnosis for the best patient 
outcomes."
1855,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic stressed the necessity of a new resilience 
of the human population and health system. The ""WeCare Generation"" program is a 
new proposal of territorial intervention, with a new paradigm, on the diseases 
of the human body and mind.
BACKGROUND: In recent decades, the independent strands of investigation on brain 
plasticity and early trauma consequences have demonstrated that traumatic 
experiences in the period from pregnancy to the age of 3 years have an enormous 
impact on an individual's future development, and both physical and mental 
health. Research shows that adverse child experiences (ACEs) are associated with 
a strong risk of conditions such as: harmful alcohol use, smoking, illicit drug 
use, high body-mass index, depression, anxiety, interpersonal violence, cancer, 
type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, stroke respiratory diseases and, as a 
consequence, to a high financial cost in Italy and also across Europe (1-9% GDP) 
and the USA (total annual costs estimated to be USD 581 billion in Europe and 
USD 748 billion in North America). All this suggests that an early intervention 
on that traumatized-slice of population leads to multiplied savings.
METHODS: A multi-center, randomized, controlled trial was designed. The parents 
of the future neonatal population (from pregnancy to delivery) with trauma will 
be enrolled, and randomized to treatment, or control arm. The article describes 
in detail how the primary outpoint (cost to the national health system), and 
some secondary outpoints, will be collected.
DISCUSSION: An overall rate of return on investment (ROI) statistically 
significant 13.0% per annum with an associated benefit/cost ratio (BCR) of 6.3 
is expected as the primary outcome of the ""WeCare Generation"" program. Our 
proposed model predicts a new medical paradigm aiming to empower new 
generations, with a strong return on economy and health."
1856,"Head and neck cancers (HNC) are often late stage at diagnosis; stage is a major 
determinant of prognosis. The urgent cancer referral pathway (two week wait; 
2WW) within England's National Health Service aims to reduce time to diagnosis. 
We investigated factors associated with HNC route to diagnosis. Data were 
obtained from the English population-based cancer registry on 66,411 primary 
invasive HNCs (ICD C01-14 and C31-32) diagnosed 2006-2014. Multivariable 
logistic regression determined the likelihood of different diagnosis routes by 
patients' demographic and clinical characteristics. Significant 
socio-demographic inequalities were observed. Emergency presentations declined 
over time and 2WW increased. Significant socio-demographic inequalities were 
observed. Non-white patients, aged over 65, residing in urban areas with 
advanced disease, were more likely to have emergency presentations. White males 
aged 55 and older with an oropharynx cancer were more likely to be diagnosed via 
2WW. Higher levels of deprivation were associated with both emergency and 2WW 
routes. Dental referral was more likely in women, with oral cancers and lower 
stage disease. Despite the decline over time in emergency presentation and the 
increased use of 2WW, socio-demographic variation is evident in routes to 
diagnosis. Further work exploring the reasons for these inequalities, and the 
consequences for patients' care and outcomes, is urgently required."
1857,"BACKGROUND: Twelve separate streams of empirical data make a strong case for 
cannabis-induced accelerated aging including hormonal, mitochondriopathic, 
cardiovascular, hepatotoxic, immunological, genotoxic, epigenotoxic, disruption 
of chromosomal physiology, congenital anomalies, cancers including inheritable 
tumorigenesis, telomerase inhibition and elevated mortality.
METHODS: Results from a recently published longitudinal epigenomic screen were 
analyzed with regard to the results of recent large epidemiological studies of 
the causal impacts of cannabis. We also integrate theoretical syntheses with 
prior studies into these combined epigenomic and epidemiological results.
RESULTS: Cannabis dependence not only recapitulates many of the key features of 
aging, but is characterized by both age-defining and age-generating illnesses 
including immunomodulation, hepatic inflammation, many psychiatric syndromes 
with a neuroinflammatory basis, genotoxicity and epigenotoxicity. DNA breaks, 
chromosomal breakage-fusion-bridge morphologies and likely cycles, and altered 
intergenerational DNA methylation and disruption of both the histone and tubulin 
codes in the context of increased clinical congenital anomalies, cancers and 
heritable tumors imply widespread disruption of the genome and epigenome. Modern 
epigenomic clocks indicate that, in cannabis-dependent patients, cannabis 
advances cellular DNA methylation age by 25-30% at age 30 years. Data have 
implications not only for somatic but also stem cell and germ line tissues 
including post-fertilization zygotes. This effect is likely increases with the 
square of chronological age.
CONCLUSION: Recent epigenomic studies of cannabis exposure provide many 
explanations for the broad spectrum of cannabis-related teratogenicity and 
carcinogenicity and appear to account for many epidemiologically observed 
findings. Further research is indicated on the role of cannabinoids in the aging 
process both developmentally and longitudinally, from stem cell to germ cell to 
blastocystoids to embryoid bodies and beyond."
1858,"Cervical cancer is rare in adolescent and pediatric populations, with 
adenocarcinoma being the most commonly reported. Clear cell adenocarcinoma of 
the uterine cervix accounts for only 4% of all adenocarcinoma cases, and about 
two-thirds are associated with intrauterine diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure. 
We report the case of a 14-year-old virgin girl who presented with a 
1-month-long history of abnormal vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain. 
Transabdominal pelvic ultrasound examination revealed the presence of an 
irregular, homogeneous cervical mass that was 7 cm in size. Therefore, a 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan was performed to establish the origin of 
the tumor and its relationship to adjacent pelvic organs. Furthermore, a 
vaginoscopy was performed to identify the tumor, and a cervical biopsy was 
performed. Immunohistochemical and anatomopathological studies resulted in the 
diagnosis of non-HPV(Human Papilloma Virus)-related clear cell adenocarcinoma of 
the cervix. Following the oncological examination, she was admitted for 
radiotherapy. The patient had no maternal history of DES exposure in utero. Even 
though the number of cases in the literature is low, most of the virgin girls 
diagnosed with clear cell adenocarcinoma of the cervix have a fatal prognosis 
because of the delay in making a correct diagnosis."
1859,"Health risks from exposure to lithium-bearing spodumene cleavage fragments are 
unknown. While asbestiform fibres can lead to fibrosis, mesothelioma and lung 
cancer, controversy remains whether non-asbestiform cleavage fragments, having 
equivalent dimensions, elicit similar pathologic responses. The mineralogy of 
respirable particles from two alpha (α)-spodumene concentrate grades (chemical 
and technical) were characterised using semi-quantitative X-ray diffraction 
(XRD). Particles were measured using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the 
dimensions (length [L], diameter [D], aspect ratio [AR]) applied to regulatory 
counting criteria for asbestiform fibres. Application of the current World 
Health Organization (WHO) and National Occupational Health and Safety Commission 
(NOHSC) counting criteria, L ˃ 5 µm, D ˂ 3 µm, AR ˃ 3:1, to 10 SEM images of 
each grade identified 47 countable particles in the chemical and 37 in the 
technical concentrate test samples. Of these particles, 17 and 16 in the 
chemical and technical test samples, respectively, satisfied the more rigorous, 
previously used Mines Safety and Inspection Regulations 1995 (Western Australia 
[WA]) criteria, L ˃ 5 µm and D ≤ 1 µm. The majority of the countable particles 
were consistent with α-spodumene cleavage fragments. These results suggest 
elongated α-spodumene particles may pose a health risk. It is recommended the 
precautionary principle be applied to respirable α-spodumene particles and the 
identification and control of dust hazards in spodumene extraction, handling and 
processing industries be implemented."
1860,"We aimed to evaluate the impacts of disability on the diagnosis, treatment, and 
prognosis of bile duct cancer (BDC) according to the severity and type of 
disability. Patients diagnosed with BDC were selected from an age- and 
sex-matched population (1:3 ratio) with or without disabilities from the 
National Disability Database, the Korean Central Cancer Registry, and the Korean 
National Health Insurance claims database. The cohort included 15,065 patients 
with BDC, with a significantly lower rate in those with severe disabilities than 
in people without or with mild disabilities (110.6 vs. 136.5 vs. 147.6 per 105 
persons, respectively). People with severe disabilities were diagnosed with BDC 
at an earlier age but were less likely to undergo surgery (adjusted odds ratio 
(aOR) = 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.45-0.61) or chemotherapy (aOR = 
0.76, 95% CI: 0.61-0.95) compared to those without disabilities. This trend was 
more evident in patients with mental disabilities. The overall and 
cancer-specific mortality rates were higher in patients (especially women) with 
disabilities than in those without. There needs systemic approach to ensure 
equal access to quality cancer care for people with disabilities."
1861,"BACKGROUND: Cancer is very disruptive in adolescence and hospitalizations 
interfere with this development stage in becoming independent, developing social 
relationships, and making plans for the future. A major challenge in the care of 
adolescents with cancer is being able to enhance their quality of life. The aim 
of this project is to increase our understanding of how adventure therapy 
influenced quality of life for adolescents with cancer.
METHODS: Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, in collaboration with the Tender to 
Nave Italia Foundation (TTNI), has been conducting a unique project, located on 
a beautiful brigantine of the Italian Navy. Adventure therapy is a form of 
experiential therapy that consists of various types of adventure, in particular 
outdoor and sailing activities. Ninety teenagers have been the protagonists of 
this project to date and filled out two questionnaires about quality of life and 
self-esteem, before and after the sailing experience.
RESULTS: The adventure provides the opportunity for the participants to build 
interpersonal relationships and develop life skills that they can benefit from 
in the future experiences. All participants report a significant improvement in 
their quality of life and self-esteem at the end of this experience.
CONCLUSION: This collaborative adventure project is a great way to learn and 
practice new behaviors, improve interpersonal skills, heal painful emotions, 
overcome personal obstacles and challenges, and help the teenagers to resume 
their developmental path after an onco-hematological diagnosis."
1862,"The COVID-19 pandemic had a tremendous impact on healthcare systems around the 
world. This study aims to research the course of surgical treatment in urology 
during the pandemic in 2020, evaluate the volume of deferred treatment in 
urology in Poland, and indicate groups of patients that are especially 
vulnerable to a delay in the delivery of healthcare services. The National 
Health Found statistics (NHF) database was searched for information on 
procedures completed in urology departments from 2015 to 2020. Changes in 
hospital discharges of adults from 2019 to 2021 were investigated using monthly 
reports of NHF on patient billing groups. Statistics of PSA, testosterone, and 
creatinine testing were extracted from NHF reports. Annual changes in the number 
of surgeries were calculated. Then, the estimation of the expected quantity of 
procedures without the occurrence of the pandemic was performed using linear 
regression based on data from 2015 to 2020. The estimation was assumed reliable 
at R2 &gt; 0.8. The difference between collected and estimated data was 
analysed. In 2020, the volume of radical prostatectomies, cystectomies, and 
kidney surgeries noted downturns following lockdowns in March and November. All 
analysed procedures, except radical cystectomy, noted a reduction in the entire 
year. The declines reached -34% in shockwave lithotripsy, -13% in 
ureterorenoscopic lithotripsy, -22% in cystolithotripsy, -28% in percutaneous 
lithotripsy, -12% in transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT), -31% 
in transurethral resection of the prostate, -15% in nephrectomy and kidney 
tumorectomy, and -10% in radical prostatectomy. Among the analysed procedures, 
only radical cystectomy rates increased 5%. Prostate-specific antigen and 
creatinine tests fell -17%, and testosterone testing was down -18%. In 
conclusion, the patients most vulnerable to delayed treatment due to the 
post-pandemic backlog are those requiring TURBT, kidney cancer operations, and 
radical prostatectomies. Solving backlogs in urology should prioritise cancer 
patients and thus requires improved access to cystoscopy, TURBT, diagnoses and 
surgery of prostate and kidney tumours. Addressing the needs of patients 
suffering from benign diseases demands appropriate measures to increase the 
surgical productivity of urology departments."
1863,"Smoking is considered a major preventable cause of cardiovascular and lung 
diseases, as well as cancer. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was extensive 
discussion about the influence of nicotine use; ultimately, smoking was 
considered a major risk factor for poor disease progression. Therefore, in April 
2021, we conducted an anonymous cross-sectional online survey on smoking and 
vaping behavior, as well as smoking cessation, in four different countries in 
Europe (the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Italy). A total of 3605 
participants completed a questionnaire on their smoking and vaping behaviors and 
smoking cessation because of and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fear of COVID-19 
infection, a high percentage of quarantine stays (44.9% Italy and 52.1% Spain), 
and high infection (75.5% Italy and 52.4% Spain) and death (42% Italy) rates in 
respondents' personal circles were observed mostly in the surveyed populations 
of Italy and Spain. Smoking cessation attempts and success were mainly seen in 
the Italian population and were linked to psychological distress, while the same 
effects were shown for vaping in Spain. In summary, health anxiety was detected 
in all cohorts. Despite these findings, smoking as a risk factor for severe 
outcomes of COVID-19 infection did not lead to a higher rate of smoking 
cessation attempts."
1864,"Drinking water is an important natural resource. For many people worldwide, 
especially in developing countries, access to safe drinking water is still a 
dream. An increasing number of human activities and industrialization have 
caused various physical, chemical, and biological pollutants to enter water 
bodies, affecting human health. Water pollutants contain a vast number of 
additives, such as perfluorinated chemicals, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, 
phthalate, nanomaterials, insecticides, microcystins, heavy metals, and 
pharmacologies. In this work, we aim to explore the potential relationship 
between water pollutants and human diseases. Here, we explored an integrative 
approach to identify genes, biological processes, molecular functions, and 
diseases linked to exposure to these water pollutants. These processes and 
functions affected by water pollutants are related to many diseases, including 
colonic neoplasms, breast neoplasms, hepatitis B, bladder cancer, and human 
cytomegalovirus infection. In addition, further analysis revealed the genes that 
play a key role in the human diseases induced by water pollutants. Therefore, 
conducting an integrative toxicogenomic analysis of water pollutants is more 
appropriate for evaluating the potential effects of water pollutants on human 
health."
1865,"In certain populations, rice is the main source of exposure to inorganic arsenic 
(iAs), which is associated with cancer and non-cancer effects. Although rice is 
a staple food in Brazil, there have been few studies about the health risks for 
the Brazilian population. The objective of this study was to assess the risks of 
exposure to iAs from white rice and brown rice in Brazil, in terms of the 
carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects, and to propose measures to mitigate 
those risks. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) and hazard quotient 
(HQ) were calculated in a probabilistic framework. The mean ILCR was 1.5 × 10-4 
for white rice and 6.0 × 10-6 for brown rice. The HQ for white and brown rice 
was under 1. The ILCR for white and brown rice was high, even though the iAs 
concentration in rice is below the maximum contaminant level. The risk for brown 
rice consumption was lower, which was not expected. Various mitigation measures 
discussed in this report are estimated to reduce the risk from rice consumption 
by 5-67%. With the support of public policies, measures to reduce these risks 
for the Brazilian population would have a positive impact on public health."
1866,"(1) Importance: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex and only partially 
understood. Analyzing the relationship between other more treatable or 
preventable diseases and AD may help in the prevention and the eventual 
development of treatments for AD. Risk estimation in a high-risk population, 
rather than a population already affected with AD, may reduce some bias in risk 
estimates. (2) Objective: To examine the rates of various comorbidities and 
cancers in individuals at high-risk for AD, but without a clinical diagnosis, 
relative to individuals from the same population with normal AD risk. (3) 
Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a study using data from the Utah 
Population Database (UPDB). The UPDB contains linked data from the Utah Cancer 
Registry, Utah death certificates, the Intermountain Health patient population, 
and the University of Utah Health patient population. Subjects were selected 
based on the availability of ancestral data, linked health information, and 
self-reported biometrics. (4) Results: In total, 75,877 participants who were 
estimated to be at high risk for AD based on family history, but who did not 
have an active AD diagnosis, were analyzed. A lower incidence of diabetes (RR = 
0.95, 95% CI [0.92,0.97], p &lt; 0.001), hypertension (RR = 0.97, 95% CI 
[0.95,0.99], p &lt; 0.001), and heart disease (RR = 0.95, 95% CI [0.93,0.98], p 
&lt; 0.001) was found. There was no difference in rates of cerebrovascular 
disease or other forms of dementia. Of the 15 types of cancer analyzed: breast 
(RR = 1.23, 95% CI [1.16, 1.30], p &lt; 0.001); colorectal (RR = 1.30, 95% CI 
[1.21, 1.39], p &lt; 0.001); kidney (RR = 1.49, 95% CI (1.29, 1.72), p &lt; 
0.001); lung (RR = 1.25, 95% CI [1.13, 1.37], p &lt; 0.001); non-Hodgkin's 
Lymphoma (RR = 1.29, 95% CI [1.15, 1.44], p &lt; 0.001); pancreas (RR = 1.34, 
95% CI [1.16, 1.55], p &lt; 0.001); stomach (RR = 1.59, 95% CI [1.36, 1.86], p 
&lt; 0.001); and bladder (RR = 1.40, 95% CI [1.25, 1.56], p &lt; 0.001), cancers 
were observed in significant excess among individuals at high-risk for AD after 
correction for multiple testing. (5) Conclusions and Relevance: Since age is the 
greatest risk factor for the development of AD, individuals who reach more 
advanced ages are at increased risk of developing AD. Consistent with this, 
people with fewer comorbidities earlier in life are more likely to reach an age 
where AD becomes a larger risk. Our findings show that individuals at high risk 
for AD have a decreased incidence of various other diseases. This is further 
supported by our finding that our high-risk group was also found to have an 
increased incidence of various cancers, which also increase in risk with age. 
There is the possibility that a more meaningful or etiological relationship 
exists among these various comorbidities. Further research into the etiological 
relationship between AD and these comorbidities may elucidate these possible 
interactions."
1867,"BACKGROUND: In Poland, breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed 
cancer in women and the second most common cause of death after lung cancer. 
This disease has important economic implications for patients, public payers, 
and the whole Polish economy. This study aimed to estimate the total National 
Health Fund (NHF) expenditures on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with 
breast cancer. In addition, the costs of productivity losses were also 
calculated.
METHODS: Cost estimation was prepared using a top-down approach. Direct cost 
calculations were based on data reported by NHF for patients with the diagnosis 
of breast cancer. Medical care costs included the following components: 
screening program, oncological package, surgical treatment, hospitalization, 
drug program, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and outpatient care. Indirect costs in 
the form of absenteeism costs were calculated based on data from Statistics 
Poland (gross domestic product, number of employees) and the Social Insurance 
Institution database (the number of sick leave days).
RESULTS: Total expenditures for BC including direct costs and indirect costs 
amounted to EUR 305,371, EUR 332,998, and EUR 344,649, respectively in 2017, 
2018, and 2019. Total healthcare costs in 2019 were EUR 4114 lower than in 2018, 
which resulted from the reduction in expenditure on the drug program (decrease 
of EUR 13,527), despite the observed increase in all remaining resources. From 
direct costs, the highest expense was spent on the drug program (nearly 50% of 
total direct costs), but this expense dropped significantly in 2019. For the 
remaining parameters, the costs increased year by year, of which the most 
expensive were surgical treatment (15%), radiotherapy (12%), and the screening 
program (10%). BC generated over EUR 120 thousand of social costs in 2019 and 
compared to 2017, there was an increase in productivity loss by 26%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results from 2017-2019 demonstrated that total expenditure for 
BC in Poland increased from year to year. Breast cancer generated almost EUR 345 
thousand expenses in 2019, which translates into a significant burden on the 
public payer's budget and the society in Poland."
1868,"For the first time in the territory of the Russian Far East, a study related to 
the establishment of correlations between air quality and public health in 
Ulan-Ude (Buryatia, Russia) was carried out. This study is based on the analysis 
of official medical statistics on morbidity over several years, the data on the 
composition and volume of emissions of harmful substances into the air from 
various stationary sources, and laboratory measurements of air pollutants in 
different locations in Ulan-Ude. This study confirmed that the morbidity of the 
population in Ulan-Ude has been increasing every year and it is largely 
influenced by air pollutants, the main of which are benzo(a)pyrene, suspended 
solids, PM2.5, PM10, and nitrogen dioxide. It was found that the greatest 
contribution to the unfavorable environmental situation is made by three types 
of stationary sources: large heating networks, autonomous sources (enterprises 
and small businesses), and individual households. The main air pollutants whose 
concentrations exceed the limits are benzo(a)pyrene, formaldehyde, suspended 
particles PM2.5, PM10, and nitrogen dioxide. A comprehensive assessment of the 
content of various pollutants in the atmospheric air showed that levels of 
carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks to public health exceeded allowable 
levels. Priority pollutants in the atmosphere of Ulan-Ude whose concentrations 
create unacceptable levels of risk to public health are benzo(a)pyrene, 
suspended solids, nitrogen dioxide, PM2.5, PM10, formaldehyde, and black carbon. 
The levels of morbidity in Ulan-Ude were higher than the average for Buryatia by 
the main disease classes: respiratory organs-by 1.19 times, endocrine system-by 
1.25 times, circulatory system-by 1.11 times, eye diseases-by 1.06 times, 
neoplasms-by 1.47 times, congenital anomalies, and deformations and chromosomal 
aberrations-by 1.63 times. There is an increase in the incidence of risk-related 
diseases of respiratory organs and the circulatory system. A strong correlation 
was found between this growth of morbidity and atmospheric air pollution in 
Ulan-Ude."
1869,"Accurate segmentation of lung nodules from pulmonary computed tomography (CT) 
slices plays a vital role in the analysis and diagnosis of lung cancer. 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance 
in the automatic segmentation of lung nodules. However, they are still 
challenged by the large diversity of segmentation targets, and the small 
inter-class variances between the nodule and its surrounding tissues. To tackle 
this issue, we propose a features complementary network according to the process 
of clinical diagnosis, which made full use of the complementarity and 
facilitation among lung nodule location information, global coarse area, and 
edge information. Specifically, we first consider the importance of global 
features of nodules in segmentation and propose a cross-scale weighted 
high-level feature decoder module. Then, we develop a low-level feature decoder 
module for edge feature refinement. Finally, we construct a complementary module 
to make information complement and promote each other. Furthermore, we weight 
pixels located at the nodule edge on the loss function and add an edge 
supervision to the deep supervision, both of which emphasize the importance of 
edges in segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that our model 
achieves robust pulmonary nodule segmentation and more accurate edge 
segmentation."
1870,"The availability of massive gene expression data has been challenging in terms 
of how to cure, process, and extract useful information. Here, we describe the 
use of entropic measures as discriminating criteria in cancer using the whole 
data set of gene expression levels. These methods were applied in classifying 
samples between tumor and normal type for 13 types of tumors with a high success 
ratio. Using gene expression, ordered by pathways, results in complexity-entropy 
diagrams. The map allows the clustering of the tumor and normal types samples, 
with a high success rate for nine of the thirteen, studied cancer types. Further 
analysis using information distance also shows good discriminating behavior, 
but, more importantly, allows for discriminating between cancer types. Together, 
our results allow the classification of tissues without the need to identify 
relevant genes or impose a particular cancer model. The used procedure can be 
extended to classification problems beyond the reported results."
1871,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the beliefs about cancer treatment, 
outcomes, and screening among adults aged 50-74 in Newfoundland and Labrador and 
whether these beliefs or sociodemographic factors were associated with 
differences in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening behaviours.
METHODS: This analysis uses data collected from an online survey of adults on 
cancer awareness and prevention in NL. Chi-square tests were used to assess 
differences in distributions of beliefs based on CRC screening behaviour. 
Logistic regression was used to identify sociodemographic factors independently 
associated with CRC screening behaviour.
RESULTS: A total of 724 participants were included in the analysis, 57.4% of 
which had ever had CRC screening. Most held positive beliefs about cancer 
outcomes and treatment. Only beliefs about screening affected CRC screening 
behaviour. People who never had CRC screening were more likely to believe their 
worries about what might be found would prevent them from screening (χ2 = 9.380, 
p = 0.009); screening is only necessary if they have symptoms (χ2 = 15.680, p 
&lt; 0.001); and screening has a high risk of leading to unnecessary surgery (χ2 
= 6.824, p = 0.032). Regression identified that men had higher likelihood of 
having had CRC screening than women in our study (OR = 1.689, 95%CI = 
1.135-2.515), as did all age groups compared to ages 50-54. No associations were 
found with the other sociodemographic factors studied.
CONCLUSION: Beliefs about cancer screening appear to play some role in CRC 
screening behaviour, but the absolute effect was small. The relatively few 
sociodemographic associations with screening behaviour suggest that NL's CRC 
screening program is equitably reaching people from different socioeconomic 
backgrounds."
1872,"Medication adherence to hormone therapy (HT) in breast cancer survivors is often 
suboptimal and is affected by a range of factors. Patients are usually 
prescribed different generic formulations of HT drugs and their impact on side 
effects and on adherence and persistence is poorly understood. This study aimed 
to explore women's lived experience of HT medication brand changes (generic 
substitution) and its impact on side effects, quality of life and 
medication-taking behaviors, as well as on adherence and persistence. Nine 
female breast cancer survivors who had previous experience of HT medication 
brand changes participated in the study. Individual, online, semi-structured 
interviews were conducted and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological 
analysis. The findings identified three superordinate themes and nine 
subordinate themes that influenced the lived experience of medication brand 
changes for these patients: (i) experiencing brand changes, (ii) responsiveness 
of health care providers and (iii) future expectations. Women reported negative 
physical and emotional experiences of brand changes, which is often compounded 
by healthcare professionals' lack of information and reassurances, disbelief in 
the worsening of side effects and inconsistent advice regarding generics. These 
have implications for women's self-efficacy for medication-taking behaviors, 
ability to manage side effects and HT adherence and persistence."
1873,"The choice for the most optimal strategy for patients with a cT1-2N0 carcinoma 
of the oral cavity, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or elective neck 
dissection (END), is still open for debate in many head and neck cancer (HNC) 
treatment centers. One of the possible benefits of the less invasive SLNB could 
be reduced neck and shoulder morbidity. Recent studies have shown a benefit in 
favor of SLNB the first year after intervention, but the long-term consequences 
and differences in neck morbidity remain unclear. This cross-sectional study 
aimed to research differences in neck and shoulder morbidity and Health-Related 
Quality of Life (HR-QoL) in patients with a cT1-2N0 carcinoma of the oral 
cavity, treated with either END or SLNB. Neck and shoulder morbidity and HR-QOL 
were measured with patient-reported questionnaires (SDQ, SPADI, NDI, NDII, 
EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-HN35) and active range of motion (AROM) measurements. 
In total 18 patients with END and 20 patients with SLNB were included. We found 
no differences between END and SLNB for long-term neck morbidity, shoulder 
morbidity, and HR-QOL. The significant differences found in the rotation of the 
neck are small and not clinically relevant."
1874,"Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) cause serious infections 
and aggravate disease progression. Last resort antibiotics are effective against 
MDR-GNB and are reimbursed by flat rates based on German diagnosis-related 
groups (G-DRG). From a hospital management perspective, this analysis compared 
hospital reimbursement for last resort antibiotics with their acquisition costs 
to outline potential funding gaps. Retrospective analyses based on medical 
charts and real-life reimbursement data included patients with pneumonia due to 
MDR-GNB treated in intensive care units (ICU) of a German tertiary care hospital 
(University Hospital Cologne) between January 2017 and December 2020. 
Drug-associated hospital reimbursement of G-DRG was compared with drug 
acquisition costs based on preliminarily approved last resort antibiotics 
(cefiderocol, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and 
imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam) according to label. Funding gaps were determined 
for the treatment of Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter 
baumannii, and mixed infections, respectively. Most of the 31 patients were 
infected with Enterobacterales (n = 15; 48.4%) and P. aeruginosa (n = 13; 
41.9%). Drug-associated G-DRG reimbursement varied from 44.50 EUR (mixed 
infection of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales) to 2265.27 EUR (P. aeruginosa; 
mixed infection of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales). Drug acquisition costs 
ranged from 3284.40 EUR in ceftazidime-avibactam (minimum duration) to 15,827.01 
EUR for imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam (maximum duration). Underfunding was 
found for all MDR-GNB, reaching from 1019.13 EUR (P. aeruginosa; mixed infection 
of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales) to 14,591.24 EUR (Enterobacterales). This 
analysis revealed the underfunding of last resort antibiotics in German hospital 
treatment. Insufficient reimbursement implies less research in this field, 
leading to a more frequent use of inappropriate antibiotics. The cycle closes as 
this contributes to the development of multi-drug resistant bacteria."
1875,"Adolescents and young women (AYA) with breast cancer represent a unique patient 
population, compared to the general population with breast cancer. We performed 
a literature review to evaluate the factors that influenced the surgical 
outcomes in this patient population. Fifty-two studies were identified, which 
evaluated breast surgery type, axillary surgery, contralateral prophylactic 
mastectomy (CPM), surgical timing, psychological factors, disparities, and 
imaging use. AYA patients had equivalent oncologic outcomes with breast 
conserving surgery (BCS) or mastectomy. CPM did not improve survival. There are 
limited data on axillary management in the AYA population, and while more data 
would be beneficial, this is currently extrapolated from the general breast 
cancer population. A shorter time to initiate treatment correlated to better 
outcomes, and disparities need to be overcome for optimal outcomes. AYA patients 
appreciated involvement in clinical decisions, and shared decision making should 
be considered whenever possible. Providers must keep these factors in mind when 
counseling AYA patients, regarding the surgical management of breast cancer."
1876,"BACKGROUND: Regular mammogram screenings have contributed to early breast cancer 
(BC) diagnoses and lowered the mortality rate by 40% in the United States of 
America (USA). Nonetheless, ethnic women living in developed countries, such as 
immigrant Muslim Arab women (IMAW), are less likely to get mammograms.
AIM OF THE STUDY: In our study, we aimed to understand health behaviors among 
IMAWs as understudied populations in the USA.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study on a convenience sample of IMAW 
living in southern California. We used logistic regression and multivariate 
logistic regressions to analyze the data.
RESULTS: The total number of participants who completed the survey was 184 IMAW. 
Participants who had a higher level of knowledge about BC signs and symptoms and 
mammogram knowledge were more likely to have obtained a mammogram at some point 
compared with their counterparts (OR = 1.23, p = 0.03, CI: 1.07-1.42; OR = 2.23, 
p = 0.23, CI: 1.11-4.46, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide more evidence emphasizing the important 
influence of BC and mammogram knowledge on immigrant women's behavior regarding 
mammogram utilization. The average level of knowledge in all three domains (BC 
risk factors, BC signs and symptoms, and mammogram use) reported in this study 
is considered low."
1877,"This retrospective cohort study clarified associations between trajectories in 
palliative care and appetite loss among older patients with advanced 
unresectable pancreatic cancer and reviewed pancreatic cancer diagnosis among 
these populations in rural community hospitals. Patients aged &gt;65 years and 
with pancreatic cancer in a rural community hospital were enrolled. The primary 
outcome was survival duration from the time of pancreatic cancer diagnosis. 
Participants were divided into those with and without appetite loss. Cumulative 
event-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, 
analyzed using the log-rank test, and stratified by factors with statistically 
significant between-group differences (serum albumin). The mean participant age 
was 84.14 (SD, 8.34) years; 31.4% were men. Significant between-group 
differences were noted in albumin concentration and survival duration. 
Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant between-group difference in survival 
probability (p &lt; 0.001). Survival duration significantly differed after 
stratification by albumin level (p &lt; 0.001). Appetite loss may be a useful 
symptom for predicting mortality among older patients with unresectable 
pancreatic cancer, and hypoalbuminemia may accelerate deterioration in their 
conditions. Accordingly, subjective appetite loss observed by patients and 
families should be assessed to predict mortality, and it is advisable for 
physicians to promptly discuss relevant and advanced directives at appropriate 
timings."
1878,"Smoking is considered a major risk factor in the development of lung diseases 
worldwide. Active smoking and secondhand (passive) smoke (SHS) are related to 
lung cancer (LC) risk. Oxidative stress (OS) and/or lipid peroxidation (LP) 
induced by cigarette smoke (CS) are found to be involved in the pathogenesis of 
LC. Meta-analyses and other case-control/prospective cohort studies are 
inconclusive and have yielded inconsistent results concerning the protective 
role of dietary vitamins C and E, retinol, and iron intake against LC risk in 
smokers and/or non-smokers. Furthermore, the role of vitamins and minerals as 
antioxidants with the potential in protecting LC cells against CS-induced OS in 
smokers and non-smokers has not been fully elucidated. Thus, this review aims to 
summarize the available evidence reporting the relationships between dietary 
antioxidant intake and LC risk in smokers and non-smokers that may be used to 
provide suggestions for future research."
1879,"Care in oncology requires both technical and psychosocial skills by nursing 
staff, so continuous learning is necessary. Evidence suggests there are some 
educational gaps in oncology nursing staff, and continuing educational 
interventions have been effective in overcoming these deficiencies. Aim: to 
determine the basic educational lines that a continuous training program should 
have for oncology nurses. A bibliographic review study was carried out in two 
phases from October 2020 to January 2021. In a first phase, the main databases 
were analyzed: PubMed, Web of Science, Dialnet and Medline, following the PRISMA 
methodology; and subsequently, an analysis of the most important thematic nuclei 
that a training program in cancer nursing should contain. The DAFO matrix and 
the Hanlon prioritization method were used. Four competencies that every 
oncology nurse should have were described: communication, coping, self-direction 
of learning and technical health. The thematic contents that a training program 
should contain were then determined, and aspects such as stress prevention and 
burnout, adequate communication with patient and family, and continuous 
educational and technical skills were considered. The results found suggest that 
there are deficiencies in the education of nursing staff. Continuing education 
programs are effective in supplementing them. They should develop the four 
skills described in the results section."
1880,"Motivation: The price of medical treatment continues to rise due to (i) an 
increasing population; (ii) an aging human growth; (iii) disease prevalence; 
(iv) a rise in the frequency of patients that utilize health care services; and 
(v) increase in the price. Objective: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is already 
well-known for its superiority in various healthcare applications, including the 
segmentation of lesions in images, speech recognition, smartphone personal 
assistants, navigation, ride-sharing apps, and many more. Our study is based on 
two hypotheses: (i) AI offers more economic solutions compared to conventional 
methods; (ii) AI treatment offers stronger economics compared to AI diagnosis. 
This novel study aims to evaluate AI technology in the context of healthcare 
costs, namely in the areas of diagnosis and treatment, and then compare it to 
the traditional or non-AI-based approaches. Methodology: PRISMA was used to 
select the best 200 studies for AI in healthcare with a primary focus on cost 
reduction, especially towards diagnosis and treatment. We defined the diagnosis 
and treatment architectures, investigated their characteristics, and categorized 
the roles that AI plays in the diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms. We 
experimented with various combinations of different assumptions by integrating 
AI and then comparing it against conventional costs. Lastly, we dwell on three 
powerful future concepts of AI, namely, pruning, bias, explainability, and 
regulatory approvals of AI systems. Conclusions: The model shows tremendous cost 
savings using AI tools in diagnosis and treatment. The economics of AI can be 
improved by incorporating pruning, reduction in AI bias, explainability, and 
regulatory approvals."
1881,"Medical image semantic segmentation is essential in computer-aided diagnosis 
systems. It can separate tissues and lesions in the image and provide valuable 
information to radiologists and doctors. The breast ultrasound (BUS) images have 
advantages: no radiation, low cost, portable, etc. However, there are two 
unfavorable characteristics: (1) the dataset size is often small due to the 
difficulty in obtaining the ground truths, and (2) BUS images are usually in 
poor quality. Trustworthy BUS image segmentation is urgent in breast cancer 
computer-aided diagnosis systems, especially for fully understanding the BUS 
images and segmenting the breast anatomy, which supports breast cancer risk 
assessment. The main challenge for this task is uncertainty in both pixels and 
channels of the BUS images. In this paper, we propose a Spatial and Channel-wise 
Fuzzy Uncertainty Reduction Network (SCFURNet) for BUS image semantic 
segmentation. The proposed architecture can reduce the uncertainty in the 
original segmentation frameworks. We apply the proposed method to four datasets: 
(1) a five-category BUS image dataset with 325 images, and (2) three BUS image 
datasets with only tumor category (1830 images in total). The proposed approach 
compares state-of-the-art methods such as U-Net with VGG-16, 
ResNet-50/ResNet-101, Deeplab, FCN-8s, PSPNet, U-Net with information extension, 
attention U-Net, and U-Net with the self-attention mechanism. It achieves 2.03%, 
1.84%, and 2.88% improvements in the Jaccard index on three public BUS datasets, 
and 6.72% improvement in the tumor category and 4.32% improvement in the overall 
performance on the five-category dataset compared with that of the original 
U-shape network with ResNet-101 since it can handle the uncertainty effectively 
and efficiently."
1882,"One of the most prevalent cancers worldwide is skin cancer, and it is becoming 
more common as the population ages. As a general rule, the earlier skin cancer 
can be diagnosed, the better. As a result of the success of deep learning (DL) 
algorithms in other industries, there has been a substantial increase in 
automated diagnosis systems in healthcare. This work proposes DL as a method for 
extracting a lesion zone with precision. First, the image is enhanced using 
Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) to improve 
the image's quality. Then, segmentation is used to segment Regions of Interest 
(ROI) from the full image. We employed data augmentation to rectify the data 
disparity. The image is then analyzed with a convolutional neural network (CNN) 
and a modified version of Resnet-50 to classify skin lesions. This analysis 
utilized an unequal sample of seven kinds of skin cancer from the HAM10000 
dataset. With an accuracy of 0.86, a precision of 0.84, a recall of 0.86, and an 
F-score of 0.86, the proposed CNN-based Model outperformed the earlier study's 
results by a significant margin. The study culminates with an improved automated 
method for diagnosing skin cancer that benefits medical professionals and 
patients."
1883,"In 2020, around 60,000 people were diagnosed with cancer in Portugal, and many 
of them suffered some level of Fear of Progression (FoP) of the disease. 
Although this FoP is realistic, and is part of the normal and appropriate 
response to this type of disease, there is no instrument to assess and 
understand whether it is exaggerated in the face of the situation. The present 
study aimed to translate and validate the Fear of Progression 
Questionnaire-Short Form (FoP-Q-SF) for the Portuguese population. The sample 
consisted of 220 volunteers, aged 18 years or over and diagnosed with cancer for 
at least six months. Participants completed the FoP-Q-SF, the Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression Scale (HADS), the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and 
the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). The 
FoP-Q-SF demonstrated high internal reliability (α = 0.86) and the confirmatory 
factor analysis supported the one-dimensional structure of the FoP-Q-SF. 
Convergent validity was supported with significant positive correlations with 
psychological distress, especially anxiety (0.68). The FoP-Q-SF has been found 
to be a valid instrument to measure FoP in Portuguese cancer survivors."
1884,"Molecular/genomic profiling is the most accurate method to assess prognosis of 
endometrial cancer patients. Radiomic profiling allows for the extraction of 
mineable high-dimensional data from clinical radiological images, thus providing 
noteworthy information regarding tumor tissues. Interestingly, the adoption of 
radiomics shows important results for screening, diagnosis and prognosis, across 
various radiological systems and oncologic specialties. The central hypothesis 
of the prospective trial is that combining radiomic features with molecular 
features might allow for the identification of various classes of risks for 
endometrial cancer, e.g., predicting unfavorable molecular/genomic profiling. 
The rationale for the proposed research is that once validated, radiomics 
applied to ultrasonographic images would be an effective, innovative and 
inexpensive method for tailoring operative and postoperative treatment 
modalities in endometrial cancer. Patients with newly diagnosed endometrial 
cancer will have ultrasonographic evaluation and radiomic analysis of the 
ultrasonographic images. We will correlate radiomic features with 
molecular/genomic profiling to classify prognosis."
1885,"This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of and satisfaction with 
integrative Korean medicine treatment and motion style acupuncture treatment 
(MSAT) in patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH). We retrospectively 
analyzed medical charts and prospectively surveyed adult patients aged between 
19 and 64 years treated for lumbar disc herniation for at least 6 days at three 
Korean hospitals from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2020. The primary outcome 
was the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for back pain. Secondary outcome measures 
included the NRS for radiating leg pain, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), 
and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimension-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. 
The NRS scores for low back pain decreased from 5.40 ± 1.58 to 2.92 ± 2.09, NRS 
for radiating leg pain from 5.57 ± 1.56 to 1.78 ± 2.36, and ODI from 46.39 ± 
16.72 to 16.47 ± 15.61 at baseline and survey, respectively. The EQ-5D-5L 
increased from 0.57 ± 0.19 to 0.82 ± 0.14. In conclusion, Korean medicine and 
MSAT could be effective treatment methods for patients with LDH. The results of 
this study can be used as helpful information for clinicians who treat patients 
with LDH in real clinical settings."
1886,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak disrupted medical access for patients 
receiving chronic opioid therapy. This study investigated their prescription 
opioid dosages before and after the 2020 outbreak in Taiwan.
METHODS: A prospective questionnaire survey was conducted among registered 
outpatients receiving long-term opioids before July 2019 in Taiwan. The 
questionnaire included items from the Taiwanese Brief Pain Inventory and quality 
of life assessment. Follow-up surveys in outpatient departments through October 
2020 were conducted to collect opioid prescription data.
RESULTS: After a mean of 531 days, the questionnaire responses of 103 of the 
initial 117 respondents were reviewed. Daily opioid doses decreased for 31 
respondents (30.1%), remained roughly equivalent (defined as ±2.5%) for 27 
(26.2%), and increased for 45 (43.7%) after the first wave of the pandemic. The 
use of strong opioids and nonopioid medications did not significantly differ 
among the three groups, but less fentanyl patch use was noted in the 
decreased-dose group after the outbreak. More than 70% of the patients received 
daily high-dose opioids (≥90 morphine milligram equivalents); moreover, 60% 
reported constipation. No deaths due to opioid overdose occurred during the 
study period.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 did not interrupt access to long-term 
opioid prescriptions for most registered patients with chronic pain in Taiwan. 
Less fentanyl patch use was observed in participants whose opioid dose was 
tapering."
1887,"The liver is the most common site of colorectal cancer metastasis. Liver surgery 
is a cornerstone in treatment, with progressive expansion of minimally invasive 
surgery (MIS). This study aims to compare short- and long-term outcomes of open 
surgery and MIS for the treatment of colorectal adenocarcinoma liver metastasis 
during the first three years of increasing caseload and implementation of MIS 
use in liver surgery. All patients treated between November 2018 and August 2021 
at Careggi Teaching Hospital in Florence, Italy, were prospectively entered into 
a database and retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-one patients were resected (41 
open, 10 MIS). Considering that patients with a significantly higher number of 
lesions underwent open surgery and operative results were similar, postoperative 
morbidity rate and length of hospital stay were significantly higher in the open 
group. No differences were found in the pathological specimen. The postoperative 
mortality rate was 2%. Mean overall survival and disease-free survival were 46 
months (95% CI 42-50) and 22 months (95% CI 15.6-29), respectively. The use of 
minimally invasive techniques in liver surgery is safe and feasible if surgeons 
have adequate expertise. MIS and parenchymal sparing resections should be 
preferred whenever technically feasible."
1888,"The public demand for popular science knowledge regarding health is increasing, 
and physicians' popular science practices on online medical platforms are 
becoming frequent. Few studies have been conducted to address the relationship 
between specific characteristics of popular science articles by physicians and 
their performance. This study explored the impact of the characteristics of 
popular science articles on physicians' performance based on the elaboration 
likelihood model (ELM) from the central path (topic focus and readability) and 
the peripheral path (form diversity). Data on four diseases, namely, lung 
cancer, brain hemorrhage, hypertension, and depression, were collected from an 
online medical platform, resulting in relevant personal data from 1295 doctors 
and their published popular science articles. Subsequently, the independent 
variables were quantified using thematic analysis and formula calculation, and 
the research model and hypotheses proposed in this paper were verified through 
empirical analysis. The results revealed that the topic focus, readability, and 
form diversity of popular science articles by physicians had a significant 
positive effect on physicians' performance. This study enriches the research 
perspective on the factors influencing physicians' performance, which has 
guiding implications for both physicians and platforms, thereby providing a 
basis for patients to choose physicians and enabling patients to receive popular 
science knowledge regarding health in an effective manner."
1889,"It is very important to use effective parameters in the treatment plan of breast 
cancer patients in TomoDirect (TD)-three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy 
(TD-3DCRT). The objective of this study was to compare the radiation treatment 
plans to the parameters (jaw width and jaw mode) of TD-3DCRT for left-breast 
cancer. This study was conducted using the phantom, the jaw mode (fixed and 
dynamic) and field width (2.5 cm and 5.0 cm) were controlled to compare the 
TD-3DCRT treatment plans. There was small difference in the conformity index 
(CI) and homogeneity index (HI) values for target according to the jaw mode for 
each field width. As a result of observation in terms of dose, treatment time 
and unnecessary damage to surrounding normal organs could be minimized when 
dynamic jaw with a field width of 5.0 cm was used. In conclusion, we verified 
that the use of dynamic jaws and 5.0 cm field width was effective in left-breast 
cancer radiotherapy plan using TD-3DCRT."
1890,"Incorporating scientific research into clinical practice via clinical 
informatics, which includes genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, and 
biostatistics, improves patients' treatment. Computational pathology is a 
growing subspecialty with the potential to integrate whole slide images, 
multi-omics data, and health informatics. Pathology and laboratory medicine are 
critical to diagnosing cancer. This work will review existing computational and 
digital pathology methods for breast cancer diagnosis with a special focus on 
deep learning. The paper starts by reviewing public datasets related to breast 
cancer diagnosis. Additionally, existing deep learning methods for breast cancer 
diagnosis are reviewed. The publicly available code repositories are introduced 
as well. The paper is closed by highlighting challenges and future works for 
deep learning-based diagnosis."
1891,"Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer and genital 
warts and constitutes one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. 
Cervical cancer is the only reproductive cancer that has a primary prevention 
programme through the introduction of HPV vaccinations. Even though the majority 
of European countries have nationally funded HPV vaccination programmes, in 
Poland these are exclusively local and scarcely funded. Moreover, the majority 
of local programmes are directed to females only. Meanwhile, Poland has one of 
the highest cervical cancer incidence rates among high income countries. The aim 
of this study was to measure HPV vaccination levels among final-year students in 
Poland and to establish the association between vaccination status and gender, 
region and level of sexual education received. This study is a part of the POLKA 
18 Study, which used original self-reported paper-based questionnaires 
distributed in schools in six Polish regions. The study was conducted between 
April and December 2019. The obtained data were analysed in STATA 17. In total, 
2701 fully completed questionnaires were collected. Over half of the respondents 
(58.2%) did not know their HPV vaccination status. Only 16.0% of the respondents 
replied that they have been vaccinated against HPV (18.2% of females and 14.5% 
of males). There was no direct association between vaccination status and access 
to 'family life education' classes. The vaccination level significantly differed 
among the different regions of Poland (p &lt; 0.0001), with the Śląskie and 
Wielkopolskie regions achieving the highest rates. At least a quarter of 
adolescents after their sexual debut have not been vaccinated against HPV. 
Regions with immunization programmes introduced to their provincial capitals had 
higher vaccination rates. Our findings indicate the need for the introduction of 
state-funded vaccination programmes at the national level for the vaccination 
rate to increase, which will have the potential to decrease cervical cancer 
incidence in the country."
1892,"Many older adults with cancer prefer to live at home, and home treatment and 
outpatient care have been recommended for such patients. To improve their mental 
health, it is important to identify the challenges that are faced by 
home-dwelling older adults with cancer. This study aimed to examine the impact 
of the home on older adults with advanced cancer who were receiving treatment 
and follow-up care. In a cross-sectional design with criterion-based sampling, 
eight qualitative interviews were transcribed and interpreted thematically. We 
identified three themes of home-safety management: good home-safety management, 
uncertain home-safety management, and home-safety management collapse. Moreover, 
we revealed eight sub-themes important to the participants' home-safety 
experience. Ensuring that older adults feel safe at home will afford them the 
opportunity to enjoy living at home, which in turn may alleviate their symptom 
burden and enhance their mental health."
1893,"According to the Health Promotion Administration in the Ministry of Health and 
Welfare statistics in Taiwan, over ten thousand women have breast cancer every 
year. Mammography is widely used to detect breast cancer. However, it is limited 
by the operator's technique, the cooperation of the subjects, and the subjective 
interpretation by the physician. It results in inconsistent identification. 
Therefore, this study explores the use of a deep neural network algorithm for 
the classification of mammography images. In the experimental design, a 
retrospective study was used to collect imaging data from actual clinical cases. 
The mammography images were collected and classified according to the breast 
image reporting and data-analyzing system (BI-RADS). In terms of model building, 
a fully convolutional dense connection network (FC-DCN) is used for the network 
backbone. All the images were obtained through image preprocessing, a data 
augmentation method, and transfer learning technology to build a mammography 
image classification model. The research results show the model's accuracy, 
sensitivity, and specificity were 86.37%, 100%, and 72.73%, respectively. Based 
on the FC-DCN model framework, it can effectively reduce the number of training 
parameters and successfully obtain a reasonable image classification model for 
mammography."
1894,"BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the most relevant social and health problems in the 
world. The disease entails additional costs for cancer patients and their 
families that are not covered by the public part of our welfare state, and which 
they assume themselves simply because they are ill. The main objective of this 
study is to identify and analyse the additional cost and socioeconomic impact of 
cancer disease on patients diagnosed with cancer disease and their families.
METHODS: Descriptive cross-sectional randomised observational epidemiological 
study without replacement with prevalence of cancer disease in the study base, 
carried out in the Medical Oncology Service of the Complejo Asistencial 
Universitario de Salamanca (CAUSA), Spain.
RESULTS: The study variable has been the additional cost of the cancer disease 
for cancer patients and their families that is not covered by our autonomous 
health system.
CONCLUSIONS: Cancer disease entails an additional cost for the patient and 
family; more specifically, for 55% of the patients in the study sample, the 
diagnosis of cancer represents extra expenditure of between 8.38-9.67% of their 
annual income. Furthermore, the disability and dependence of patients does not 
represent an additional cost due to their levels of functionality, but it can 
have repercussions on the future cost of the evolution of the disease, in 
addition to the fact of having cancer."
1895,"Breast cancer is one of the most widely recognized diseases after skin cancer. 
Though it can occur in all kinds of people, it is undeniably more common in 
women. Several analytical techniques, such as Breast MRI, X-ray, Thermography, 
Mammograms, Ultrasound, etc., are utilized to identify it. In this study, 
artificial intelligence was used to rapidly detect breast cancer by analyzing 
ultrasound images from the Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset (BUSI), which 
consists of three categories: Benign, Malignant, and Normal. The relevant 
dataset comprises grayscale and masked ultrasound images of diagnosed patients. 
Validation tests were accomplished for quantitative outcomes utilizing the 
exhibition measures for each procedure. The proposed framework is discovered to 
be effective, substantiating outcomes with only raw image evaluation giving a 
78.97% test accuracy and masked image evaluation giving 81.02% test precision, 
which could decrease human errors in the determination cycle. Additionally, our 
described framework accomplishes higher accuracy after using multi-headed CNN 
with two processed datasets based on masked and original images, where the 
accuracy hopped up to 92.31% (±2) with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss of 0.05. 
This work primarily contributes to identifying the usefulness of multi-headed 
CNN when working with two different types of data inputs. Finally, a web 
interface has been made to make this model usable for non-technical personals."
1896,"Schizophrenia is a life-shortening disease and life expectancy in patients may 
be 15-20 years shorter than in the general population, with increasing longevity 
gap over time. Premature mortality in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders is mainly 
due to preventable natural causes, such as cardio-vascular disease, infections, 
respiratory tract diseases and cancer, alongside suicide, homicide and 
accidents. There is a complex interplay of factors that act synergistically and 
cause physical morbidity to patients and subsequent mortality. Smoking, 
alcohol/substance abuse and sedentary life style, alongside disease-related 
factors, such as metabolic abnormalities and accelerating aging contribute to 
physical morbidity. Moreover, the symptomatology of psychosis and stigma may 
limit patients' access to quality medical care. Interventions to promote 
physical health in those patients should be multifaceted, and should target all 
patient-related modifiable factors, but also should address service-related 
healthcare disparities. Long-term antipsychotic use (including clozapine and 
long-acting injectables) is associated with substantially decreased all-cause 
mortality, including suicide and cardiovascular mortality, in patients with 
schizophrenia despite the well-known cardiometabolic adverse effects of 
second-generation agents. Integrated care may involve co-location of physical 
and mental health services, liaison services, shared protocols and information 
sharing systems, and has emerged as a way to address the physical health needs 
of those patients. Interventions to address mortality in schizophrenia and 
related syndromes should take place as early as possible in the course of the 
patients' treatment, and could be an integral component of care delivered by 
specialized early intervention services."
1897,"The awareness of healthcare practitioners concerning heated tobacco product 
(HTP) use risks has been evaluated; however, few studies have investigated 
general dental practitioners' awareness regarding HTP-use risks. In this 
cross-sectional study, we investigated dentists' awareness of the risks of 
smoking, particularly HTP use. A self-administered questionnaire, including 
eight questions on conventional cigarette and HTP smoking/using status and both 
knowledge and awareness of HTP-use risks, was posted to 3883 dentists belonging 
to the Aichi Dental Association, Japan, in August 2019. Statistical analysis was 
performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences; statistical 
significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. We analyzed the data of 1317 dentists 
(participation rate, 41.6%). The study group included cigarette smokers (11.5%) 
and HTP users (8.5%), among whom 41.1% were dual users. HTP users were more 
likely than never smokers/users to correctly perceive HTP-use risks (p &lt; 
0.05). This study indicates that in Japan, the proportion of HTP users is higher 
than that of the general population. It is important to educate not only 
smokers/users but also never smokers/users on the risks of smoking and using 
HTPs. Smoking cessation, including ceasing HTP use, and aiming to quit smoking 
and HTP use among dentists would contribute to appropriate smoking cessation 
among patients."
1898,"Brain tumors (BTs) are an uncommon but fatal kind of cancer. Therefore, the 
development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for classifying brain 
tumors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the subject of many research 
papers so far. However, research in this sector is still in its early stage. The 
ultimate goal of this research is to develop a lightweight effective 
implementation of the U-Net deep network for use in performing exact real-time 
segmentation. Moreover, a simplified deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) 
architecture for the BT classification is presented for automatic feature 
extraction and classification of the segmented regions of interest (ROIs). Five 
convolutional layers, rectified linear unit, normalization, and max-pooling 
layers make up the DCNN's proposed simplified architecture. The introduced 
method was verified on multimodal brain tumor segmentation (BRATS 2015) 
datasets. Our experimental results on BRATS 2015 acquired Dice similarity 
coefficient (DSC) scores, sensitivity, and classification accuracy of 88.8%, 
89.4%, and 88.6% for high-grade gliomas. When it comes to segmenting BRATS 2015 
BT images, the performance of our proposed CAD framework is on par with existing 
state-of-the-art methods. However, the accuracy achieved in this study for the 
classification of BT images has improved upon the accuracy reported in prior 
studies. Image classification accuracy for BRATS 2015 BT has been improved from 
88% to 88.6%."
1899,"The purpose of the conference session summarized in this article was to bring 
together international experts on food toxicology and food safety and share the 
current scientific knowledge on these topics. The presentations covered a wide 
range of interdisciplinary issues, including (i) the impact of diet on body 
weight and health outcomes including results from animal models of 
carcinogenesis, (ii) methods for microbial oil extraction, (iii) food processing 
and its impact on food safety and health, (iv) novel compounds to avoid 
mycotoxin contamination of agricultural products, and (v) the safety of 
cannabidiol in food supplements based on Cannabis sativa extracts. Some of the 
conclusions of the presentations included that correct food choices may impact 
on the risk of non-communicable diseases such as cancer, that food processing 
may have an influence on health, by either reducing or increasing risks, and 
that research regarding novel compounds is important, which may have preventive 
but also detrimental effects on health."
1900,"BACKGROUND: sulforaphane is a kind of isothiocyanate, which is obtained by 
hydrolysis of glucosinolate by the unique myrosinase in plants. It has been 
proved to prevent the occurrence of many chronic diseases, such as obesity, 
diabetes and cancer.
OBJECTIVE: The impact of SFN on obese human gut flora, however, has not been 
established.
METHODS: In this research, SFN was isolated from broccoli seeds and then refined 
to achieve 95% purity. Next, an investigation was conducted into the digestion 
and fermentation processes of SFN.
RESULTS: The stability of the SFN in simulated saliva, gastric fluid, and 
intestinal juice provides evidence that it can reach the gut and be available 
for utilization by gut microflora. In vitro fermentation of SFN by gut microbes 
in obese patients results in alteration in constitution of microbiota and 
production of short chain fatty acids. As the result of SFN ingestion by human 
gut bacteria, the content of butyric and valeric acids increased 1.21- and 
1.46-fold, respectively. In obese human guts, the relative abundances of the 
beneficial genera including Lactobacillus, Weissella, Leuconosto, Algiphilus and 
Faecalibacterium significantly increased, whilst the detrimental genera, such as 
Escherichia-Shigella, Klebsiella, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Sutterella, 
Megamonas and Proteus drastically declined.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings demonstrate that SFN can be used as a 
nutraceutical ingredient for obese patients and for improving human health."
1901,"The reuterin system is a complex multi-component antimicrobial system produced 
by Limosilactobacillus reuteri by metabolizing glycerol. The system mainly 
includes 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA, reuterin), 3-HPA dimer, 3-HPA hydrate, 
acrolein and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, and has great potential to be applied in 
the food and medical industries due to its functional versatility. It has been 
reported that the reuterin system possesses regulation of intestinal flora and 
anti-infection, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. Typically, the 
reuterin system exerts strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. However, 
the antimicrobial mechanism of the reuterin system remains unclear, and its 
toxicity is still controversial. This paper presents an updated review on the 
biosynthesis, composition, biological production, antimicrobial mechanisms, 
stability, toxicity and potential applications of the reuterin system. 
Challenges and opportunities of the use of the reuterin system as a food 
preservative or health-promoting agent are also discussed. The present work will 
allow researchers to accelerate their studies toward solving critical challenges 
obstructing industrial applications of the reuterin system."
1902,"Although increasing evidence shows the association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
and colorectal cancer, the related mechanism remains unclear. This study 
examined the suppressive effect of lactoferrin (LF) on the development of 
T2D-induced colon cancer. First, a co-cultured cell model consisting of NCM460 
and HT29 cells was constructed to mimic the progression of T2D into colon 
cancer. The migration ability of NCM460 cells increased significantly (p &lt; 
0.05) after cultivation in HT29 cell medium (high glucose), while LF suppressed 
the progression of T2D to colon cancer by regulating the 5'-nucleotidase 
domain-containing 3 (NT5DC3) protein and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in 
diabetic BALB/c mice and in cell models. A mutation assay of the phosphorylation 
site in the NT5DC3 protein and a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) protein binding 
test were performed to further ascertain a mechanistic link between LF and the 
NT5DC3 protein. The results indicated that LF specifically bound to the NT5DC3 
protein to activate its phosphorylation at the Thr6 and Ser11 sites. Next, 
metabolic-specific staining and localization experiments further confirmed that 
LF acted as a phosphate donor for NT5DC3 protein phosphorylation by regulating 
the downstream metabolic pathway in T2D-induced colon tumors, which was 
specifically accomplished by controlling Thr6/Ser11 phosphorylation in NT5DC3 
and its downstream effectors. These data on LF and NT5DC3 protein may suggest a 
new therapeutic strategy for cancer prevention, especially in T2D patients 
susceptible to colon cancer."
1903,"Using radiogenomics methods, the differences between tumor imaging data and 
genetic data in Chinese and Western breast cancer (BC) patients were analyzed, 
and the correlation between phenotypic data and genetic data was explored. In 
this paper, we analyzed BC patients' image characteristics and transcriptome 
data separately, then correlated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phenotype 
with the transcriptome data through a computational method to develop a 
radiogenomics feature. The data was fed into the designed random forest (RF) 
model, which used the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) as the 
evaluation index. Next, we analyzed the hub genes in the differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) and obtained seven hub genes, which may cause Chinese and 
Western BC patients to behave differently in the clinic. We demonstrated that 
combining relevant genetic data and imaging features could better classify 
Chinese and Western patients than using genes or imaging characteristics alone. 
The AUC values of 0.74, 0.81, and 0.95 were obtained separately using the image 
characteristics, DEGs, and radiogenomics features. We screened SYT4, GABRG2, 
CHGA, SLC6A17, NEUROG2, COL2A1, and MATN4 and found that these genes were 
positively or negatively correlated with certain imaging characteristics. In 
addition, we found that the SLC6A17, NEUROG2, CHGA, and MATN4 genes were 
associated with clinical features."
1904,"Inherited copy number variations (CNVs) can provide valuable information for 
cancer susceptibility and prognosis. However, their association with oropharynx 
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is still poorly studied. Using microarrays 
analysis, we identified three inherited CNVs associated with OPSCC risk, of 
which one was validated in 152 OPSCC patients and 155 controls and related to 
pseudogene-microRNA-mRNA interaction. Individuals with three or more copies of 
ADAM3A and ADAM5 pseudogenes (8p11.22 chromosome region) were under 6.49-fold 
increased risk of OPSCC. ADAM5 shared a highly homologous sequence with the 
ADAM9 3'-UTR, predicted to be a binding site for miR-122b-5p. Individuals 
carrying more than three copies of ADAM3A and ADAM5 presented higher ADAM9 
expression levels. Moreover, patients with total deletion or one copy of 
pseudogenes and with higher expression of miR-122b-5p presented worse prognoses. 
Our data suggest, for the first time, that ADAM3A and ADAM5 pseudogene-inherited 
CNV could modulate OPSCC occurrence and prognosis, possibly through the 
interaction of ADAM5 pseudogene transcript, miR-122b-5p, and ADAM9."
1905,"AIM: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a group of T-cell malignancies that 
develop in the skin. Though studied intensively, the etiology and pathogenesis 
of CTCL remain elusive. This study evaluated the survival of CTCL patients in 
the 1st Department of Dermatovenereology of St. Anne's University Hospital Brno. 
It included analysis of 19 polymorphic gene variants based on their expected 
involvement in CTCL severity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 75 patients with CTCL, evaluated and treated at the 1st 
Department of Dermatovenereology of St. Anne´s University Hospital Brno, Faculty 
of Medicine, Masaryk University, were recruited for the study over the last 28 
years (44 men and 31 women, average age 58 years, range 20-82 years). All 
patients were genotyped for 19 chosen gene polymorphisms by the conventional PCR 
method with restriction analysis. A multivariate Cox regression model was 
calculated to reveal genetic polymorphisms and other risk factors for survival.
RESULTS: The model identified MDR Ex21 2677 (rs2032582) as a significant genetic 
factor influencing the survival of the patients, with the T-allele playing a 
protective role. A multivariate stepwise Cox regression model confirmed the 
following as significant independent risk factors for overall survival: 
increased age at admission, clinical staging of the tumor, and male sex.
CONCLUSION: We showed that the TT genotype at position 2677 of the MDR1 gene 
exhibited statistically significant longer survival in CTCL patients. As such, 
the TT genotype of MDR1 confers a significant advantage for the CTCL patients 
who respond to treatment."
1906,"Understanding the causes of tumorigenesis and progression in triple-receptor 
negative breast cancer (TNBC) can help the design of novel and personalized 
therapies and prognostic assessments. Abnormal RNA modification is a recently 
discovered process in TNBC development. TNBC samples from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas database were categorized according to the expression level of NAT10, 
which drives acetylation of cytidine in RNA to N(4)-acetylcytidine (ac4C) and 
affects mRNA stability. A total of 703 differentially expressed long non-coding 
RNAs (lncRNAs) were found between high- and low-expressed NAT10 groups in TNBC. 
Twenty of these lncRNAs were significantly associated with prognosis. Two breast 
cancer tissues and their paired normal tissues were sequenced at the whole 
genome level using acetylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (acRIP-seq) 
technology to identify acetylation features in TNBC, and 180 genes were 
significantly differentially ac4c acetylated in patients. We also analyzed the 
genome-wide lncRNA expression profile and constructed a co-expression network, 
containing 116 ac4C genes and 1080 lncRNAs. Three of these lncRNAs were 
prognostic risk lncRNAs affected by NAT10 and contained in the network. The 
corresponding reciprocal pairs were ""LINC01614-COL3A1"", ""OIP5-AS1-USP8"", and 
""RP5-908M14.9-TRIR"". These results indicate that RNA ac4c acetylation involves 
lncRNAs and affects the tumor process and prognosis of TNBC. This will aid the 
prediction of drug targets and drug sensitivity."
1907,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a range of motor signs, but 
cognitive dysfunction is also observed. Supplementation with folic acid and 
vitamin B12 is expected to prevent cognitive impairment. To test this in PD, we 
promoted a lesion within the substantia nigra pars compacta of rats using the 
neurotoxin rotenone. In the sequence, the animals were supplemented with folic 
acid and vitamin B12 for 14 consecutive days and subjected to the object 
recognition test. We observed an impairment in object recognition memory after 
rotenone administration, which was prevented by supplementation (p &lt; 0.01). 
Supplementation may adjust gene expression through efficient DNA methylation. To 
verify this, we measured the expression and methylation of the kynureninase gene 
(Kynu), whose product metabolizes neurotoxic metabolites often accumulated in PD 
as kynurenine. Supplementation prevented the decrease in Kynu expression induced 
by rotenone in the substantia nigra (p &lt; 0.05), corroborating the behavioral 
data. No differences were observed concerning the methylation analysis of two 
CpG sites in the Kynu promoter. Instead, we suggest that folic acid and vitamin 
B12 increased global DNA methylation, reduced the expression of Kynu inhibitors, 
maintained Kynu-dependent pathway homeostasis, and prevented the memory 
impairment induced by rotenone. Our study raises the possibility of adjuvant 
therapy for PD with folic acid and vitamin B12."
1908,"Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are toxic lesions that can be generated by exposure 
to genotoxic agents or during physiological processes, such as during V(D)J 
recombination. The repair of these DSBs is crucial to prevent genomic 
instability and to maintain cellular homeostasis. Two main pathways participate 
in repairing DSBs, namely, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous 
recombination (HR). The P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) plays a pivotal role in 
the choice of DSB repair mechanism, promotes checkpoint activation and preserves 
genome stability upon DSBs. By preventing DSB end resection, 53BP1 promotes NHEJ 
over HR. Nonetheless, the balance between DSB repair pathways remains crucial, 
as unscheduled NHEJ or HR events at different phases of the cell cycle may lead 
to genomic instability. Therefore, the recruitment of 53BP1 to chromatin is 
tightly regulated and has been widely studied. However, less is known about the 
mechanism regulating 53BP1 recruitment at a distance from the DNA damage. The 
present review focuses on the mechanism of 53BP1 recruitment to damage and on 
recent studies describing novel mechanisms keeping 53BP1 at a distance from 
DSBs."
1909,"Chronic lung diseases are highly prevalent worldwide and cause significant 
mortality. Lung cancer is the end stage of many chronic lung diseases. RNA 
epigenetics can dynamically modulate gene expression and decide cell fate. 
Recently, studies have confirmed that RNA epigenetics plays a crucial role in 
the developing of chronic lung diseases. Further exploration of the underlying 
mechanisms of RNA epigenetics in chronic lung diseases, including lung cancer, 
may lead to a better understanding of the diseases and promote the development 
of new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. This article reviews basic 
information on RNA modifications, including N6 methylation of adenosine (m6A), 
N1 methylation of adenosine (m1A), N7-methylguanosine (m7G), 5-methylcytosine 
(m5C), 2'O-methylation (2'-O-Me or Nm), pseudouridine (5-ribosyl uracil or Ψ), 
and adenosine to inosine RNA editing (A-to-I editing). We then show how they 
relate to different types of lung disease. This paper hopes to summarize the 
mechanisms of RNA modification in chronic lung disease and finds a new way to 
develop early diagnosis and treatment of chronic lung disease."
1910,"Delayed cancer detection is one of the common causes of poor prognosis in the 
case of many cancers, including cancers of the oral cavity. Despite the 
improvement and development of new and efficient gene therapy treatments, very 
little has been carried out to algorithmically assess the impedance of these 
carcinomas. In this work, from attributes or NCBI's oral cancer datasets, viz. 
(i) name, (ii) gene(s), (iii) protein change, (iv) condition(s), clinical 
significance (last reviewed). We sought to train the number of instances 
emerging from them. Further, we attempt to annotate viable attributes in oral 
cancer gene datasets for the identification of gingivobuccal cancer (GBC). We 
further apply supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to the gene 
datasets, revealing key candidate attributes for GBC prognosis. Our work 
highlights the importance of automated identification of key genes responsible 
for GBC that could perhaps be easily replicated in other forms of oral cancer 
detection."
1911,"Over the last decades, accumulating evidence has shown tumor-dependent profiles 
of miR-708, being either up- or downregulated, and thus, acting as a ""Janus"" 
regulator of oncogenic pathways. Herein, its functional duality was assessed 
through a thorough review of the literature and further validation in silico 
using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
databases. In the literature, miR-708 was found with an oncogenic role in eight 
tumor types, while a suppressor tumor role was described in seven cancers. This 
double profile was also found in TCGA and GEO databases, with some tumor types 
having a high expression of miR-708 and others with low expression compared with 
non-tumor counterparts. The investigation of validated targets using miRBase, 
miRTarBase, and miRecords platforms, identified a total of 572 genes that 
appeared enriched for PI3K-Akt signaling, followed by cell cycle control, p53, 
Apellin and Hippo signaling, endocrine resistance, focal adhesion, and cell 
senescence regulations, which are all recognized contributors of tumoral 
phenotypes. Among these targets, a set of 15 genes shared by at least two 
platforms was identified, most of which have important roles in cancer cells 
that influence either tumor suppression or progression. In a clinical scenario, 
miR-708 has shown to be a good diagnostic and prognosis marker. However, its 
multitarget nature and opposing roles in diverse human tumors, aligned with 
insufficient experimental data and the lack of proper delivery strategies, 
hamper its potential as a sequence-directed therapeutic."
1912,"Transposable elements (TEs) are abundant in genomes. Their mobilization can lead 
to genetic variability that is useful for evolution, but can also have 
deleterious biological effects. Somatic mobilization (SM) has been linked to 
degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer. We used a 
Drosophila simulans strain, in which SM can be measured by counting red spots in 
the eyes, to investigate how chemotherapeutic agents affect expression and SM of 
the mariner TE. Flies were treated with Cisplatin, Dacarbazine, and 
Daunorubicin. After acute exposure, relative expression of mariner was 
quantified by RT-qPCR and oxidative stress was measured by biochemical assays. 
Exposure to 50 and 100 µg/mL Cisplatin increased mariner expression and ROS 
levels; catalase activity increased at 100 µg/mL. With chronic exposure, the 
number of spots also increased, indicating higher mariner SM. Dacarbazine (50 
and 100 µg/mL) did not significantly alter mariner expression or mobilization or 
ROS levels, but decreased catalase activity (100 µg/mL). Daunorubicin (25 and 50 
µM) increased mariner expression, but decreased mariner SM. ROS and catalase 
activity were also reduced. Our data suggest that stress factors may 
differentially affect the expression and SM of TEs. The increase in mariner 
transposase gene expression is necessary, but not sufficient for mariner SM."
1913,"Alström syndrome (ALMS) and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) are rare genetic 
diseases with a number of common clinical features ranging from early-childhood 
obesity and retinal degeneration. ALMS and BBS belong to the ciliopathies, which 
are known to have the expression products of genes, encoding them as 
cilia-localized proteins in multiple target organs. The aim of this study was to 
perform transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on cellular models of ALMS and BBS 
syndromes to identify common and distinct pathological mechanisms present in 
both syndromes. For this purpose, epithelial cells were isolated from the urine 
of patients and healthy subjects, which were then cultured and reprogrammed into 
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The pathways of genes associated with the 
metabolism of lipids and glycosaminoglycan and the transport of small molecules 
were found to be concomitantly downregulated in both diseases, while transcripts 
related to signal transduction, the immune system, cell cycle control and DNA 
replication and repair were upregulated. Furthermore, protein pathways 
associated with autophagy, apoptosis, cilium assembly and Gli1 protein were 
upregulated in both ciliopathies. These results provide new insights into the 
common and divergent pathogenic pathways between two similar genetic syndromes, 
particularly in relation to primary cilium function and abnormalities in cell 
differentiation."
1914,"BACKGROUND: Stemness markers play critical roles in the maintenance of key 
properties of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), including the pluripotency, stemness 
state, and self-renewal capacities, as well as cell fate decision. Some of these 
features are present in cancer stem cells (CSCs). TWIST1, as a bHLH 
transcription factor oncogene, is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) process in both embryonic and cancer development. Our aim in 
this study was to investigate the functional correlation between TWIST1 and the 
involved genes in the process of CSCs self-renewal in human esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma (ESCC) line KYSE-30.
METHODS: TWIST1 overexpression was enforced in the ESCC KYSE-30 cells using 
retroviral vector containing the specific pruf-IRES-GFP-hTWIST1 sequence. 
Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, the mRNA expression profile of 
TWIST1 and the stem cell markers, including BMI1, CRIPTO1, DPPA2, KLF4, SOX2, 
NANOG, and MSI1, were assessed using relative comparative real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Ectopic expression of TWIST1 in KYSE-30 cells resulted in an increased 
expression of TWIST1 compared to control GFP cells by nearly 9-fold. 
Transduction of TWIST1-retroviral particles caused a significant enhancement in 
BMI1, CRIPTO1, DPPA2, KLF4, and SOX2 mRNA expression, approximately 4.5-, 3.2-, 
5.5-, 3.5-, and 3.7-folds, respectively, whereas this increased TWIST1 
expression caused no change in the mRNA expression of NANOG and MSI1 genes.
CONCLUSIONS: TWIST1 gene ectopic expression in KYSE-30 cells enhanced the level 
of cancer stem cell markers' mRNA expression. These results may emphasize the 
role of TWIST1 in the self-renewal process and may corroborate the involvement 
of TWIST1 in the stemness state capacity of ESCC cell line KYSE-30, as well as 
its potential as a therapeutic target."
1915,"Already used for the treatment of some allergic and inflammatory diseases, such 
as asthma or atopic dermatitis, dupilumab has also been approved as add-on 
therapy for patients with CRSwNP, and it could represent the keystone to 
reducing the remission time as well as to improve healing and quality of life. 
On the other hand, the role of miRNAs as potential biomarkers of immune 
modulation is emerging. We analyzed the effects of a short-time treatment with 
dupilumab in patients with CRSwNP, analyzing the immune response modification as 
well as miRNAs modulations. First, in this early observation stage, all patients 
experienced remarkable improvement and were clinically stable. Indeed, we 
observed a significant decrease in CD4+ T cells and a significant reduction in 
total IgE (p &lt; 0.05) and serum IL-8 levels (p &lt; 0.01), indicating a 
reduction in the general inflammatory condition. In addition, we analyzed a 
panel of about 200 circulating miRNAs. After treatment, we noted a significant 
downregulation of hsa-mir-25-3p (p-value = 0.02415) and hsa-mir-185-5p (p-value 
= 0.04547), two miRNAs involved in the proliferation, inflammation, and 
dug-resistance, in accordance with the clinical status of patients. All these 
preliminary data aimed to identify new biomarkers of prognosis, identifiable 
with non-invasive procedures for patients. Further, these patients are still 
under observation, and others with different levels of responsiveness to 
treatment need to be enrolled to increase the statistical data."
1916,"Cytochrome P450 is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of phase 1 xenobiotics, 
toxins, endogenous hormones, and drugs, including those used in COVID-19 
treatment. Cytochrome p450 genes are linked to the pathogenesis of some 
multifactorial traits and diseases, such as cancer, particularly prostate 
cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer. Genotyping was 
performed on 540 supposedly healthy individuals of 5 Finno-Permic populations 
from the territories of the European part of the Russian Federation. There was a 
statistically significant difference between Veps and most of the studied 
populations in the rs4986774 locus of the CYP2D6 gene; data on the rs3892097 
locus of the CYP2D6 gene shows that Izhemsky Komis are different from the 
Mordovian and Udmurt populations."
1917,"To explain the sources of additional cell masses in the evolution of 
multicellular organisms, the theory of carcino-evo-devo, or evolution by tumor 
neofunctionalization, has been developed. The important demand for a new theory 
in experimental science is the capability to formulate non-trivial predictions 
which can be experimentally confirmed. Several non-trivial predictions were 
formulated using carcino-evo-devo theory, four of which are discussed in the 
present paper: (1) The number of cellular oncogenes should correspond to the 
number of cell types in the organism. The evolution of oncogenes, tumor 
suppressor and differentiation gene classes should proceed concurrently. (2) 
Evolutionarily new and evolving genes should be specifically expressed in tumors 
(TSEEN genes). (3) Human orthologs of fish TSEEN genes should acquire 
progressive functions connected with new cell types, tissues and organs. (4) 
Selection of tumors for new functions in the organism is possible. 
Evolutionarily novel organs should recapitulate tumor features in their 
development. As shown in this paper, these predictions have been confirmed by 
the laboratory of the author. Thus, we have shown that carcino-evo-devo theory 
has predictive power, fulfilling a fundamental requirement for a new theory."
1918,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a fatal disease, accounting for 75-85% of 
primary liver cancers. The conclusive research on miR-181c-5p's role in 
hepatocarcinogenesis, whether it has oncogenic effects or acts as a tumor 
repressor, is limited and fluctuating. Therefore, the current study aimed to 
elucidate the role of miR-181c-5p in HCC in silico and in vivo. The 
bioinformatics analysis of miR-181c-5p expression data in HCC using several 
databases strongly shed light on its involvement in HCC development, but also 
confirmed the fluctuating data around its role. miR-181c-5p was proven here to 
have an oncogenic role by increasing HepG2 cells' viability as confirmed by MTT 
analysis. In addition, miR-181c-5p was upregulated in the HCC positive control 
group and progressed the HCC development and malignant features by its forced 
expression in an HCC mouse model by targeted delivery using a LA-PAMAM polyplex. 
This is indicated by the cancerous gross and histological features, and the 
significant increase in liver function biomarkers. The functional enrichment 
bioinformatics analyses of miR-181c-5p-downregulated targets in HCC indicated 
that miR-181c-5p targets were significantly enriched in multiple pathways and 
biological processes involved in HCC development. Fbxl3, an example for 
miR-181c-5p potential targets, downregulation and its correlation with 
miR-181c-5p were validated by qPCR. In conclusion, miR-181c-5p is upregulated in 
HCC and has an oncogenic role enhancing HCC progression."
1919,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative 
bacteria involved in the pathogenic processes leading to mastitis and metritis 
in animals such as dairy cattle. LPS causes cell proliferation associated with 
endometrium inflammation. Former in vitro studies have demonstrated that LPS 
induces an intense stimulation of the proliferation of a pure population of 
bovine endometrial epithelial cells. In a follow-up transcriptomic study based 
on RNA-sequencing data obtained after 24 h exposure of primary bovine 
endometrial epithelial cells to 0, 2, and 8 μg/mL LPS, 752 and 727 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected between the controls and 
LPS-treated samples that encode proteins known to be associated with either 
proliferation or apoptosis, respectively. The present bioinformatic analysis was 
performed to decipher the gene networks involved to obtain a deeper 
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the proliferative and apoptosis 
processes. Our findings have revealed 116 putative transcription factors (TFs) 
and the most significant number of interactions between these TFs and DEGs 
belong to NFKβ1, TP53, STAT1, and HIF1A. Moreover, our results provide novel 
insights into the early signaling and metabolic pathways in bovine endometrial 
epithelial cells associated with the innate immune response and cell 
proliferation to Escherichia coli-LPS infection. The results further indicated 
that LPS challenge elicited a strong transcriptomic response, leading to potent 
activation of pro-inflammatory pathways that are associated with a marked 
endometrial cancer, Toll-like receptor, NFKβ, AKT, apoptosis, and MAPK signaling 
pathways. This effect may provide a mechanistic explanation for the relationship 
between LPS and cell proliferation."
1920,"Cirrhosis is frequently the final stage of disease preceding the development of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is one of the risk factors for HCC. 
Preventive surveillance for early HCC in patients with cirrhosis is advantageous 
for achieving early HCC prevention and diagnosis, thereby enhancing patient 
prognosis and reducing mortality. However, there is no highly sensitive 
diagnostic marker for the clinical surveillance of HCC in patients with 
cirrhosis, which significantly restricts its use in primary care for HCC. To 
increase the accuracy of illness diagnosis, the study of the effective and 
sensitive genetic biomarkers involved in HCC incidence is crucial. In this 
study, a set of 120 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was 
identified in the GSE121248 dataset. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
was constructed among the DEGs, and Cytoscape was used to extract hub genes from 
the network. In TCGA database, the expression levels, correlation analysis, and 
predictive performance of hub genes were validated. In total, 15 hub genes 
showed increased expression, and their positive correlation ranged from 0.80 to 
0.90, suggesting they may be involved in the same signaling pathway governing 
HBV-related HCC. The GSE10143, GSE25097, GSE54236, and GSE17548 datasets were 
used to investigate the expression pattern of these hub genes in the progression 
from cirrhosis to HCC. Using Cox regression analysis, a prediction model was 
then developed. The ROC curves, DCA, and calibration analysis demonstrated the 
superior disease prediction accuracy of this model. In addition, using proteomic 
analysis, we investigated whether these key hub genes interact with the 
HBV-encoded oncogene X protein (HBx), the oncogenic protein in HCC. We 
constructed stable HBx-expressing LO2-HBx and Huh-7-HBx cell lines. 
Co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (Co-IP/MS) results 
demonstrated that CDK1, RRM2, ANLN, and HMMR interacted specifically with HBx in 
both cell models. Importantly, we investigated 15 potential key genes (CCNB1, 
CDK1, BUB1B, ECT2, RACGAP1, ANLN, PBK, TOP2A, ASPM, RRM2, NEK2, PRC1, SPP1, 
HMMR, and DTL) participating in the transformation process of HBV infection to 
HCC, of which 4 hub genes (CDK1, RRM2, ANLN, and HMMR) probably serve as 
potential oncogenic HBx downstream target molecules. All these findings of our 
study provided valuable research direction for the diagnostic gene detection of 
HBV-related HCC in primary care surveillance for HCC in patients with cirrhosis."
1921,"CUB and Sushi Multiple Domains 1 (CSMD1), a tumour suppressor gene, encodes a 
large membrane-bound protein including a single transmembrane domain. This 
transmembrane region has a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site, suggesting 
that CSMD1 is involved in controlling cellular functions. Although the specific 
mechanisms of action for CSMD1 have not yet been uncovered, it has been linked 
to a number of processes including development, complement control, 
neurodevelopment, and cancer progression. In this review, we summarise CSMD1 
functions in the cellular processes involved in the complement system, 
metastasis, and Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and also in the diseases 
schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and cancer. Clarifying the association 
between CSMD1 and the aforementioned diseases will contribute to the development 
of new diagnosis and treatment methods for these diseases. Recent studies in 
certain cancer types, e.g., gastric cancer, oesophageal cancer, and head and 
neck squamous cell carcinomas, have indicated the involvement of CSMD1 in 
response to immunotherapy."
1922,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by 
a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Patients with 
FAP develop up to thousands of colorectal adenomas as well as lesions in the 
upper GI tract. In FAP, the upper digestive lesions include gastric fundic gland 
polyps (FGPs), antrum adenomas, duodenal or small intestinal adenomas, and 
carcinoma. Patients, after colectomy, are still at significant risk for 
extracolonic malignancies. Advances in endoscope resolution and optical 
enhancement technologies allow endoscopists to provide assessments of benign and 
malignant polyps. For this reason, in the past decades, endoscopic resection 
techniques have become the first line of treatment in patients with polyps in 
the upper GI, whereby polyps and even early cancers can be successfully cured. 
In FAP patients, endoscopic ampullectomy appears to be a safe and effective way 
of treating patients with ampullary tumors. According to current indications, 
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stenting of the main 
pancreatic duct follow ampullectomy."
1923,"Background: Chemoresistance is a significant barrier to combating head and neck 
cancer, and decoding this resistance can widen the therapeutic application of 
such chemotherapeutic drugs. This systematic review and meta-analysis explores 
the influence of microRNA (miRNA) expressions on chemoresistance in head and 
neck cancers (HNC). The objective is to evaluate the theragnostic effects of 
microRNA expressions on chemoresistance in HNC patients and investigate the 
utility of miRNAs as biomarkers and avenues for new therapeutic targets. 
Methods: We performed a comprehensive bibliographic search that included the 
SCOPUS, PubMed, and Science Direct bibliographic databases. These searches 
conformed to a predefined set of search strategies. Following the PRISMA 
guidelines, inclusion and exclusion criteria were framed upon completing the 
literature search. The data items extracted were tabulated and collated in MS 
Excel. This spreadsheet was used to determine the effect size estimation for the 
theragnostic effects of miRNA expressions on chemoresistance in HNC, the hazard 
ratio (HR), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The comprehensive 
meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model. Heterogeneity among 
the data collected was assessed using the Q test, Tau2, I2, and Z measures. 
Publication bias of the included studies was checked using the Egger's bias 
indicator test, Orwin and classic fail-safe N test, Begg and Mazumdar rank 
collection test, and Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill methods. Results: After 
collating the data from 23 studies, dysregulation of 34 miRNAs was observed in 
2189 people. These data were gathered from 23 studies. Out of the 34 miRNAs 
considered, 22 were up-regulated, while 12 were down-regulated. The TaqMan 
transcription kits were the most used miRNA profiling platform, and miR-200c was 
seen to have a mixed dysregulation. We measured the overall pooled effect 
estimate of HR to be 1.516 for the various analyzed miRNA at a 95% confidence 
interval of 1.303-1.765, with a significant p-value. The null hypothesis test's 
Z value was 5.377, and the p-value was correspondingly noted to be less than 
0.0001. This outcome indicates that the risk of death is determined to be higher 
in up-regulated groups than in down-regulated groups. Among the 34 miRNAs that 
were investigated, seven miRNAs were associated with an improved prognosis, 
especially with the overexpression of these seven miRNAs (miR15b-5p, miR-548b, 
miR-519d, miR-1278, miR-145, miR-200c, Hsa- miR139-3p). Discussion: The findings 
reveal that intricate relationships between miRNAs' expression and 
chemotherapeutic resistance in HNC are more likely to exist and can be potential 
therapeutic targets. This review suggests the involvement of specific miRNAs as 
predictors of chemoresistance and sensitivity in HNC. The examination of the 
current study results illustrates the significance of miRNA expression as a 
theragnostic biomarker in medical oncology."
1924,"To keep pace with the rapid advancements in molecular genetics and rare diseases 
research, we have updated the list of ectodermal dysplasias based on the latest 
classification approach that was adopted in 2017 by an international panel of 
experts. For this purpose, we searched the databases PubMed and OMIM for the 
term ""ectodermal dysplasia"", referring mainly to changes in the last 5 years. We 
also tried to obtain information about those diseases on which the last 
scientific report appeared more than 15 years ago by contacting the authors of 
the most recent publication. A group of experts, composed of researchers who 
attended the 8th International Conference on Ectodermal Dysplasias and 
additional members of the previous classification panel, reviewed the proposed 
amendments and agreed on a final table listing all 49 currently known ectodermal 
dysplasias for which the molecular genetic basis has been clarified, including 
15 new entities. A newly reported ectodermal dysplasia, linked to the gene LRP6, 
is described here in more detail. These ectodermal dysplasias, in the strict 
sense, should be distinguished from syndromes with features of ectodermal 
dysplasia that are related to genes extraneous to the currently known pathways 
involved in ectodermal development. The latter group consists of 34 syndromes 
which had been placed on the previous list of ectodermal dysplasias, but most if 
not all of them could actually be classified elsewhere. This update should 
streamline the classification of ectodermal dysplasias, provide guidance to the 
correct diagnosis of rare disease entities, and facilitate the identification of 
individuals who could benefit from novel treatment options."
1925,"Cancer is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. A strong 
predisposition to cancer is generally only observed in colorectal cancer (5% of 
cases) and breast cancer (2% of cases). Colorectal cancer is the most common 
cancer with a strong genetic predisposition, but it includes dozens of various 
syndromes. This group includes familial adenomatous polyposis, attenuated 
familial adenomatous polyposis, MUTYH-associated polyposis, NTHL1-associated 
polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis syndrome, Cowden syndrome, 
Lynch syndrome, and Muir-Torre syndrome. The common symptom of all these 
diseases is a very high risk of colorectal cancer, but depending on the 
condition, their course is different in terms of age and range of cancer 
occurrence. The rate of cancer development is determined by its conditioning 
genes, too. Hereditary predispositions to cancer of the intestine are a group of 
symptoms of heterogeneous diseases, and their proper diagnosis is crucial for 
the appropriate management of patients and their successful treatment. Mutations 
of specific genes cause strong colorectal cancer predispositions. Identifying 
mutations of predisposing genes will support proper diagnosis and application of 
appropriate screening programs to avoid malignant neoplasm."
1926,"MiR-21 and miR-375 have been reported as dysregulated in prostate cancer (PCa) 
in multiple previous studies. Still, variable or even opposing data for the 
expression of these microRNAs in PCa were found, and their potential biomarker 
properties remain elusive. In an attempt to clarify their significance as PCa 
biomarkers, as well as to compare different types of specimens as a source of 
relevant microRNAs, we used plasma and matching plasma-derived exosomes from 
patients with PCa and patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Plasma 
and exosomes were obtained from 34 patients with PCa and 34 patients with BPH, 
and their levels of expression of miR-21 and miR-375 were determined by RT-qPCR. 
We found no significant difference in the level of expression of these microRNAs 
in plasma and exosomes between patients with PCa and BPH. The level of exosomal 
miR-21 was elevated in PCa patients with high serum PSA values, as well as in 
patients with aggressive PCa, while for plasma samples, the results remained 
insignificant. For miR-375, we did not find an association with the values of 
standard prognostic parameters of PCa, nor with cancer aggressiveness. 
Therefore, our results support the potential prognostic role of exosomal miR-21 
expression levels in PCa."
1927,"Filamin protein is characterized by an N-terminal actin-binding domain that is 
followed by 24 Ig (immunoglobulin)-like repeats, which act as hubs for 
interactions with a variety of proteins. In humans, this family has been found 
to be involved in cancer cell invasion and metastasis and can be involved in a 
variety of growth signal transduction processes, but it is less studied in 
plants. Therefore, in this study, 54 Filamin gene family members from 23 plant 
species were investigated and divided into two subfamilies: FLMN and GEX2. 
Subcellular localization showed that most of the Filamin gene family members 
were located in the cell membrane. A total of 47 Filamin gene pairs were 
identified, most of which were whole-genome copies. Through the analyses of 
cis-acting elements, expression patterns and quantitative fluorescence, it was 
found that GH_ A02G0519 and GH_ D02G0539 are mainly expressed in the 
reproductive organs of upland cotton, and their interacting proteins are also 
related to the fertilization process, whereas GH_A02G0216 and GH_D02G0235 were 
related to stress. Thus, it is speculated that two genes of the GEX2 subfamily 
(GH_A02G0519 and GH_D02G0539) may be involved in the reproductive development of 
cotton and may affect the fertilization process of cotton. This study provides a 
theoretical basis for the further study of the cotton Filamin gene family."
1928,"Pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) are currently classified into four 
major histotypes, including typical carcinoid (TC), atypical carcinoid (AC), 
large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and small cell lung carcinoma 
(SCLC). This classification was designed to be applied to surgical specimens 
mostly anchored in morphological parameters, resulting in considerable 
overlapping among PNENs, which may result in important challenges for 
clinicians' decisions in the case of small biopsies. Since PNENs originate from 
the neuroectodermic cells, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene 
expression shows promise as biomarkers involved in the genotypic transformation 
of neuroectodermic cells, including mutation burden with the involvement of 
chromatin remodeling genes, apoptosis, and mitosis rate, leading to modification 
in final cellular phenotype. In this situation, additional markers also 
applicable to biopsy specimens, which correlate PNENs subtypes with systemic 
treatment response, are much needed, and current potential candidates are 
neurogenic EMT genes. This study investigated EMT genes expression and its 
association with PNENs histotypes in tumor tissues from 24 patients with PNENs. 
PCR Array System for 84 EMT-related genes selected 15 differentially expressed 
genes among the PNENs, allowing to discriminate TC from AC, LCNEC from AC, and 
SCLC from AC. Functional enrichment analysis of the EMT genes differentially 
expressed among PNENs subtypes showed that they are involved in cellular 
proliferation, extracellular matrix degradation, regulation of cell apoptosis, 
oncogenesis, and tumor cell invasion. Interestingly, four EMT genes (MAP1B, 
SNAI2, MMP2, WNT5A) are also involved in neurological diseases, in brain 
metastasis, and interact with platinum-based chemotherapy and tyrosine-kinase 
inhibitors. Collectively, these findings emerge as an important ancillary tool 
to improve the strategies of histologic diagnosis in PNENs and unveil the four 
EMT genes that can play an important role in driving chemical response in PNENs."
1929,"Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder where an oncogenic 
TP53 germline mutation is inherited by offspring of a carrier parent. p53 is a 
key tumor suppressor regulating cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. 
Unexpectedly, some mutant TP53 carriers remain unaffected, while their children 
develop cancer early in life. To begin unravelling this paradox, the response of 
dermal fibroblasts (dFb) isolated from a child with LFS was compared to those 
from her unaffected father after UV exposure. Phospho-Chk1[S345], a key 
activator of cell cycle arrest, was increased by UV induction in the LFS patient 
compared to their unaffected parent dFb. This result, along with previous 
findings of reduced CDKN1A/p21 UV induction in affected dFb, suggest that cell 
cycle dysregulation may contribute to cancer onset in the affected LFS subject 
but not the unaffected parent. Mutant p53 protein and its promoter binding 
affinity were also higher in dFb from the LFS patient compared to their 
unaffected parent. These results were as predicted based on decreased mutant 
TP53 allele-specific mRNA expression previously found in unaffected dFb. 
Investigation of the potential mechanism regulating this TP53 allele-specific 
expression found that, while epigenetic promoter methylation was not detectable, 
TP53 wild-type mRNA was specifically stabilized in the unaffected dFb. Hence, 
the allele-specific stabilization of wild-type TP53 mRNA may allow an unaffected 
parent to counteract genotoxic stress by means more characteristic of homozygous 
wild-type TP53 individuals than their affected offspring, providing protection 
from the oncogenesis associated with LFS."
1930,"Melanoma is considered to be the most serious and aggressive type of skin 
cancer, and metastasis appears to be the most important factor in its prognosis. 
Herein, we developed a transfer learning-based biomarker discovery model that 
could aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. After applying it to 
the ensemble machine learning model, results revealed that the genes found were 
consistent with those found using other methodologies previously applied to the 
same TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data set. Further novel biomarkers were also 
found. Our ensemble model achieved an AUC of 0.9861, an accuracy of 91.05, and 
an F1 score of 90.60 using an independent validation data set. This study was 
able to identify potential genes for diagnostic classification (C7 and GRIK5) 
and diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers (S100A7, S100A7, KRT14, KRT17, KRT6B, 
KRTDAP, SERPINB4, TSHR, PVRL4, WFDC5, IL20RB) in melanoma. The results show the 
utility of a transfer learning approach for biomarker discovery in melanoma."
1931,"Dysregulation of amino acid metabolism (AAM) is an important factor in cancer 
progression. This study intended to study the prognostic value of AAM-related 
genes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Methods: The mRNA expression profiles of 
LUAD datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) were applied as the training and validation sets. After identifying the 
differentially expressed AAM-related genes, an AAM-related gene signature 
(AAMRGS) was constructed and validated. Additionally, we systematically analyzed 
the differences in immune cell infiltration, biological pathways, immunotherapy 
response, and drug sensitivity between the two AAMRGS subgroups. Results: The 
prognosis-related signature was constructed on the grounds of key AAM-related 
genes. LUAD patients were divided into AAMRGS-high and -low groups. Patients in 
the two subgroups differed in prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME), 
biological pathways, and sensitivity to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and calibration curves showed 
good predictive ability for the nomogram. Analysis of immune cell infiltration 
revealed that the TME of the AAMRGS-low group was in a state of immune 
activation. Conclusion: We constructed an AAMRGS that could effectively predict 
prognosis and guide treatment strategies for patients with LUAD."
1932,"Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed necrotic cell death, but its 
potential prognostic value in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. On 
the basis of available AML data from TCGA and TARGET databases, a 10-gene 
signature model was constructed to effectively predict AML prognosis by 
performing LASSO Cox regression analysis, which showed that patients with a 
low-risk score had a significantly better prognosis than that of the high-risk 
group, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis achieved superior 
performance in the prognostic model. The model was further well-verified in an 
external GEO cohort. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that, in 
addition to age, the risk score was an independent poor survival factor for AML 
patients, and a nomogram model was constructed with high accuracy. Moreover, the 
high-risk group generally had higher cytolytic activity and increased levels of 
infiltrating immune cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and 
regulatory T cells (Tregs), which could be related to the expression of immune 
checkpoint genes. Additionally, low-risk AML patients may have a better response 
from traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. In conclusion, a pyroptosis-related 
gene signature can independently predict the prognosis of AML patients with 
sufficient predictive power, and pyroptosis plays an important role in the 
immune microenvironment of AML, which may be used to develop a new effective 
therapeutic method for AML in the future."
1933,"(1) Background: tumor profiling enables patient survival prediction. The two 
essential parameters to be calibrated when designing a study based on tumor 
profiles from a cohort are the sequencing depth of RNA-seq technology and the 
number of patients. This calibration is carried out under cost constraints, and 
a compromise has to be found. In the context of survival data, the goal of this 
work is to benchmark the impact of the number of patients and of the sequencing 
depth of miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq on the predictive capabilities for both the Cox 
model with elastic net penalty and random survival forest. (2) Results: we first 
show that the Cox model and random survival forest provide comparable prediction 
capabilities, with significant differences for some cancers. Second, we 
demonstrate that miRNA and/or mRNA data improve prediction over clinical data 
alone. mRNA-seq data leads to slightly better prediction than miRNA-seq, with 
the notable exception of lung adenocarcinoma for which the tumor miRNA profile 
shows higher predictive power. Third, we demonstrate that the sequencing depth 
of RNA-seq data can be reduced for most of the investigated cancers without 
degrading the prediction abilities, allowing the creation of independent 
validation sets at a lower cost. Finally, we show that the number of patients in 
the training dataset can be reduced for the Cox model and random survival 
forest, allowing the use of different models on different patient subgroups."
1934,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the main cause of mortality among 
gynecological malignancies worldwide. Although patients with EOC undergo 
aggregate treatment, the prognosis is often poor. Peritoneal malignant ascites 
is a distinguishable clinical feature in EOC patients and plays a pivotal role 
in tumor progression and recurrence. The mechanisms of the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) in ascites in the regulation of tumor progression need to 
be explored. We comprehensively analyzed the transcriptomes of 4680 single cells 
from five EOC patients (three diagnostic samples and two recurrent samples) 
derived from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Batch effects between 
different samples were removed using an unsupervised deep embedding single-cell 
cluster algorithm. Subcluster analysis identified the different phenotypes of 
cells. The transition of a malignant cell state was confirmed using pseudotime 
analysis. The landscape of TME in malignant ascites was profiled during EOC 
progression. The transformation of epithelial cancer cells into mesenchymal 
cells was observed to lead to the emergence of related anti-chemotherapy and 
immune escape phenotypes. We found the activation of multiple biological 
pathways with the transition of tumor-associated macrophages and fibroblasts, 
and we identified the infiltration of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells in recurrent 
samples. The cell adhesion molecules mediated by integrin might be associated 
with the formation of the tumorsphere. Our study provides novel insights into 
the remodeling of the TME heterogeneity in malignant ascites during EOC 
progression, which provides evidence for identifying novel therapeutic targets 
and promotes the development of ovarian cancer treatment."
1935,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the 
etiological agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has 
affected the lives of billions and killed millions of infected people. This 
virus has been demonstrated to have different outcomes among individuals, with 
some of them presenting a mild infection, while others present severe symptoms 
or even death. The identification of the molecular states related to the 
severity of a COVID-19 infection has become of the utmost importance to 
understanding the differences in critical immune response. In this study, we 
computationally processed a set of publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq 
(scRNA-Seq) data of 12 Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) samples diagnosed as 
having a mild, severe, or no infection, and generated a high-quality dataset 
that consists of 63,734 cells, each with 23,916 genes. We extended the cell-type 
and sub-type composition identification and our analysis showed significant 
differences in cell-type composition in mild and severe groups compared to the 
normal. Importantly, inflammatory responses were dramatically elevated in the 
severe group, which was evidenced by the significant increase in macrophages, 
from 10.56% in the normal group to 20.97% in the mild group and 34.15% in the 
severe group. As an indicator of immune defense, populations of T cells 
accounted for 24.76% in the mild group and decreased to 7.35% in the severe 
group. To verify these findings, we developed several artificial neural networks 
(ANNs) and graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) models. We showed that the 
GCNN models reach a prediction accuracy of the infection of 91.16% using data 
from subtypes of macrophages. Overall, our study indicates significant 
differences in the gene expression profiles of inflammatory response and immune 
cells of severely infected patients."
1936,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex disease involving altered 
interactomes of transcripts and proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small-noncoding 
RNAs that can interact with specific gene transcripts and an array of other 
vital endogenous non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can influence gene expression. 
Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3) is an imprinted lncRNA that is reported to be 
downregulated in HCC (in both cell lines and tumors). Alcohol Dehydrogenase 4 
(ADH4) is a well-known prognostic protein biomarker for predicting the survival 
outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma whose expression is regulated 
by miR-664a-3p, which is upregulated in HCC. In this study, we performed a 
battery of robust and systematic in silico analyses to predicate the possible 
lncRNA-miRNA interactions between MEG3, miR-664a-3p, and ADH4. miRNA-mRNA and 
lncRNA-miRNA hybrid structures were primarily obtained, and the minimum free 
energies (MFEs) for the 3'UTR (Untranslated Regions) of ADH4-miR-664a-3p and the 
3'UTR of MEG3-miR-664a-3p interactions were assessed to predict the stability of 
the obtained RNA heteroduplex hybrids. The hybrid with the least minimum free 
energy (MFE) was considered to be the most favorable. The MFEs were around -28.1 
kcal/mol and -31.3 kCal/mol for the ADH4-miR-664a-3p and MEG3-miR-66a-3p RNA 
hybrids, respectively. This demonstrated that lncRNA-MEG3 might be a competitive 
endogenous RNA that acts as a molecular sponge for miR-664a-3p. In summary, our 
interaction analyses results predict the significance of the 
MEG3/miR-664a-3p/ADH4 axis, where MEG3 downregulation results in miR-664a-3p 
overexpression and the subsequential underexpression of ADH4 in HCC, as a novel 
axis of interest that demands further validation."
1937,"Necroptosis is a newly developed cell death pathway that differs from necrosis 
and apoptosis; however, the potential mechanism of necroptosis-related genes in 
EAC and whether they are associated with the prognosis of EAC patients remain 
unclear. We obtained 159 NRGs from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) and performed differential expression analysis of the NRGs in 9 normal 
samples and 78 EAC tumor samples derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 
Finally, we screened 38 differentially expressed NRGs (DE-NRGs). The results of 
the GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the DE-NRGs were mainly enriched in the 
functions and pathways associated with necroptosis. Protein interaction network 
(PPI) analysis revealed that TNF, CASP1, and IL-1B were the core genes of the 
network. A risk score model based on four DE-NRGs was constructed by Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, and the results 
showed that the higher the risk score, the worse the survival. The model 
achieved more efficient diagnosis compared with the clinicopathological 
variables, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
of 0.885. The prognostic value of this model was further validated using Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) 
demonstrated that several metabolism-related pathways were activated in the 
high-risk population. Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) provided further confirmation 
that this prognostic model was remarkably associated with the immune status of 
EAC patients. Finally, the nomogram map exhibited a certain prognostic 
prediction efficiency, with a C-index of 0.792 and good consistency. Thus, the 
prognostic model based on four NRGs could better predict the prognosis of EAC 
and help to elucidate the mechanism of necroptosis-related genes in EAC, which 
can provide guidance for the target prediction and clinical treatment of EAC 
patients."
1938,"The molecular mechanisms and gene regulatory networks sustaining cell 
proliferation in neuroblastoma (NBL) cells are still not fully understood. In 
this tumor context, it has been proposed that anti-proliferative drugs, such as 
the pan-HDAC inhibitor panobinostat, could be tested to mitigate tumor 
progression. Here, we set out to investigate the effects of panobinostat 
treatment at the unprecedented resolution offered by single-cell sequencing. We 
identified a global senescence signature paired with reduction in proliferation 
in treated Kelly cells and more isolated transcriptional responses compatible 
with early neuronal differentiation. Using master regulator analysis, we 
identified BAZ1A, HCFC1, MAZ, and ZNF146 as the transcriptional regulators most 
significantly repressed by panobinostat. Experimental silencing of these 
transcription factors (TFs) confirmed their role in sustaining NBL cell 
proliferation in vitro."
1939,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the five most common cancers in the world and 
unfortunately has a high mortality rate. To date, the pathogenesis and disease 
genes of GC are unclear, so the need for new diagnostic and prognostic 
strategies for GC is undeniable. Despite particular findings in this regard, a 
holistic approach encompassing molecular data from different biological levels 
for GC has been lacking. To translate Big Data into system-level biomarkers, in 
this study, we integrated three different GC gene expression data with three 
different biological networks for the first time and captured biologically 
significant (i.e., reporter) transcripts, hub proteins, transcription factors, 
and receptor molecules of GC. We analyzed the revealed biomolecules with 
independent RNA-seq data for their diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. While 
this holistic approach uncovered biomolecules already associated with GC, it 
also revealed novel system biomarker candidates for GC. Classification 
performances of novel candidate biomarkers with machine learning approaches were 
investigated. With this study, AES, CEBPZ, GRK6, HPGDS, SKIL, and SP3 were 
identified for the first time as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker 
candidates for GC. Consequently, we have provided valuable data for further 
experimental and clinical efforts that may be useful for the diagnosis and/or 
prognosis of GC."
1940,"Neurological phenotypes such as intellectual disability occur in almost half of 
patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). Current genotype-phenotype studies have 
failed to reveal the mechanism underlying this clinical variability. Despite the 
presence of pathogenic variants of NF1, modifier genes likely determine the 
occurrence and severity of neurological phenotypes. Exome sequencing data were 
used to identify genetic variants in 13 NF1 patients and 457 healthy controls, 
and this information was used to identify candidate modifier genes underlying 
neurological phenotypes based on an optimal sequence kernel association test. 
Thirty-six genes were identified as significant modifying factors in patients 
with neurological phenotypes and all are highly expressed in the nervous system. 
A review of the literature confirmed that 19 genes including CUL7, DPH1, and 
BCO1 are clearly associated with the alteration of neurological functioning and 
development. Our study revealed the enrichment of rare variants of 19 genes 
closely related to neurological development and functioning in NF1 patients with 
neurological phenotypes, indicating possible modifier genes and variants 
affecting neurodevelopment. Further studies on rare genetic variants of 
candidate modifier genes may help explain the clinical heterogeneity of NF1."
1941,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. 
CRC recurrence and metastasis cause poor prognosis. ANGPTLs (angiopoietin-like 
proteins) are a family of proteins that are widely involved in metabolic disease 
and tumorigenesis. The roles of ANGPTLs in CRC are still controversial and 
deserve further research. In this study, several databases were employed to 
explore the expression profiles, prognostic values, genetic alterations, 
potential biological function, and immune infiltration correlation of ANGPTLs in 
CRC. The expression of ANGPTL4 was significantly positively correlated with the 
stage of CRC. Therefore, cell and molecular experiments were further performed 
to explore the roles of ANGPTL4. Our results showed that the transcriptions of 
ANGPTLs in colon cancer and rectal cancer tissues were lower than those in 
normal tissues, but the protein expression varied among different ANGPTLs. In 
addition, the high expression of ANGPTLs led to a relatively poor oncological 
outcome. Specifically, the expression of ANGPTL4 is significantly positively 
correlated with the stage of CRC. Further investigation revealed that ANGPTLs 
are mainly involved in signal transduction and the regulation of transcription, 
while KEGG pathway analyses demonstrated pathways in cancer. Additionally, we 
also observed that ANGPTL4 could promote the proliferation and migration of CRC 
cells, and four specific small molecule compounds had potential ANGPTL4-binding 
capabilities, suggesting the clinical application of these small molecule 
compounds on CRC treatment. Our findings imply the prognostic values and 
potential therapeutic targets of ANGPTLs in CRC."
1942,"BACKGROUND: One of the most frequent malignancies of the digestive system is 
stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). Recent research has demonstrated how cuproptosis 
(copper-dependent cell death) differs from other cell death mechanisms that were 
previously understood. Cuproptosis regulation in tumor cells could be a 
brand-new treatment strategy. Our goal was to create a cuproptosis-related 
lncRNA signature. Additionally, in order to evaluate the possible 
immunotherapeutic advantages and drug sensitivity, we attempted to study the 
association between these lncRNAs and the tumor immune microenvironment of STAD 
tumors.
METHODS: The TCGA database was accessed to download the RNA sequencing data, 
genetic mutations, and clinical profiles for TCGA STAD. To locate lncRNAs 
related to cuproptosis and build risk-prognosis models, three techniques were 
used: co-expression network analysis, Cox-regression techniques, and LASSO 
techniques. Additionally, an integrated methodology was used to validate the 
models' predictive capabilities. Then, using GO and KEGG analysis, we discovered 
the variations in biological functions between each group. The link between the 
risk score and various medications for STAD treatment was estimated using the 
tumor mutational load (TMB) and tumor immune dysfunction and rejection (TIDE) 
scores.
RESULT: We gathered 22 genes linked to cuproptosis based on the prior 
literature. Six lncRNAs related to cuproptosis were used to create a prognostic 
marker (AC016394.2, AC023511.1, AC147067.2, AL590705.3, HAGLR, and LINC01094). 
After that, the patients were split into high-risk and low-risk groups. A 
statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two groups 
was visible in the survival curves. The risk score was demonstrated to be an 
independent factor affecting the prognosis by both univariate and multivariate 
Cox regression analysis. Different risk scores were substantially related to the 
various immunological states of STAD patients, as further evidenced by immune 
cell infiltration and ssGSEA analysis. The two groups had differing burdens of 
tumor mutations. In addition, immunotherapy was more effective for STAD patients 
in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group, and risk scores for STAD were 
substantially connected with medication sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a marker for six cuproptosis-associated lncRNAs 
linked to STAD as prognostic predictors, which may be useful biomarkers for risk 
stratification, evaluation of possible immunotherapy, and assessment of 
treatment sensitivity for STAD."
1943,"E-cadherin, a CDH1 gene product, is a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion 
molecule playing a critical role in the establishment of epithelial 
architecture, maintenance of cell polarity, and differentiation. Germline 
pathogenic variants in the CDH1 gene are associated with hereditary diffuse 
gastric cancer (HDGC), and large rearrangements in the CDH1 gene are now being 
reported as well. Because CDH1 pathogenic variants could be associated with 
breast cancer (BC) susceptibility, CDH1 rearrangements could also impact it. The 
aim of our study is to identify rearrangements in the CDH1 gene in 148 BC cases 
with no BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants. To do so, a zoom-in CGH array, 
covering the exonic, intronic, and flanking regions of the CDH1 gene, was used 
to screen our cohort. Intron 2 of the CDH1 gene was specifically targeted 
because it is largely reported to include several regulatory regions. As 
results, we detected one large rearrangement causing a premature stop in exon 3 
of the CDH1 gene in a proband with a bilateral lobular breast carcinoma and a 
gastric carcinoma (GC). Two large rearrangements in the intron 2, a deletion and 
a duplication, were also reported only with BC cases without any familial 
history of GC. No germline rearrangements in the CDH1 coding region were 
detected in those families without GC and with a broad range of BC 
susceptibility. This study confirms the diversity of large rearrangements in the 
CDH1 gene. The rearrangements identified in intron 2 highlight the putative role 
of this intron in CDH1 regulation and alternative transcripts. Recurrent 
duplication copy number variations (CNV) are found in this region, and the 
deletion encompasses an alternative CDH1 transcript. Screening for large 
rearrangements in the CDH1 gene could be important for genetic testing of BC."
1944,"As a relict plant, Taxus is used in a variety of medicinal ingredients, for 
instance to treat a variety of cancers. Taxus plants are difficult to 
distinguish from one another due to their similar morphology; indeed, some 
species of Taxus cytogenetic data still are unclear. Oligo-FISH can rapidly and 
efficiently provide insight into the genetic composition and karyotype. This is 
important for understanding the organization and evolution of chromosomes in 
Taxus species. We analysed five Taxus species using two oligonucleotide probes. 
(AG3T3)3 signals were distributed at the chromosome ends and the centromere of 
five species of Taxus. The 5S rDNA signal was displayed on two chromosomes of 
five species of Taxus. In addition to Taxus wallichiana var. mairei, 5S rDNA 
signals were found proximal in the remaining four species, which signals a 
difference in its location. The karyotype formula of Taxus wallichiana was 2n = 
2x = 24m, its karyotype asymmetry index was 55.56%, and its arm ratio was 
3.0087. Taxus × media's karyotype formula was 2n = 2x = 24m, its karyotype 
asymmetry index was 55.09%, and its arm ratio was 3.4198. The karyotype formula 
of Taxus yunnanensis was 2n = 2x = 24m, its karyotype asymmetry index was 
55.56%, and its arm ratio was 2.6402. The karyotype formula of Taxus cuspidate 
was 2n = 2x = 24m, its karyotype asymmetry index was 54.67%, its arm ratio was 
3.0135, and two chromosomes exhibited the 5S rDNA signal. The karyotype formula 
of T. wallichiana var. mairei was 2n= 2x = 22m + 2sm, its karyotype asymmetry 
index was 54.33%, and its arm ratio was 2.8716. Our results provide the 
karyotype analysis and physical genetic map of five species of Taxus, which 
contributes to providing molecular cytogenetics data for Taxus."
1945,"SLC26A4 is one of the most common genes causing autosomal recessive 
non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). It has been reported to cause 
Pendred Syndrome (PDS) and DFNB4 which is deafness with enlarged vestibular 
aqueduct (EVA). However, mutated SLC26A4 is not conclusive for having either 
DFNB4 or PDS. Three unrelated Jordanian families consisting of eight affected 
individuals with congenital bilateral hearing loss (HL) participated in this 
study. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing were performed to investigate the 
underlying molecular etiology of HL. Further clinical investigations, including 
laboratory blood workup for the thyroid gland, CT scan for the temporal bone, 
and thyroid ultrasound were performed. Three disease-causing variants were 
identified in SLC26A4 in the three families, two of which were novel. Two 
families had a novel pathogenic homozygous splice-site accepter variant 
(c.165-1G&gt;C), while the third family had compound heterozygous pathogenic 
variants (c.1446G&gt;A; p.Trp482* and c.304G&gt;A; p.Gly102Arg). Our approach 
helped in redirecting the diagnosis of several affected members of three 
different families from non-syndromic HL to syndromic HL. Two of the affected 
individuals had typical PDS, one had DFNB4, while the rest had atypical PDS. Our 
work emphasized the intra- and inter-familial variability of SLC26A4-related 
phenotypes. In addition, we highlighted the variable phenotypic impact of 
SLC26A4 on tailoring a personalized healthcare management."
1946,"Interspecific hybridization often shows negative effects on hybrids. However, 
only a few multicellular species, limited to a handful of plants and animals, 
have shown partial genetic mechanisms by which hybridization leads to low 
fitness in hybrids. Here, to explore the outcome of combining the two genomes of 
a horse and donkey, we analyzed the whole-genome sequences from an Equus 
parent-offspring trio using Illumina platforms. We generated 41.39× and 46.21× 
coverage sequences for the horse and mule, respectively. For the donkey, a 
40.38× coverage sequence was generated and stored in our laboratory. 
Approximately 24.86 million alleles were discovered that varied from the 
reference genome. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were used as polymorphic 
markers for assigning alleles to their parental genomic inheritance. We 
identified 25,703 Mendelian inheritance error single nucleotide polymorphisms in 
the mule genome that were not inherited from the parents through Mendelian 
inheritance. A total of 555 de novo single nucleotide polymorphisms were also 
identified. The rate of de novo single nucleotide polymorphisms was 2.21 × 10-7 
in the mule from the Equus parent-offspring trio. This rate is obviously higher 
than the natural mutation rate for Equus, which is also consistent with the 
previous hypothesis that interracial crosses may have a high mutation rate. The 
genes associated with these single nucleotide polymorphisms are mainly involved 
in immune processes, DNA repair, and cancer processes. The results of the 
analysis of three genomes from an Equus parent-offspring trio improved our 
knowledge of the consequences of the integration of parental genomes in mules."
1947,"White sponge nevus (WSN) is a rare autosomal dominant disease with a family 
history, often caused by mutations of the keratin 4 (K4) and keratin 13 (K13) 
genes in patients. It is characterized by frequently occurred white corrugated 
folds in the bilateral buccal mucosa with soft texture. On histopathological 
examination, hyperkeratosis of epithelial cells, edema, and vacuolar changes in 
the spinous cells are observed in the lesions, despite a normal layer of basal 
cells. WSN should be differentiated from other oral white spot diseases, mainly 
oral lichen planus, oral candidiasis, oral white edema, and Heck's disease, to 
reduce misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. At present, there is no specific 
treatment method. The purpose of this study was to report the clinical data of 
four WSN patients of the same family with the K4 gene mutation. The occurrence 
of WSN in a pair of monozygotic twins with very similar clinical presentations 
was identified for the first time. The gene sequencing results showed that there 
was a heterozygous deletion (C. 438_440delCAA) in exon 1 of the K4 gene, 
resulting in an aspartic acid loss in both the proband and his father. Finally, 
the etiology, pathogenesis, pathological manifestations, clinical 
manifestations, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and related treatment methods 
are discussed to provide a reference for clinical treatment of the disease."
1948,"Several studies have demonstrated that curcumin can cause the regression of 
polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), while others have shown negative 
results. Wholistic turmeric (WT) containing curcumin and additional bioactive 
compounds may contribute to this effect. We performed a double-blinded, 
randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of WT in FAP patients. Ten 
FAP patients were randomly assigned to receive either WT or placebo for 6 
months. Colonoscopies were performed at baseline and after 6 months. The polyp 
number and size, as well as the cumulative polyp burden, were assessed. No 
differences were noted between the groups in terms of changes from the 
baseline's polyp number, size, or burden. However, stratifying the data 
according to the right vs. left colon indicated a decrease in the median polyp 
number (from 5.5 to 1.5, p = 0.06) and polyp burden (from 24.25 mm to 11.5 mm, p 
= 0.028) in the left colon of the patients in the WT group. The adjusted left 
polyp number and burden in the WT arm were lower by 5.39 (p = 0.034) and 14.68 
mm (p = 0.059), respectively. Whether WT can be used to reduce the polyp burden 
of patients with predominantly left-sided polyps remains to be seen; thus, 
further larger prospective trials are required."
1949,"Homeostasis is achieved by balancing cell survival and death. In cancer cells, 
especially those carrying driver mutations, the processes and signals that 
promote apoptosis are inhibited, facilitating the survival and proliferation of 
these dysregulated cells. Apoptosis induction is an important mechanism 
underlying the therapeutic efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). However, the mechanisms by which EGFR-TKIs induce apoptosis have 
not been fully elucidated. A deeper understanding of the apoptotic pathways 
induced by EGFR-TKIs is essential for the developing novel strategies to 
overcome resistance to EGFR-TKIs or to enhance the initial efficacy through 
therapeutic synergistic combinations. Recently, therapeutic strategies targeting 
apoptosis have been developed for cancer. Here, we review the state of knowledge 
on EGFR-TKI-induced apoptotic pathways and discuss the therapeutic strategies 
for enhancing EGFR-TKI efficiency. We highlight the great progress achieved with 
third-generation EGFR-TKIs. In particular, combination therapies of EGFR-TKIs 
with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor/receptor inhibitors or chemotherapy 
have emerged as promising therapeutic strategies for patients with EGFR-mutated 
NSCLC. Nevertheless, further breakthroughs are needed to yield an appropriate 
standard care for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, which requires gaining a 
deeper understanding of cancer cell dynamics in response to EGFR-TKIs."
1950,"R-loops are DNA-RNA hybrids that play multifunctional roles in gene regulation, 
including replication, transcription, transcription-replication collision, 
epigenetics, and preserving the integrity of the genome. The aberrant formation 
and accumulation of unscheduled R-loops can disrupt gene expression and damage 
DNA, thereby causing genome instability. Recent links between unscheduled R-loop 
accumulation and the abundance of proteins that modulate R-loop biogenesis have 
been associated with numerous human diseases, including various cancers. 
Although R-loops are not necessarily causative for all disease entities 
described to date, they can perpetuate and even exacerbate the initially 
disease-eliciting pathophysiology, making them structures of interest for 
molecular diagnostics. In this review, we discuss the (patho) physiological role 
of R-loops in health and disease, their surprising diagnostic potential, and 
state-of-the-art techniques for their detection."
1951,"Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) has 
been shown in adults to minimize nerve palsy after thyroid surgery, but only few 
studies on its efficacy in a pediatric population have been reported. We 
conducted a retrospective study on patients operated for thyroid lesions from 
2016 to 2022. The analyzed population was divided in two groups: patients 
treated from 2016 to 2020, when the identification of the RLN was performed 
without IONM (Group A); and patients treated since 2021, when IONM was 
implemented in every surgical procedure on the thyroid (Group B). Intraoperative 
Neurophysiological Monitoring was performed by using corticobulbar motor-evoked 
potentials and continuous electromyography. Twentyfive children underwent 
thyroid resection, 19 (76%) of which due to thyroid carcinoma. Each patient's 
recurrent nerve was identified; IONM was used in 13 patients. In Group A, one 
temporary nerve palsy was identified postoperatively (8.3%), while in group B 
one nerve dysfunction occurred (7.7%). No statistically significant difference 
was found between the two groups in terms of post-operative RLN palsy. No 
surgical complication due to the use of IONM was reported. In children and 
teenagers, intraoperative neuromonitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is a 
safe and accurate method, minimizing the risk of nerve damage."
1952,"Primary enucleation is a life-saving treatment for advanced intraocular 
retinoblastoma, particularly in patients with poor visual potential and 
functional contralateral eyes. This single-center study presents the treatment 
outcomes of patients with unilateral retinoblastoma who received primary 
enucleation and adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, 
doxorubicin, and intrathecal methotrexate (CVDM) between 2000 and 2020. Twenty 
patients were enrolled in the study. The median age at diagnosis was 26 months 
(range, 1-45). Eighteen patients (90%) were in group E and two (10%) were in 
group D, according to the intraocular classification of retinoblastoma 
guidelines. Excluding one patient with an inadequate specimen, 19 patients (95%) 
had optic nerve involvement (ONI) at least up to the lamina cribrosa. Eight 
patients (40%) had choroidal invasion in addition to ONI. Two patients (10%) 
were surgical resection margin positive. The overall and event-free survival 
rates were 100% and 95%, respectively, for a median follow-up duration of 102.24 
months (range 24.2-202.9). There were no relapses or deaths due to any cause, 
but one patient developed secondary rhabdomyosarcoma 99.6 months after 
chemotherapy. Treatment was well tolerated, with minimal hematotoxicity and 
hepatotoxicity. CVDM as a post-enucleation chemotherapy for advanced intraocular 
retinoblastoma has excellent outcomes with tolerable toxicity. However, in line 
with updated treatment trends, further risk stratification and lowering the 
treatment intensity should be considered. Continued long-term follow-up is 
required to further determine late effects."
1953,"BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer is a ""stressful experience"" for parents in their 
role as caregivers. The aim of this study is to analyze the needs of a group of 
parents who have children diagnosed with cancer. The assessment looks at all 
areas of their daily life using a qualitative content analysis approach.
METHODS: This study uses open questions designed to investigate the main 
problems faced by the parents of children with cancer. All the answers were 
analyzed using MAXQDA 20 software. The study was conducted according to the 
Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ).
RESULTS: The content analysis of the answers from 13 mothers and 7 fathers is 
presented. The main themes as priority areas of need were: ""informal social 
support"", ""coping"", ""stressors/imbalances"" and ""health problems"". 
Dissatisfaction with the support provided from the informal network was 
detected. Although the participants expressed active coping, they also exhibited 
helplessness, as well as concerns regarding possible sequelae and the impact of 
this situation on the family's economic/work context. Conciliation problems were 
a source of stress. All this is consistent with the participants suffering from 
a variety of health issues.
CONCLUSIONS: the results show the effect of childhood cancer on different 
aspects of family life. They provide essential information for designing 
psychosocial interventions."
1954,"Pediatric patients with cancer experience significant distress from both 
treatment and cancer-related pain. Careful selection of an analgesic regimen 
should be based upon individual patient factors, including the level of pain, 
response to therapy, and physiologic profile. Refractory pain is a therapeutic 
dilemma frequently encountered in the pediatric cancer setting. Systemic 
lidocaine infusions have been described as both safe and efficacious, as prior 
studies show patients reporting decreased pain scores and improved quality of 
life after lidocaine treatment. Given the favorable side effect profile of 
lidocaine, it has the potential to be considered for analgesia in the setting of 
refractory pain. This review discusses the use of systemic lidocaine infusions 
for analgesia in pediatric oncology patients with cancer-related pain."
1955,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may present with a 
wide variety of symptoms, including neurological manifestations. We investigated 
clinical, demographic, laboratory, neurophysiological and imaging 
characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-positive children with seizures and analyzed 
differences between children admitted during the periods with prevalent 
circulation of the Alpha/Delta and Omicron variants, respectively. Patients' 
characteristics were analyzed according to the presence or absence of seizures 
and then according to the SARS-CoV-2 variants. Five-hundred and four 
SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were included: 93 (18.4%) with seizures and 411 
(81.6%) without. Patients with seizures were older, had more commonly an 
underlying epilepsy and had more frequently altered C-reactive protein than 
those without seizures. Electroencephalography was abnormal in 5/38 cases. 
According to the SARS-CoV-2 variant, seizures were recorded in 4.7% of the total 
number of hospitalized patients during the Alpha/Delta period, and in 16.9% of 
patients admitted during the Omicron period. During the Alpha/Delta variants, 
seizures were more commonly observed in patients with epilepsy compared to those 
observed during the Omicron period. Our findings suggest that although 
SARS-CoV-2 may potentially trigger seizures, they are generally not severe and 
do not require intensive care admission."
1956,"BACKGROUND: The sympathy-empathy (SE) system is commonly considered a key 
faculty implied in prosocial behaviors, and SE deficits (also called 
callous-unemotional traits, CUTs) are associated with nonprosocial and even 
violent behaviors. Thus, the first intuitive considerations considered a lack of 
SE among young people who undergo radicalization. Yet, their identification with 
a cause, their underlying feelings of injustice and grievance, and the other 
ways in which they may help communities, suggest that they may actually have a 
lot of empathy, even an excess of it. As a consequence, the links between SE and 
radicalization remain to be specified. This critical review aims to discuss 
whether and how SE is associated with developmental trajectories that lead young 
people to radicalization.
METHOD: We first recall the most recent findings about SE development, based on 
an interdisciplinary perspective informed by social neuroscience. Then, we 
review sociological and psychological studies that address radicalization. We 
will critically examine the intersections between SE and radicalization, 
including neuroscientific bases and anthropologic modulation of SE by social 
factors involved in radicalization.
RESULTS: This critical review indicates that the SE model should clearly 
distinguish between sympathy and empathy within the SE system. Using this model, 
we identified three possible trajectories in young radicalized individuals. In 
individuals with SE deficit, the legitimization of violence is enough to engage 
in radicalization. Concerning individuals with normal SE, we hypothesize two 
trajectories. First, based on SE inhibition/desensitization, individuals can 
temporarily join youths who lack empathy. Second, based on an SE dissociation, 
combining emotional sympathy increases for the in-group and cognitive empathy 
decreases toward the out-group.
CONCLUSIONS: While confirming that a lack of empathy can favor radicalization, 
the counterintuitive hypothesis of a favorable SE development trajectory also 
needs to be considered to better specify the cognitive and affective aspects of 
this complex phenomenon."
1957,"Severe acute behavioral and emotional problems represent one of the most serious 
treatment-related adverse effects for children and adolescents who have cancer. 
The critical and severe nature of these symptoms often makes necessary the use 
of psychotropic drugs. A working group composed of experts in multiple 
disciplines had the task of creating an agreement regarding a management plan 
for severe acute behavioral and emotional problems (SABEPs) in children and 
adolescents treated for cancer. To obtain global information on the use of 
psychotropic drugs in pediatric oncology, the working group first developed and 
mailed a 15-item questionnaire to many Italian pediatric oncology centers. 
Overall, an evident lack of knowledge and education regarding the use of 
psychotropic medications for the treatment of SABEPs was found. Thus, by 
referring to an adapted version of the Delphi method of consensus and standard 
methods for the elaboration of clinical questions (PICOs), the working group 
elaborated evidence-based recommendations for psychotropic drugs in the 
pediatric oncology setting. Furthermore, based on a thorough multivariate 
analysis of needs and difficulties, a comprehensive management flow was 
developed to optimize therapeutic interventions, which allows more accurate and 
efficient matching of the acute needs of patients while guiding treatment 
options."
1958,"INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune 
disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. SLE 
disproportionately affects women and minorities. Childhood-onset SLE (cSLE) in 
particular tends to be more aggressive than adult-onset SLE. Despite substantial 
improvements in the treatment of cSLE, there is significant variability in 
treatment responses and long-term outcomes. Furthermore, there is a paucity of 
studies involving cSLE, and in particular, cSLE among different age groups. The 
aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that an early-onset cSLE cohort 
would demonstrate unique characteristics with distinctive clinical and 
laboratory features at disease onset. We specifically investigated whether 
clinical, epidemiological, or serological factors are differentially associated 
with early- and late-onset cSLE. This could have direct impact on clinical 
management with the goal of improving outcomes and quality of life for children 
with SLE.
METHODS: Our study was conducted at a large tertiary center. We included 213 
subjects seen at our pediatric rheumatology clinic aged 4-17 years. 
Epidemiologic, clinical phenotype, disease severity, serology, treatment, and 
outcome data were compared between subjects with cSLE onset prior to 10 years of 
age (early-onset disease, n = 43) and those with cSLE onset greater than 10 
years of age (peri-adolescent disease, n = 170). We compared clinical features 
between early- and peri-adolescent onset cSLE in order to investigate the 
association between age at disease onset of cSLE and clinical disease expression 
and outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the 213 subjects with cSLE in our study, 43 subjects had early-onset 
disease (age 2 to ≤9 years) and 170 patients had peri-adolescent onset disease. 
We found that early-onset cSLE was associated with a higher prevalence of 
positive anti-dsDNA antibody at cSLE diagnosis, higher anti-dsDNA antibody titer 
at cSLE diagnosis, rash, and azathioprine use (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.004, p = 
0.011, and p = 0.008, respectively). In contrast, we found that peri-adolescent 
onset cSLE (≥10 years of age) was associated with worse disease activity (SLEDAI 
range 0-24) (p &lt; 0.001), higher SLICC at diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001), as well as 
a higher rate of mycophenolate mofetil and hydroxychloroquine use (p = 0.003 and 
p &lt; 0.001, respectively). There were no significant differences in the 
prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms or the development of Class IV/Class V 
lupus nephritis between the early-onset and peri-adolescent groups."
1959,"INTRODUCTION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer; 
the level of HPV-related knowledge among young students remains however 
questionable. The purpose of the present study was to investigate knowledge 
pertaining to HPV, cervical cancer screening, and vaccination among students in 
the Nursing Department and Department of Social Work of the Hellenic 
Mediterranean University of Crete, Greece.
METHODS: This was a questionnaire-based, cross-sectional study involving 371 
first-year and third-year students of the two Departments. Multivariate linear 
and logistic regression analysis was performed to examine factors associated 
with knowledge related to HPV, cervical cancer screening, and HPV vaccination.
RESULTS: Only 22.1% of students knew all the ways of HPV transmission and only 
5.9% knew the whole spectrum of cancers that HPV could cause. The vaccination 
rate for HPV was 33.7%. The majority of students used the Internet as the main 
source of information (62.3%). Students' sociodemographic characteristics, 
including age, marital status, and Department of studies were associated with 
knowledge about HPV.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights knowledge gaps and indicates the need 
for thorough health education strategies on HPV, targeting families and young 
people."
1960,"The incidence of anal cancer is rising worldwide. As identified in cervical 
cancer management, an improvement in the early detection and management of anal 
pre-cancer is essential. In other cancers associated with human papillomavirus 
(HPV), HPV 16 sub-lineages have been shown to be associated with disease status 
and prognosis. However, in anal cancer, they have been under-explored. A total 
of 119 HPV 16-positive anal cancer lesions diagnosed between 2009 and 2018 in 
Scotland and 134 HPV 16-positive residual rectal swabs from asymptomatic men 
collected in 2016/7 were whole genome sequenced. The association of HPV 16 
sub-lineages with underlying disease status (cancer vs. asymptomatic) and 
overall survival in anal cancer samples was assessed (comparing A1 vs non-A1 
sub-lineages). A1 was the dominant sub-lineage present in the anal cancer 
(76.5%) and the asymptomatic (76.1%) cohorts. A2 was the second most dominant 
sub-lineage in both groups (16.8% and 17.2%, respectively). We did not observe 
significant associations of sub-lineage with demographics, clinical variables or 
survival (A1 vs. non-A1 sub-lineages (HR 0.83, 0.28-2.46 p = 0.743)). HPV 16 
sub-lineages do to not appear to cluster with disease vs asymptomatic carriage 
or be independently associated with outcomes in anal cancer patients. Further 
international studies on anal HPV sub-lineage mapping will help to determine 
whether this is a consistent observation."
1961,"Minimally invasive treatment of uterine fibroids usually requires a power 
morcellation, which could be associated with several complications. A rare 
sequela is disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis. Indeed, recurrence or 
metastasis in these cases could be attributed to iatrogenic or under-evaluation 
of primary tumors, although a subset of cases is a sporadic sample of biological 
progression. We present an extremely rare case of a patient who underwent 
laparoscopic morcellation and after 12 years developed a pelvic leiomyosarcoma 
with two omental metastases, disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis with a 
parasite leiomyoma with bizarre nuclei and a parasite cellular leiomyoma 
simultaneously. The diagnosis was predicted preoperatively by an expert 
sonographer who recognized the ultrasound characteristics of uterine sarcoma and 
the localization of some of the masses, so the patient was referred to the 
gynaecological oncologists who could appropriately treat her. We present here a 
case report and a systematic review that could be a useful tool for further 
discussion and future clinical practice guidelines."
1962,"Image fusion of CT, MRI, and PET with endoscopic ultrasound and transabdominal 
ultrasound can be promising for GI malignancies as it has the potential to allow 
for a more precise lesion characterization with higher accuracy in tumor 
detection, staging, and interventional/image guidance. We conducted a literature 
review to identify the current possibilities of real-time image fusion involving 
US with a focus on clinical applications in the management of GI malignancies. 
Liver applications have been the most extensively investigated, either in 
experimental or commercially available systems. Real-time US fusion imaging of 
the liver is gaining more acceptance as it enables further diagnosis and 
interventional therapy of focal liver lesions that are difficult to visualize 
using conventional B-mode ultrasound. Clinical studies on EUS guided image 
fusion, to date, are limited. EUS-CT image fusion allowed for easier navigation 
and profiling of the target tumor and/or surrounding anatomical structure. Image 
fusion techniques encompassing multiple imaging modalities appear to be feasible 
and have been observed to increase visualization accuracy during interventional 
and diagnostic applications."
1963,"Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (LncRNAs) are recently known for their role in 
regulating gene expression and the development of cancer. Controversial results 
indicate a correlation between the tissue expression of LncRNA and LncRNA 
content of extracellular vesicles. The present study aimed to evaluate the 
expression of different LncRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients 
in tumor tissue, adjacent non-cancerous tissue (ANCT), and exosome-mediated 
lncRNA. Tumor and ANCT, as well as serum samples of 168 patient with NSCLC, were 
collected. The GHSROS, HNF1A-AS1, HOTAIR, HMlincRNA717, and LINCRNA-p21 relative 
expressions in tumor tissue, ANCT, and serum exosomes were evaluated in NSCLC 
patients. Among 168 NSCLC samples, the expressions of GHSROS (REx = 3.64, p = 
0.028), HNF1A-AS1 (REx = 2.97, p = 0.041), and HOTAIR (REx = 2.9, p = 0.0389) 
were upregulated, and the expressions of HMlincRNA717 (REx = -4.56, p = 0.0012) 
and LINCRNA-p21 (REx = -5.14, p = 0.00334) were downregulated in tumor tissue in 
contrast to ANCT. Moreover, similar statistical differences were seen in the 
exosome-derived RNA of tumor tissues in contrast to ANCT samples. A panel of the 
five lncRNAs demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) for exosome and 
tumor was 0.937 (standard error: 0.012, p value &lt; 0.0001). LncRNAs GHSROS, 
HNF1A-AS1, and HOTAIR showed high expression in tumor tissue and exosome content 
in NSCLC, and a panel that consisted of all five lncRNAs improved diagnosis of 
NSCLC."
1964,"(1) Background: Early-stage glottic cancer is easily missed on magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) may improve diagnostic 
accuracy. Therefore, our aim was to assess the value of adding 
diffusion-weighted imaging with background body signal suppression (DWIBS) to 
pre-therapeutic MRI staging. (2) Methods: Two radiologists with 8 and 13 years 
of experience, blinded to each other's findings, initially interpreted only 
standard MRI, later DWIBS alone, and afterward, standard MRI + DWIBS in 41 
patients with histopathologically proven pT1a laryngeal cancer of the glottis. 
(3) Results: Detectability rates with standard MRI, DWIBS only, and standard MRI 
+ DWIBS were 68-71%, 63-66%, and 73-76%, respectively. Moreover, interobserver 
reliability was calculated as good (κ = 0.712), very good (κ = 0.84), and good 
(κ = 0.69) for standard MRI, DWIBS only, and standard MRI + DWIBS, respectively. 
(4) Conclusions: Standard MRI, DWIBS alone, and standard MRI + DWIBS showed an 
encouraging detection rate, as well as distinct interobserver reliability in the 
diagnosis of early-stage laryngeal cancer when compared to the definitive 
histopathologic report."
1965,"Since excessive alcohol consumption is a shared risk factor for esophageal 
cancer and liver fibrosis, it is possible that patients with esophageal cancer 
may develop unknown liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. We applied preoperative 
transient elastography (TE) to patients without recorded cirrhosis undergoing 
esophagectomy to clarify the validity in predicting postesophagectomy hepatic 
failure. The cohort consisted of 107 patients who received TE before 
esophagectomy between June 2018 and December 2021. Patients were categorized 
into two groups based on the fibrosis score yielded by preoperative TE (mild 
group: 0~2, n = 92; severe group: 3~4, n = 15). There was no significant 
difference in demographic data nor surgical variables between the two groups. 
None of the cohort encountered hepatic failure, yet the severe fibrosis group 
had a significantly higher rate of pleural effusion (40.0% versus 15.2%, p = 
0.03). The areas under the curve (AUCs) of TE in predicting postoperative 
complications and 180-day mortality were 0.60 (95% CI: 0.46-0.74) and 0.67 (95% 
CI: 0.51-0.83), respectively. In conclusion, stratification of patients with 
esophageal cancer who had liver fibrosis by preoperative TE demonstrates 
significant validity in predicting postoperative pleural effusions. Recruitment 
of noncirrhotic patients with higher TE scores is warranted to examine its power 
in other parameters."
1966,"As the currently available tests for the clinical management of prostate cancer 
(PCa) are still far from providing precise diagnosis and risk stratification, 
the identification of new molecular marker(s) remains a pertinent clinical need. 
Candidate PCa biomarkers from the published proteomic comparative studies of 
prostate tissue (2002-2020) were collected and systematically evaluated. AZGP1, 
MDH2, FABP5, ENO1, GSTP1, GSTM2, and EZR were chosen for further evaluation in 
the urine of 85 PCa patients and controls using ELISA. Statistically significant 
differences in protein levels between PCa and BPH showed FABP5 (p = 0.019) and 
ENO1 (p = 0.015). A biomarker panel based on the combination of FABP5, ENO1, and 
PSA provided the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.795) for PCa detection. The 
combination of FABP5, EZR, AZGP1, and MDH2 showed AUC = 0.889 in PCa prognosis, 
with 85.29% of the samples correctly classified into low and high Gleason score 
(GS) groups. The addition of PSA to the panel slightly increased the AUC to 
0.914. AZGP1, FABP5, and EZR showed significant correlation with GS, stage, and 
percentage of positive biopsy cores. Although validation using larger patient 
cohorts will be necessary to establish the credibility of the proposed biomarker 
panels in a clinical context, this study opens a way for the further testing of 
more high-quality proteomics biomarkers, which could ultimately add value to the 
clinical management of PCa."
1967,"Gynecologic cancers are the leading cause of death in women. Endometrial, 
ovarian, and cervical cancer are the three main types of gynecologic cancers. 
Poor prognoses and high mortality rates of advanced-stage cancer are still 
challenges of all three types. Diagnostic tools for early cancer detection could 
be the cornerstone for further cancer treatment and prevention. Glycosylation 
plays a vital role in cell proliferation, adhesion, motility, and angiogenesis, 
and is aberrantly expressed in cancer cells. Alterations of glycosylation may 
represent promising biomarkers with potential diagnostic and monitoring 
applications, as well as disease prognosis. Many glycosylated biomarkers, 
including glycoprotein, glycan, and enzyme, were discovered and well-studied for 
application in gynecologic cancers. Some of them have been developed as targets 
for cancer treatment. The use of certain biomarkers for diagnostics and 
monitoring of gynecologic cancers has clinical advantages, as it is 
quantitative, comparable, convenient, and inexpensive. However, one of the 
single markers have sufficient sensitivity for the screening of gynecologic 
cancers. In this review, we introduced the details of glycosylation and the 
current application of glycosylated biomarkers in these three cancers. Moreover, 
we also reviewed the different roles of each biomarker in other cancers and 
aimed to understand these glycosylated biomarkers comprehensively."
1968,"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of recurrent prostate cancer is a cornerstone for 
further adequate therapy planning. Therefore, clinical practice and research 
still focuses on diagnostic tools that can detect prostate cancer in early 
recurrence when it is undetectable in conventional diagnostic imaging. 
18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT is a novel method to evaluate patients with biochemical 
recurrent PCa. The aim of this review was to evaluate the role of 18F-PSMA-1007 
PET/CT in prostate cancer local recurrence, lymph node metastases and bone 
metastases detection.
METHODS: Original studies, reviews and five meta-analyses were included in this 
article. A total of 70 studies were retrieved, 31 were included in the study.
RESULTS: All patients described in the studies underwent 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT. 
The administered 18F-PSMA-1007 individual dose ranged from 159 ± 31 MBq to 
363.93 ± 69.40 MBq. Results showed that 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT demonstrates a good 
detection rate in recurrent prostate cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT appears to achieve reliable performance in 
detecting recurrent prostate cancer. The high detection rate of 18F-PSMA-1007 
PET/CT in recurrent prostate cancer was confirmed, especially in local 
recurrence and small lymph nodes with non-specific characteristics on 
conventional diagnostic imaging methods. However, several authors emphasize some 
limitations for this tracer-for example, non-specific uptake in bone lesions 
that can mimic bone metastases."
1969,"Background: Management of patients with radioiodine (RAI)-refractory 
differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is a challenge as I-131 therapy is deemed 
ineffective while standard-of-care systemic therapy with tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (TKI) lenvatinib is associated with frequent toxicities leading to 
dose reductions and withdrawal. A potential new treatment approach is to use 
TKIs as redifferentiation agent to restore RAI uptake to an extent that I-131 
therapy is warranted. Prior studies show that short-term treatment with other 
TKIs restores RAI uptake in 50-60% of radioiodine-refractory DTC patients, but 
this concept has not been investigated for lenvatinib. Furthermore, the optimal 
duration of treatment with TKIs for maximal redifferentiation has not been 
explored. Methods and Design: A total of 12 patients with RAI-refractory DTC 
with an indication for lenvatinib will undergo I-124 PET/CT to quantify RAI 
uptake. This process is repeated after 6 and 12 weeks post-initiating lenvatinib 
after which the prospective dose estimate to target lesions and organs at risk 
will be determined. Patients will subsequently stop lenvatinib and undergo I-131 
treatment if it is deemed effective and safe by predefined norms. The I-124 
PET/CT measurements after 6 and 12 weeks of the first six patients are compared 
and the optimal timepoint will be determined for the remaining patients. In all 
I-131 treated patients post-therapy SPECT/CT dosimetry verification will be 
performed. During follow-up, clinical response will be evaluated using serum 
thyroglobulin levels and F-18 FDG PET/CT imaging for 6 months. It is 
hypothesized that at least 40% of patients will show meaningful renewed RAI 
uptake after short-term lenvatinib treatment. Discussion: Shorter treatment 
duration of lenvatinib treatment is preferred because of frequent 
toxicity-related dose reductions and drug withdrawals in long-term lenvatinib 
treatment. Short-term treatment with lenvatinib with subsequent I-131 therapy 
poses a potential new management approach for these patients. Since treatment 
duration is reduced and I-131 therapy is more tolerable for most patients, this 
potentially leads to less toxicity and higher quality of life. Identifying 
RAI-refractory DTC patients who redifferentiate after lenvatinib therapy is 
therefore crucial. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NTC04858867."
1970,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually being utilized in various fields as 
its performance has been improving with the development of deep learning 
methods, availability of big data, and the progression of computer processing 
units. In the field of medicine, AI is mainly implemented in image recognition, 
such as in radiographic and pathologic diagnoses. In the realm of 
gastrointestinal endoscopy, although AI-based computer-assisted 
detection/diagnosis (CAD) systems have been applied in some areas, such as 
colorectal polyp detection and diagnosis, so far, their implementation in 
real-world clinical settings is limited. The accurate detection or diagnosis of 
gastric cancer (GC) is one of the challenges in which performance varies greatly 
depending on the endoscopist's skill. The diagnosis of early GC is especially 
challenging, partly because early GC mimics atrophic gastritis in the background 
mucosa. Therefore, several CAD systems for GC are being actively developed. The 
development of a CAD system for GC is considered challenging because it requires 
a large number of GC images. In particular, early stage GC images are rarely 
available, partly because it is difficult to diagnose gastric cancer during the 
early stages. Additionally, the training image data should be of a sufficiently 
high quality to conduct proper CAD training. Recently, several AI systems for GC 
that exhibit a robust performance, owing to being trained on a large number of 
high-quality images, have been reported. This review outlines the current status 
and prospects of AI use in esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS), focusing on the 
diagnosis of GC."
1971,"(1) Background: Microwave breast imaging (MBI) is a promising breast-imaging 
technology that uses harmless electromagnetic waves to radiate the breast and 
assess its internal structure. It utilizes the difference in dielectric 
properties of healthy and cancerous tissue, as well as the dielectric difference 
between different cancerous tissue types to identify anomalies inside the breast 
and make further clinical predictions. In this study, we evaluate the capability 
of our upgraded MBI device to provide breast tissue pathology. (2) Methods: Only 
patients who were due to undergo biopsy were included in the study. A machine 
learning (ML) approach, namely Gradient Boosting, was used to understand 
information from the frequency spectrum, collected via SAFE, and provide breast 
tissue pathology. (3) Results: A total of 54 patients were involved in the 
study: 29 of them had benign and 25 had malignant findings. SAFE acquired 20 
true-positive, 24 true-negative, 4 false-positive and 4 false-negative findings, 
achieving the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 80%, 83% and 81%, 
respectively. (4) Conclusions: The use of harmless tissue radiation indicates 
that SAFE can be used to provide the breast pathology of women of any age 
without safety restrictions. Results indicate that SAFE is capable of providing 
breast pathology at a high rate, encouraging further clinical investigations."
1972,"Pilomatrix-like high-grade endometrioid carcinoma (PiMHEC) has recently been 
described as an aggressive variant of endometrial carcinoma. Herein, we 
described a case of ovarian PiMHEC, comparing it to endometrial PiMHEC and 
assessing previously published cases of putative ovarian PiMHEC. A 65-year-old 
woman underwent hysterectomy for an ovarian tumor characterized by solid nests 
of basaloid cells with prominent ghost cell keratinization. Immunohistochemistry 
showed nuclear β-catenin and CDX2 expression and loss of estrogen and 
progesterone receptors and PAX8. These features were consistently observed in 
all previously published cases and may represent diagnostic criteria of PiMHEC. 
Other frequent features were geographic necrosis and a low-grade endometrioid 
component. CK7, neuroendocrine, and basal/squamous markers were inconsistently 
expressed. All cases with available follow-up showed poor prognosis. PiMHEC 
should be distinguished from mimickers, such as high-grade endometrioid 
carcinoma with geographic necrosis, low-grade endometrioid carcinoma with ghost 
cell keratinization, and undifferentiated/dedifferentiated carcinoma. In 
conclusion, PiMHEC can also occur in the ovary and shows several consistent 
clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypical features. These features support 
that PiMHEC is a distinct entity requiring an aggressive management."
1973,"Skin cancer is one of the most severe forms of the disease, and it can spread to 
other parts of the body if not detected early. Therefore, diagnosing and 
treating skin cancer patients at an early stage is crucial. Since a manual skin 
cancer diagnosis is both time-consuming and expensive, an incorrect diagnosis is 
made due to the high similarity between the various skin cancers. Improved 
categorization of multiclass skin cancers requires the development of automated 
diagnostic systems. Herein, we propose a fully automatic method for classifying 
several skin cancers by fine-tuning the deep learning models VGG16, ResNet50, 
and ResNet101. Prior to model creation, the training dataset should undergo data 
augmentation using traditional image transformation techniques and Generative 
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to prevent class imbalance issues that may lead to 
model overfitting. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of creating 
dermoscopic images that have a realistic appearance using Conditional Generative 
Adversarial Network (CGAN) techniques. Thereafter, the traditional augmentation 
methods are used to augment our existing training set to improve the performance 
of pre-trained deep models on the skin cancer classification task. This improved 
performance is then compared to the models developed using the unbalanced 
dataset. In addition, we formed an ensemble of finely tuned transfer learning 
models, which we trained on balanced and unbalanced datasets. These models were 
used to make predictions about the data. With appropriate data augmentation, the 
proposed models attained an accuracy of 92% for VGG16, 92% for ResNet50, and 
92.25% for ResNet101, respectively. The ensemble of these models increased the 
accuracy to 93.5%. A comprehensive discussion on the performance of the models 
concluded that using this method possibly leads to enhanced performance in skin 
cancer categorization compared to the efforts made in the past."
1974,"Purpose: Shear-wave elastography (SWE) measures tissue elasticity using 
ultrasound waves. This study proposes a histogram-based SWE analysis to improve 
breast malignancy detection. Methods: N = 22/32 (patients/tumors) benign and n = 
51/64 malignant breast tumors with histological ground truth. Colored SWE 
heatmaps were adjusted to a 0-180 kPa scale. Normalized, 250-binned RGB 
histograms were used as image descriptors based on skewness and area under curve 
(AUC). The histogram method was compared to conventional SWE metrics, such as 
(1) the qualitative 5-point scale classification and (2) average stiffness 
(SWEavg)/maximal tumor stiffness (SWEmax) within the tumor B-mode boundaries. 
Results: The SWEavg and SWEmax did not discriminate malignant lesions in this 
database, p &gt; 0.05, rank sum test. RGB histograms, however, differed between 
malignant and benign tumors, p &lt; 0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test. The AUC 
analysis of histograms revealed the reduction of soft-tissue components as a 
significant SWE biomarker (p = 0.03, rank sum). The diagnostic accuracy of the 
suggested method is still low (Se = 0.30 for Se = 0.90) and a subject for 
improvement in future studies. Conclusions: Histogram-based SWE quantitation 
improved the diagnostic accuracy for malignancy compared to conventional average 
SWE metrics. The sensitivity is a subject for improvement in future studies."
1975,"Thyroid carcinomas (TC) are rare in the pediatric population; however, they 
constitute the most common endocrine malignancy. Despite some similarities with 
adult carcinomas, they have distinct clinical behavior and responses to therapy 
due to their unique pathology and molecular characteristics. The age cut-off 
used for defining the pediatric age group has been variable across different 
studies, and the universally accepted recommendations influence accurate 
interpretation of the available data. Moreover, factors such as radiation 
exposure and germline mutations have greater impact in children than in adults. 
Papillary TC is the most common and the most evaluated pediatric TC. Others, 
including follicular, poorly differentiated and medullary carcinomas, are rarer 
and have limited available literature. Most studies are from the West. Asian 
studies are primarily from Japan, with few from China, India, Saudi Arabia and 
Republic of Korea. This review provides a comprehensive account of the 
well-established and novel biomarkers in the field, including point mutations, 
fusions, miRNA, and thyroid differentiation genes. Familial and syndromic 
associations are also discussed. Current management guidelines for pediatric 
patients are largely derived from those for adults. An awareness of the 
molecular landscape is essential to acknowledge the uniqueness of these tumors 
and establish specific diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines."
1976,"In computer-aided diagnosis methods for breast cancer, deep learning has been 
shown to be an effective method to distinguish whether lesions are present in 
tissues. However, traditional methods only classify masses as benign or 
malignant, according to their presence or absence, without considering the 
contextual features between them and their adjacent tissues. Furthermore, for 
contrast-enhanced spectral mammography, the existing studies have only performed 
feature extraction on a single image per breast. In this paper, we propose a 
multi-input deep learning network for automatic breast cancer classification. 
Specifically, we simultaneously input four images of each breast with different 
feature information into the network. Then, we processed the feature maps in 
both horizontal and vertical directions, preserving the pixel-level contextual 
information within the neighborhood of the tumor during the pooling operation. 
Furthermore, we designed a novel loss function according to the information 
bottleneck theory to optimize our multi-input network and ensure that the common 
information in the multiple input images could be fully utilized. Our 
experiments on 488 images (256 benign and 232 malignant images) from 122 
patients show that the method's accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, 
and f1-score values are 0.8806, 0.8803, 0.8810, 0.8801, and 0.8806, 
respectively. The qualitative, quantitative, and ablation experiment results 
show that our method significantly improves the accuracy of breast cancer 
classification and reduces the false positive rate of diagnosis. It can reduce 
misdiagnosis rates and unnecessary biopsies, helping doctors determine accurate 
clinical diagnoses of breast cancer from multiple CESM images."
1977,"Serous ovarian cancer is the most common type of ovarian epithelial cancer and 
usually has a poor prognosis. The objective of this study was to construct an 
individualized prognostic model for predicting overall survival in serous 
ovarian cancer. Based on the relative expression orderings (Ea &gt; Eb/Ea ≤ Eb) 
of gene pairs closely associated with serous ovarian prognosis, we tried 
constructing a potential individualized qualitative biomarker by the greedy 
algorithm and evaluated the performance in independent validation datasets. We 
constructed a prognostic biomarker consisting of 20 gene pairs (SOV-P20). The 
overall survival between high- and low-risk groups stratified by SOV-P20 was 
statistically significantly different in the training and independent validation 
datasets from other platforms (p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon test). The average area 
under the curve (AUC) values of the training and three validation datasets were 
0.756, 0.590, 0.630, and 0.680, respectively. The distribution of most immune 
cells between high- and low-risk groups was quite different (p &lt; 0.001, 
Wilcoxon test). The low-risk patients tended to show significantly better tumor 
response to chemotherapy than the high-risk patients (p &lt; 0.05, Fisher's 
exact test). SOV-P20 achieved the highest mean index of concordance (C-index) 
(0.624) compared with the other seven existing prognostic signatures (ranging 
from 0.511 to 0.619). SOV-P20 is a promising prognostic biomarker for serous 
ovarian cancer, which will be applicable for clinical predictive risk 
assessment."
1978,"Predicting factors of diagnostic yield in electromagnetic navigation 
bronchoscopy (ENB) have been explored in a number of previous studies based on 
data from experienced operators. However, little is known about predicting 
factors when the procedure is carried out by operators in the beginning of their 
learning curve. We here aim to identify the role of operators' experience as 
well as lesion- and procedure characteristics on diagnostic yield of ENB 
procedures in the hands of novice ENB operators. Four operators from three 
centers without prior ENB experience were enrolled. The outcome of consecutive 
ENB procedures was assessed and classified as either diagnostic or 
non-diagnostic and predicting factors of diagnostic yield were assessed. A total 
of 215 procedures were assessed. A total of 122 (57%) of the ENB procedures 
resulted in diagnostic biopsies. Diagnostic ENB procedures were associated with 
a minor yet significant difference in tumor size compared to 
non-diagnostic/inconclusive ENB procedures (28 mm vs. 24 mm; p = 0.03). 
Diagnostic ENB procedures were associated with visible lesions at either 
fluoroscopy (p = 0.003) or radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS), (p = 0.001). 
In the logistic regression model, lesion visibility on fluoroscopy, but none of 
operator experience, the presence of a bronchus sign, lesion size, or location 
nor visibility on rEBUS significantly impacted the diagnostic yield. In novice 
ENB operators, lesion visibility on fluoroscopy was the only factor found to 
increase the chance of obtaining a diagnostic sample."
1979,"Cervical cancer is the most common cancer and ranked as 4th in morbidity and 
mortality among Malaysian women. Currently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is 
considered as the gold standard imaging modality for tumours with a stage higher 
than IB2, due to its superiority in diagnostic assessment of tumour infiltration 
with excellent soft-tissue contrast. In this research, the robustness of 
semi-automatic segmentation has been evaluated using a flood-fill algorithm for 
quantitative feature extraction, using 30 diffusion weighted MRI images 
(DWI-MRI) of cervical cancer patients. The relevant features were extracted from 
DWI-MRI segmented images of cervical cancer. First order statistics, shape 
features, and textural features were extracted and analysed. The intra-class 
relation coefficient (ICC) was used to compare 662 radiomic features extracted 
from manual and semi-automatic segmentations. Notably, the features extracted 
from the semi-automatic segmentation and flood filling algorithm (average ICC = 
0.952 0.009, p &gt; 0.05) were significantly higher than the manual extracted 
features (average ICC = 0.897 0.011, p &gt; 0.05). Henceforth, we demonstrate 
that the semi-automatic segmentation is slightly expanded to manual segmentation 
as it produces more robust and reproducible radiomic features."
1980,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided tissue acquisition (EUS-TA) is less accurate 
in obtaining samples from gastrointestinal subepithelial lesions (SELs) ≤2 cm 
than from pancreatic cancers. The present study compared the usefulness of 22G 
Fork-tip and Franseen needles for EUS-TA and assessed the ability of 
contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS (CH-EUS) to diagnose SELs ≤2 cm. Fifty-seven 
patients who underwent EUS-TA for SELs ≤2 cm were evaluated. The primary 
endpoint was to compare the rate of acquisition of sufficient samples by these 
two needles. Secondary endpoints included technical success rate, adverse 
events, numbers of needle passes, and diagnostic ability of CH-EUS for SELs. Of 
the 57 included patients, 23 and 34 underwent EUS-TA with Fork-tip and Franseen 
needles, respectively. Technical success rates were 100% with both needles and 
adverse events occurred in zero (0%) and one (2.9%) patient with Fork-tip and 
Franseen needles, respectively. The rate of adequate sample acquisition was 
significantly higher using Fork-tip than Franseen needles (96% vs. 74%; p = 
0.038). The hyper- or iso-vascular pattern on CH-EUS correlated significantly 
with a diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (p &lt; 0.001). EUS-TA with 
Fork-tip needles were superior to EUS-TA with Franseen needles in acquiring 
sufficient samples and CH-EUS was also useful for the diagnosis of SELs ≤2 cm."
1981,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors including hypertension, 
hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and abdominal obesity. Metabolism-related risk 
factors include diabetes and heart disease. MetS is also linked to numerous 
cancers and chronic kidney disease. All of these variables raise medical costs. 
Developing a prediction model that can quickly identify persons at high risk of 
MetS and offer them a treatment plan is crucial. Early prediction of metabolic 
syndrome will highly impact the quality of life of patients as it gives them a 
chance for making a change to the bad habit and preventing a serious illness in 
the future. In this paper, we aimed to assess the performance of various 
algorithms of machine learning in order to decrease the cost of predictive 
diagnoses of metabolic syndrome. We employed ten machine learning algorithms 
along with different metaheuristics for feature selection. Moreover, we examined 
the effects of data augmentation in the prediction accuracy. The statistics show 
that the augmentation of data after applying feature selection on the data 
highly improves the performance of the classifiers."
1982,"This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the pix2pix generative adversarial 
network (GAN) to improve the image quality of low-count dedicated breast 
positron emission tomography (dbPET). Pairs of full- and low-count dbPET images 
were collected from 49 breasts. An image synthesis model was constructed using 
pix2pix GAN for each acquisition time with training (3776 pairs from 16 breasts) 
and validation data (1652 pairs from 7 breasts). Test data included dbPET images 
synthesized by our model from 26 breasts with short acquisition times. Two 
breast radiologists visually compared the overall image quality of the original 
and synthesized images derived from the short-acquisition time data (scores of 
1-5). Further quantitative evaluation was performed using a peak signal-to-noise 
ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM). In the visual evaluation, both 
readers revealed an average score of &gt;3 for all images. The quantitative 
evaluation revealed significantly higher SSIM (p &lt; 0.01) and PSNR (p &lt; 
0.01) for 26 s synthetic images and higher PSNR for 52 s images (p &lt; 0.01) 
than for the original images. Our model improved the quality of low-count time 
dbPET synthetic images, with a more significant effect on images with lower 
counts."
1983,"Artificial intelligence (AI), a rousing advancement disrupting a wide spectrum 
of applications with remarkable betterment, has continued to gain momentum over 
the past decades. Within breast imaging, AI, especially machine learning and 
deep learning, honed with unlimited cross-data/case referencing, has found great 
utility encompassing four facets: screening and detection, diagnosis, disease 
monitoring, and data management as a whole. Over the years, breast cancer has 
been the apex of the cancer cumulative risk ranking for women across the six 
continents, existing in variegated forms and offering a complicated context in 
medical decisions. Realizing the ever-increasing demand for quality healthcare, 
contemporary AI has been envisioned to make great strides in clinical data 
management and perception, with the capability to detect indeterminate 
significance, predict prognostication, and correlate available data into a 
meaningful clinical endpoint. Here, the authors captured the review works over 
the past decades, focusing on AI in breast imaging, and systematized the 
included works into one usable document, which is termed an umbrella review. The 
present study aims to provide a panoramic view of how AI is poised to enhance 
breast imaging procedures. Evidence-based scientometric analysis was performed 
in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, resulting in 71 included review works. This 
study aims to synthesize, collate, and correlate the included review works, 
thereby identifying the patterns, trends, quality, and types of the included 
works, captured by the structured search strategy. The present study is intended 
to serve as a ""one-stop center"" synthesis and provide a holistic bird's eye view 
to readers, ranging from newcomers to existing researchers and relevant 
stakeholders, on the topic of interest."
1984,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare disease of the lung with a largely 
unknown etiology and a poor prognosis. Intriguingly, forms of familial pulmonary 
fibrosis (FPF) have long been known and linked to specific genetic mutations. 
There is little evidence of the possible role of genetics in the etiology of 
sporadic IPF. We carried out a non-systematic, narrative literature review aimed 
at describing the main known genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that are involved 
in the pathogenesis and prognosis of IPF and FPF. In this review, we highlighted 
the mutations in classical genes associated with FPF, including those encoding 
for telomerases (TERT, TERC, PARN, RTEL1), which are also found in about 10-20% 
of cases of sporadic IPF. In addition to the Mendelian forms, mutations in the 
genes encoding for the surfactant proteins (SFTPC, SFTPA1, SFTPA2, ABCA3) and 
polymorphisms of genes for the mucin MUC5B and the Toll-interacting protein 
TOLLIP are other pathways favoring the fibrogenesis that have been thoroughly 
explored. Moreover, great attention has been paid to the main epigenetic 
alterations (DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA gene 
silencing) that are emerging to play a role in fibrogenesis. Finally, a gaze on 
the shared mechanisms between cancer and fibrogenesis, and future perspectives 
on the genetics of pulmonary fibrosis have been analyzed."
1985,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, after lung 
cancer. However, early detection of breast cancer can help to reduce death rates 
in breast cancer patients and also prevent cancer from spreading to other parts 
of the body. This work proposes a new method to design a bio-marker integrating 
Bayesian predictive models, pyRadiomics System and genetic algorithms to 
classify the benign and malignant lesions. The method allows one to evaluate two 
types of images: The radiologist-segmented lesion, and a novel automated breast 
cancer detection by the analysis of the whole breast. The results demonstrate 
only a difference of 12% of effectiveness for the cases of calcification between 
the radiologist generated segmentation and the automatic whole breast analysis, 
and a 25% of difference between the lesion and the breast for the cases of 
masses. In addition, our approach was compared against other proposed methods in 
the literature, providing an AUC = 0.86 for the analysis of images with lesions 
in breast calcification, and AUC = 0.96 for masses."
1986,"OBJECTIVES: Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia 
(DIPNECH) occurs due to abnormal proliferation of pulmonary neuroendocrine 
cells. We hypothesized that performing a quantitative analysis of airway 
features on chest CT may reveal differences to matched controls, which could 
ultimately help provide an imaging biomarker.
METHODS: A retrospective quantitative analysis of chest CTs in patients with 
DIPNECH and age matched controls was carried out using semi-automated 
post-processing software. Paired segmental airway and artery diameters were 
measured for each bronchopulmonary segment, and the airway:artery (AA) ratio, 
airway wall thickness:artery ratio (AWTA ratio) and wall area percentage (WAP) 
calculated. Nodule number, size, shape and location was recorded. Correlation 
between CT measurements and pulmonary function testing was performed.
RESULTS: 16 DIPNECH and 16 control subjects were analysed (all female, mean age 
61.7 +/- 11.8 years), a combined total of 425 bronchopulmonary segments. The 
mean AwtA ratio, AA ratio and WAP for the DIPNECH group was 0.57, 1.18 and 
68.8%, respectively, compared with 0.38, 1.03 and 58.3% in controls (p &lt; 
0.001, &lt;0.001, 0.03, respectively). DIPNECH patients had more nodules than 
controls (22.4 +/- 32.6 vs. 3.6 +/- 3.6, p = 0.03). AA ratio correlated with FVC 
(R2 = 0.47, p = 0.02). A multivariable model incorporating nodule number, AA 
ratio and AWTA-ratio demonstrated good performance for discriminating DIPNECH 
and controls (AUC 0.971; 95% CI: 0.925-1.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative CT airway analysis in patients with DIPNECH 
demonstrates increased airway wall thickness and airway:artery ratio compared to 
controls.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Quantitative CT measurement of airway wall thickening 
offers a potential imaging biomarker for treatment response."
1987,"Hormone receptor status is determined primarily to identify breast cancer 
patients who may benefit from hormonal therapy. The current clinical practice 
for the testing using either Allred score or H-score is still based on laborious 
manual counting and estimation of the amount and intensity of positively stained 
cancer cells in immunohistochemistry (IHC)-stained slides. This work integrates 
cell detection and classification workflow for breast carcinoma estrogen 
receptor (ER)-IHC-stained images and presents an automated evaluation system. 
The system first detects all cells within the specific regions and classifies 
them into negatively, weakly, moderately, and strongly stained, followed by 
Allred scoring for ER status evaluation. The generated Allred score relies 
heavily on accurate cell detection and classification and is compared against 
pathologists' manual estimation. Experiments on 40 whole-slide images show 82.5% 
agreement on hormonal treatment recommendation, which we believe could be 
further improved with an advanced learning model and enhancement to address the 
cases with 0% ER status. This promising system can automate the exhaustive 
exercise to provide fast and reliable assistance to pathologists and medical 
personnel. The system has the potential to improve the overall standards of 
prognostic reporting for cancer patients, benefiting pathologists, patients, and 
also the public at large."
1988,"Radiotherapy (RT) plays a crucial role in all stages of lung cancer. Data on 
recent real-world RT patterns and main drivers of RT decisions in lung cancer in 
Romania is scarce; we aimed to address these knowledge gaps through this 
physician-led medical chart review in 16 RT centers across the country. 
Consecutive patients with lung cancer receiving RT as part of their disease 
management between May-October 2019 (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) were included. 
Descriptive statistics were generated for all variables. This cohort included 
422 patients: median age 63 years, males 76%, stages I-II 6%, III 43%, IV 50%, 
mostly adeno- and squamous cell carcinoma (76%), ECOG 0-1 50% at the time of RT. 
Curative intent RT was used in 36% of cases, palliative RT in 64%. Delays were 
reported in 13% of patients, mostly due to machine breakdown (67%). Most acute 
reported RT toxicity was esophagitis (19%). Multiple disease-, patient-, 
physician- and context-related drivers counted in the decision-making process. 
This is the first detailed analysis of RT use in lung cancer in Romania. 
Palliative RT still dominates the landscape. Earlier diagnosis, coordinated 
multidisciplinary strategies, and the true impact of the multimodal treatments 
on survival are strongly needed to improve lung cancer outcomes."
1989,"Traditional breast cancer detection algorithms require manual extraction of 
features from mammogram images and professional medical knowledge. Still, the 
quality of mammogram images hampers this and extracting high-quality features, 
which can result in very long processing times. Therefore, this paper proposes a 
new K-means++ clustering based on Cuckoo Search Optimization (KM++CSO) for 
breast cancer detection. The pre-processing method is used to improve the 
proposed KM++CSO method more segmentation efficiently. Furthermore, the 
interpretability is further enhanced using mathematical morphology and OTSU's 
threshold. To this end, we tested the effectiveness of the KM++CSO methods on 
the mammogram image analysis society of the Mini-Mammographic Image Analysis 
Society (Mini-MIAS), the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM), and 
the Breast Cancer Digital Repository (BCDR) dataset through cross-validation. We 
maximize the accuracy and Jaccard index score, which is a measure that indicates 
the similarity between detected cancer and their corresponding reference cancer 
regions. The experimental results showed that the detection method obtained an 
accuracy of 96.42% (Mini-MIAS), 95.49% (DDSM), and 96.92% (BCDR). On overage, 
the KM++CSO method obtained 96.27% accuracy for three publicly available 
datasets. In addition, the detection results provided the 91.05% Jaccard index 
score."
1990,"In 2020, colorectal cancer was the third most common type of cancer worldwide 
with a clearly visible increase in the number of cases each year. With 
relatively high mortality rates and an uncertain prognosis, colorectal cancer is 
a serious health problem. There is an urgent need to investigate its specific 
mechanism of carcinogenesis and progression in order to develop new strategies 
of action against this cancer. Nectins and Nectin-like molecules are cell 
adhesion molecules that take part in a plethora of essential processes in 
healthy tissues as well as mediating substantial actions for tumor initiation 
and evolution. Our understanding of their role and a viable application of this 
in anti-cancer therapy has rapidly improved in recent years. This review 
summarizes the current data on the role nectins and Nectin-like molecules play 
in colorectal cancer."
1991,"The accuracy of available HPV molecular assays on self-samples needs to be 
evaluated as compared to clinician-collected samples. This pilot study aimed to 
investigate the BD Onclarity™ HPV assay on vaginal and first-void urine samples. 
Sixty-four women referred to colposcopy for cervical dysplasia performed a 
vaginal self-collection and provided a first-void urine sample, after informed 
consent. A cervical specimen was collected during the clinician examination. All 
samples were tested using BD Onclarity™ HPV assay on the BD Viper™ LT System. 
Overall positive agreement (OPA) between cervical and self-sample results was 
evaluated using Cohen's kappa value (κ). Using a clinical cut-off of 38.3 Ct for 
HPV 16 and 34.2 Ct for other HR genotypes, compared to cervical sample, the 
self-collected vaginal sample OPA was 85.9%, and κ = 0.699. Without a clinical 
cut-off, the OPA was 95.3%, and the κ = 0.890. Data obtained comparing cervical 
and urine samples showed an OPA of 87.5% with a κ = 0.79 using a clinical 
cut-off, and an OPA of 90.6% with a κ = 0.776 without a clinical cut-off. Data 
showed a substantial agreement between both self-collected and 
clinician-collected samples. A specific clinical cut-off analysis should be 
considered based on type of sample analysed."
1992,"Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) is an advanced CT computed tomography 
scanning technique enabling material characterization not possible with 
conventional CT scans. It allows the reconstruction of energy decay curves at 
each 3D image voxel, representing varied image attenuation at different 
effective scanning energy levels. In this paper, we develop novel unsupervised 
learning techniques based on mixture models and functional data analysis models 
to the clustering of DECT images. We design functional mixture models that 
integrate spatial image context in mixture weights, with mixture component 
densities being constructed upon the DECT energy decay curves as functional 
observations. We develop dedicated expectation-maximization algorithms for the 
maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. To our knowledge, this is 
the first article to develop statistical functional data analysis and 
model-based clustering techniques to take advantage of the full spectral 
information provided by DECT. We evaluate the application of DECT to head and 
neck squamous cell carcinoma. Current image-based evaluation of these tumors in 
clinical practice is largely qualitative, based on a visual assessment of tumor 
anatomic extent and basic one- or two-dimensional tumor size measurements. We 
evaluate our methods on 91 head and neck cancer DECT scans and compare our 
unsupervised clustering results to tumor contours traced manually by 
radiologists, as well as to several baseline algorithms. Given the inter-rater 
variability even among experts at delineating head and neck tumors, and given 
the potential importance of tissue reactions surrounding the tumor itself, our 
proposed methodology has the potential to add value in downstream machine 
learning applications for clinical outcome prediction based on DECT data in head 
and neck cancer."
1993,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most lethal genitourinary malignancy. Obesity 
is a risk factor for RCC development. The role of adipokines in the relationship 
between obesity and RCC requires confirmatory evidence in the form of a 
systematic review and meta-analysis, specifically for visfatin, omentin-1, 
nesfatin-1 and apelin. A search of databases up to July 2022 (PubMed, Web of 
Science and Scopus) for studies reporting the association of these selected 
adipokines with RCC was conducted. A total of 13 studies fulfilled the selection 
criteria. Only visfatin (p &lt; 0.05) and nesfatin-1 (p &lt; 0.05) had a 
significant association with RCC. Meanwhile, apelin and omentin-1 showed no 
association with RCC. The meta-analysis results of nesfatin-1 showed no 
association with early-stage (OR = 0.09, 95% CI = -0.12-0.29, p = 0.41), 
late-stage (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.07-1.89, p = 0.23) and low-grade (OR = 1.75, 
95% CI = 0.37-8.27, p = 0.48) RCC. However, nesfatin-1 showed an association 
with a high grade of the disease (OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.13-0.61, p = 0.001) and 
poorer overall survival (OS) (HR = 3.86, 95% CI = 2.18-6.85; p &lt; 0.01). 
Apelin showed no association with the risk of RCC development (mean difference = 
21.15, 95% CI = -23.69-65.99, p = 0.36) and OS (HR = 1.04, 95% Cl = 0.45-2.41; p 
= 0.92). Although the number of studies evaluated was limited, analysis from 
this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that visfatin and nesfatin-1 
were elevated. In summary, these adipokines may play a role in the development 
and progression of RCC and hence may have potential diagnostic and prognostic 
capabilities for RCC."
1994,"The development of genomic technology for smart diagnosis and therapies for 
various diseases has lately been the most demanding area for computer-aided 
diagnostic and treatment research. Exponential breakthroughs in artificial 
intelligence and machine intelligence technologies could pave the way for 
identifying challenges afflicting the healthcare industry. Genomics is paving 
the way for predicting future illnesses, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, 
and diabetes. Machine learning advancements have expedited the pace of 
biomedical informatics research and inspired new branches of computational 
biology. Furthermore, knowing gene relationships has resulted in developing more 
accurate models that can effectively detect patterns in vast volumes of data, 
making classification models important in various domains. Recurrent Neural 
Network models have a memory that allows them to quickly remember knowledge from 
previous cycles and process genetic data. The present work focuses on type 2 
diabetes prediction using gene sequences derived from genomic DNA fragments 
through automated feature selection and feature extraction procedures for 
matching gene patterns with training data. The suggested model was tested using 
tabular data to predict type 2 diabetes based on several parameters. The 
performance of neural networks incorporating Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) 
components, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) was 
tested in this research. The model's efficiency is assessed using the evaluation 
metrics such as Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, F1-Score, and Mathews 
Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The suggested technique predicted future 
illnesses with fair Accuracy. Furthermore, our research showed that the 
suggested model could be used in real-world scenarios and that input risk

1995,"Background: Colposcopy plays an essential role in cervical cancer control, but 
its performance remains unsatisfactory. This study evaluates the feasibility of 
machine learning (ML) models for predicting high-grade squamous intraepithelial 
lesions or worse (HSIL+) in patients referred for colposcopy by combining 
colposcopic findings with demographic and screening results. Methods: In total, 
7485 patients who underwent colposcopy examination in seven hospitals in 
mainland China were used to train, internally validate, and externally validate 
six commonly used ML models, including logistic regression, decision tree, naïve 
bayes, support vector machine, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting. 
Nine variables, including age, gravidity, parity, menopause status, cytological 
results, high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection type, HR-HPV 
multi-infection, transformation zone (TZ) type, and colposcopic impression, were 
used for model construction. Results: Colposcopic impression, HR-HPV results, 
and cytology results were the top three variables that determined model 
performance among all included variables. In the internal validation set, six ML 
models that integrated demographics, screening results, and colposcopic 
impression showed significant improvements in the area under the curve (AUC) 
(0.067 to 0.099) and sensitivity (11.55% to 14.88%) compared with colposcopists. 
Greater increases in AUC (0.087 to 0.119) and sensitivity (17.17% to 22.08%) 
were observed in the six models with the external validation set. Conclusions: 
By incorporating demographics, screening results, and colposcopic impressions, 
ML improved the AUC and sensitivity for detecting HSIL+ in patients referred for 
colposcopy. Such models could transform the subjective experience into objective 
judgments to help clinicians make decisions at the time of colposcopy 
examinations."
1996,"BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) and robotic-assisted 
bronchoscopy (RAB) systems are used for pulmonary lesion sampling, and utilize a 
pre-procedural CT scan where an airway, or ""bronchus sign"", is used to map a 
pathway to the target lesion. However, up to 40% of pre-procedural CT's lack a 
""bronchus sign"" partially due to surrounding emphysema or limitation in CT 
resolution. Recognizing that the branches of the pulmonary artery, lymphatics, 
and airways are often present together as the bronchovascular bundle, we 
postulate that a branch of the pulmonary artery (""artery sign"") could be used 
for pathway mapping during navigation bronchoscopy when a ""bronchus sign"" is 
absent. Herein we describe the navigation success and safety of using the 
""artery sign"" to create a pathway for pulmonary lesion sampling.
METHODS: We reviewed data on consecutive cases in which the ""artery sign"" was 
used for pre-procedural planning for conventional ENB (superDimension™, 
Medtronic) and RAB (Monarch™, Johnson & Johnson). Patients who underwent these 
procedures from July 2020 until July 2021 at the University of Minnesota Medical 
Center and from June 2018 until December 2019 at the University of Chicago 
Medical Center were included in this analysis (IRB #19-0011 for the University 
of Chicago and IRB #00013135 for the University of Minnesota). The primary 
outcome was navigation success, defined as successfully maneuvering the 
bronchoscope to the target lesion based on feedback from the navigation system. 
Secondary outcomes included navigation success based on radial EBUS imaging, 
pneumothorax, and bleeding rates.
RESULTS: A total of 30 patients were enrolled in this analysis. The median 
diameter of the lesions was 17 mm. The median distance of the lesion from the 
pleura was 5 mm. Eleven lesions were solid, 15 were pure ground glass, and 4 
were mixed. All cases were planned successfully using the ""artery sign"" on 
either the superDimension™ ENB (n = 15) or the Monarch™ RAB (n = 15). Navigation 
to the target was successful for 29 lesions (96.7%) based on feedback from the 
navigation system (virtual target). Radial EBUS image was acquired in 27 cases 
(90%) [eccentric view in 13 (43.33%) and concentric view in 14 patients 
(46.66%)], while in 3 cases (10%) no r-EBUS view was obtained. Pneumothorax 
occurred in one case (3%). Significant airway bleeding was reported in one case 
(3%).
CONCLUSIONS: We describe the concept of using the ""artery sign"" as an 
alternative for planning EMN and RAB procedures when ""bronchus sign"" is absent. 
The navigation success based on virtual target or r-EBUS imaging is high and 
safety of sampling of such lesions compares favorably with prior reports. 
Prospective studies are needed to assess the impact of the ""artery sign"" on 
diagnostic yield."
1997,"Risk-reducing surgery (RRS) is recommended in BRCA-mutated carriers because of 
their increased risk of developing ovarian cancer, while its role is still 
discussed for women harboring mutations in non-BRCA homologous repair genes. The 
aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the occurrence of pathological 
findings in a high-risk population undergoing RRS in San Matteo Hospital, Pavia 
between 2012 and 2022, and correlate their genetic and clinical outcomes, 
comparing them with a control group. The final cohort of 190 patients included 
85 BRCA1, 63 BRCA2, 11 CHEK2, 7 PALB2, 4 ATM, 1 ERCC5, 1 RAD51C, 1 CDH1, 1 MEN1, 
1 MLH1 gene mutation carriers and 15 patients with no known mutation but with 
strong familial risk. Occult invasive serous carcinoma (HGSC) and serous tubal 
intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) were diagnosed in 12 (6.3%) women, all of them 
BRCA carriers. No neoplastic lesion was diagnosed in the non-BRCA group, in 
women with familial risk, or in the control group. Oral contraceptive use and 
age ≤45 at surgery were both found to be favorable factors. While p53 signature 
and serous tubal intraepithelial lesion (STIL) were also seen in the control 
group and in non-BRCA carriers, STIC and HGSC were only found in BRCA1/2 
mutation carriers."
1998,"p53, initially considered a tumor suppressor, has been the subject of research 
related to cancer treatment resistance in the last 30 years. The unfavorable 
response to multimodal therapy and the higher recurrence rate, despite an 
aggressive approach, make HNSCC a research topic of interest for improving 
therapeutic outcomes, even if it is only the sixth most common malignancy 
worldwide. New advances in molecular biology and genetics include the 
involvement of miRNA in the control of the p53 pathway, the understanding of 
mechanisms such as gain/loss of function, and the development of different 
methods to restore p53 function, especially for HPV-negative cases. The 
different ratio between mutant p53 status in the primary tumor and distant 
metastasis originating HNSCC may serve to select the best therapeutic target for 
activating an abscopal effect by radiotherapy as a ""booster"" of the immune 
system. P53 may also be a key player in choosing radiotherapy fractionation 
regimens. Targeting any pathway involving p53, including tumor metabolism, in 
particular the Warburg effect, could modulate the radiosensitivity and 
chemo-sensitivity of head and neck cancers."
1999,"Clinical trials are the most effective tools to evaluate the advantages of 
various diagnostic and treatment modalities. AI used in medical issues,

outcomes and patient experiences. This study's objective was to investigate the 
traits of registered trials on artificial intelligence for lung disease. 
Clinical studies on AI for lung disease that were present in the 
ClinicalTrials.gov database were searched, and fifty-three registered trials 
were included. Forty-six (72.1%) were observational trials, compared to seven 
(27.9%) that were interventional trials. Only eight trials (15.4%) were 
completed. Thirty (56.6%) trials were accepting applicants. Clinical studies 
often included a large number of cases; for example, 24 (32.0%) trials included 
samples of 100-1000 cases, while 14 (17.5%) trials included samples of 1000-2000 
cases. Of the interventional trials, twenty (15.7%) were retrospective studies

2000,"Since the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, there has been an 
unprecedented increase in the acquisition of chest computed tomography (CT) 
scans. Nearly 616 million people have been infected by COVID-19 worldwide to 
date, of whom many were subjected to CT scanning. CT exposes the patients to 
hazardous ionizing radiation, which can damage the genetic material in the 
cells, leading to stochastic health effects in the form of heritable genetic 
mutations and increased cancer risk. These probabilistic, long-term carcinogenic 
effects of radiation can be seen over a lifetime and may sometimes take several 
decades to manifest. This review briefly describes what is known about the 
health effects of radiation, the lowest dose for which there exists compelling 
evidence about increased radiation-induced cancer risk and the evidence 
regarding this risk at typical CT doses. The lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of 
cancer from low- and standard-dose chest CT scans performed in COVID-19 subjects 
is also discussed along with the projected number of future cancers that could 
be related to chest CT scans performed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The LAR of 
cancer Incidence from chest CT has also been compared with those from other

malignant and heterogeneous disease with distinct molecular subtypes, which has 
prognostic and predictive implications. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), cell-free 
fragmented tumor-derived DNA in blood plasma, is an invaluable source of 
specific cancer-associated mutations and holds great promise for the development 
of minimally invasive diagnostic tests. Furthermore, serial monitoring of ctDNA 
over the course of systemic and targeted therapies not only allows unparalleled 
efficacy assessments but also enables the identification of patients who are at 
risk of progression or recurrence. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a powerful 
technique for the detection and monitoring of ctDNA. Due to its relatively high 
accuracy, sensitivity, reproducibility, and capacity for absolute 
quantification, it is increasingly used as a tool for managing cancer patients 
through liquid biopsies. In this review paper, we gauge the clinical utility of 
ddPCR as a technique for mutational profiling in breast cancer patients and 
focus on HER2, PIK3CA, ESR1, and TP53, which represent the most frequently 
mutated genes in breast cancers."
2002,"Restoring information obstructed by hair is one of the main issues for the 
accurate analysis and segmentation of skin images. For retrieving pixels 
obstructed by hair, the proposed system converts dermoscopy images into the 
L*a*b* color space, then principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to 
produce grayscale images. Afterward, the contrast-limited adaptive histogram 
equalization (CLAHE) and the average filter are implemented to enhance the 
grayscale image. Subsequently, the binary image is generated using the iterative 
thresholding method. After that, the Hough transform (HT) is applied to each 
image block to generate the hair mask. Finally, the hair pixels are removed by 
harmonic inpainting. The performance of the proposed automated hair removal was 
evaluated by applying the proposed system to the International Skin Imaging 
Collaboration (ISIC) dermoscopy dataset as well as to clinical images. Six 
performance evaluation metrics were measured, namely the mean squared error 
(MSE), the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 
the structural similarity index (SSIM), the universal quality image index (UQI), 
and the correlation (C). Using the clinical dataset, the system achieved MSE, 
PSNR, SNR, SSIM, UQI, and C values of 34.7957, 66.98, 42.39, 0.9813, 0.9801, and 
0.9985, respectively. The results demonstrated that the proposed system could 
satisfy the medical diagnostic requirements and achieve the best performance 
compared to the state-of-art."
2003,"To save lives from cancer, it is very crucial to diagnose it at its early 
stages. One solution to early diagnosis lies in the identification of the cancer 
driver genes and their mutations. Such diagnostics can substantially minimize 
the mortality rate of this deadly disease. However, concurrently, the 
identification of cancer driver gene mutation through experimental mechanisms 
could be an expensive, slow, and laborious job. The advancement of computational 
strategies that could help in the early prediction of cancer growth effectively 
and accurately is thus highly needed towards early diagnoses and a decrease in 
the mortality rates due to this disease. Herein, we aim to predict clear cell 
renal carcinoma (RCCC) at the level of the genes, using the genomic sequences. 
The dataset was taken from IntOgen Cancer Mutations Browser and all genes' 
standard DNA sequences were taken from the NCBI database. Using 
cancer-associated information of mutation from INTOGEN, the benchmark dataset 
was generated by creating the mutations in original sequences. After extensive 
feature extraction, the dataset was used to train ANN+ Hist Gradient boosting 
that could perform the classification of RCCC genes, other cancer-associated 
genes, and non-cancerous/unknown (non-tumor driver) genes. Through an 
independent dataset test, the accuracy observed was 83%, whereas the 10-fold 
cross-validation and Jackknife validation yielded 98% and 100% accurate results, 
respectively. The proposed predictor RCCC_Pred is able to identify RCCC genes 
with high accuracy and efficiency and can help scientists/researchers easily 
predict and diagnose cancer at its early stages."
2004,"Thoracic diseases refer to disorders that affect the lungs, heart, and other 
parts of the rib cage, such as pneumonia, novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), 
tuberculosis, cardiomegaly, and fracture. Millions of people die every year from 
thoracic diseases. Therefore, early detection of these diseases is essential and 
can save many lives. Earlier, only highly experienced radiologists examined 
thoracic diseases, but recent developments in image processing and deep learning 
techniques are opening the door for the automated detection of these diseases. 
In this paper, we present a comprehensive review including: types of thoracic 
diseases; examination types of thoracic images; image pre-processing; models of 
deep learning applied to the detection of thoracic diseases (e.g., pneumonia, 
COVID-19, edema, fibrosis, tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), and lung cancer); transfer learning background knowledge; ensemble 
learning; and future initiatives for improving the efficacy of deep learning 
models in applications that detect thoracic diseases. Through this survey paper, 
researchers may be able to gain an overall and systematic knowledge of deep 
learning applications in medical thoracic images. The review investigates a 
performance comparison of various models and a comparison of various datasets."
2005,"BACKGROUND: atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) is a precancerous condition 
implying a high risk of concurrent endometrial cancer (EC), which might be 
occult and only diagnosed at postoperative histopathological examination after 
hysterectomy. Our study aimed to investigate potential differences in 
preoperative clinical, sonographic, and hysteroscopic characteristics in 
patients with AEH and postoperative diagnosis of EC.
METHODS: a retrospective single-center study was carried out on a case series of 
80 women with AEH undergoing diagnostic workup, including ultrasonography and 
hysteroscopy, with subsequent hysterectomy. Women with AEH confirmed at the 
histopathological examination were compared with patients with a postoperative 
diagnosis of EC.
RESULTS: in our population, EC was diagnosed in 53 women, whereas the 
preoperative diagnosis of AEH was confirmed in 27 cases. At ultrasonography, 
women with occult EC showed greater endometrial thickness (20.3 mm vs. 10.3 mm, 
p 0.001) and size of the endocavitary lesion (maximum diameter 25.2 mm vs. 10.6 
mm, p 0.001), and a higher prevalence of irregular endometrial-myometrial 
junction (40.5% vs. 6.7%, p 0.022) and endouterine vascularization at color 
Doppler (64.2% vs. 34.6%, p 0.017). At hysteroscopy, patients with occult EC 
showed a higher prevalence of necrosis (44.2% vs. 4.2%, p 0.001) and atypical 
vessels (70.6% vs. 33.3%, p 0.003), whereas true AEH mainly presented as a 
protruding intracavitary lesion (77.8% vs. 50.9%, p 0.029). In EC, subjective 
assessment by the operator was more frequently indicative of cancer (80.0% vs. 
12.5%). No difference was found for clinical variables.
CONCLUSIONS: occult EC in AEH may exhibit some differences in ultrasonographic 
and hysteroscopic patterns of presentation compared with real AEH, which could 
prompt a more significant suspect for the possible presence of concurrent EC at 
preoperative diagnostic workup."
2006,"BACKGROUND: Diffusion-weighted imaging and elastography are widely accepted 
methods in the evaluation of breast masses, however, there is very limited data 
comparing the two methods. The apparent diffusion coefficient is a measure of 
the diffusion of water molecules obtained by diffusion-weighted imaging as a 
part of breast MRI. Breast elastography is an adjunct to conventional 
ultrasonography, which provides a noninvasive evaluation of the stiffness of the 
lesion. Theoretically, increased tissue density and stiffness are related to 
each other. The purpose of this study is to compare MRI ADC values of the breast 
masses with quantitative elastography based on ultrasound shear wave 
measurements and to investigate their possible relation with the prognostic 
factors and molecular subtypes.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated histopathologically proven 147 breast 
lesions. The molecular classification of malignant lesions was made according to 
the prognostic factors. Shear wave elastography was measured in kiloPascal (kPa) 
units which is a quantitative measure of tissue stiffness. DWI was obtained 
using a 1.5-T MRI system.
RESULTS: ADC values were strongly inversely correlated with elasticity (r = 
-0.662, p &lt; 0.01) according to Pearson Correlation. In our study, the cut-off 
value of ADC was 1.00 × 10-3 cm2/s to achieve a sensitivity of 84.6% and 
specificity of 75.4%, and the cut-off value of elasticity was 105.5 kPa to 
achieve the sensitivity of 96.3% and specificity 76.9% to discriminate between 
the malignant and benign breast lesions. The status of prognostic factors was 
not correlated with the ADC values and elasticity.
CONCLUSIONS: Elasticity and ADC values are correlated. Both cannot predict the 
status of prognostic factors and differentiate between molecular subtypes."
2007,"Several endoscopic findings obtained by magnifying image-enhanced endoscopy 
(IEE) are reportedly correlated with gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM); 
however, the differences between magnifying and nonmagnifying IEE for the 
diagnosis of gastric IM remain unknown. This study included 100 consecutive 
patients who underwent narrow-band imaging endoscopy. Four areas of the stomach 
were evaluated using nonmagnifying and magnifying IEE. Light-blue crest (LBC), 
white opaque substance (WOS), and endoscopic grading of the gastric IM (EGGIM) 
were assessed. The concordance rates between nonmagnifying and magnifying IEE 
were 80.5% for LBC and 93.3% for WOS. The strength of agreement between each 
observation technique showed good reproducibility, with a kappa value of 0.69 
and 0.83 for LBC and WOS, respectively. The individual EGGIM score indicated a 
good correlation between nonmagnifying and magnifying IEE (concordance rate, 
75%; kappa value, 0.67). The prevalence of a high EGGIM score in patients with 
and without gastric cancer (GC) showed a significant difference both with 
nonmagnifying IEE (odds ratio (OR), 3.3; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-9.0), 
and magnifying IEE (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.9). Nonmagnifying IEE has the 
potential to stratify the individual risk of GC, similar to magnifying IEE, 
warranting further investigation with histological assessment."
2008,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare cancer characterized by a very poor 
prognosis. Exposure to asbestos is the leading cause of malignant pleural 
mesothelioma. The preinvasive lesions, the mesothelial hyperplasia and its 
possible evolution are the focus of the majority of the studies aiming to 
identify the treatable phase of the disease. The role of BAP-1 and MTAP in the 
diagnosis of mesothelioma in situ and in the prognosis of malignant pleural 
mesothelioma is the main topic of recent studies. The management of preinvasive 
lesions in mesothelioma is still unclear and many aspects are the subject of 
debate. The diagnosis, the disease staging and the accurate, comprehensive 
assessment of patients are three key instants for an appropriate management of 
patients/the disease."
2009,"(1) Background: It is widely accepted that aberrant methylation patterns 
contribute to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Ten-eleven 
translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase is an essential enzyme of which 
there are three members, TET1, 2, and 3, involved in hydroxymethylation, a newly 
uncovered mechanism of active DNA methylation. The epigenomes of gene 
transcription are regulated by 5-hydroxymethylcytocine (5-hmC) and TETs, leading 
to dysregulation of the immune system in SLE. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the global hydroxymethylation status in SLE peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and to explore the role of TETs in changing the 
patterns of methylation. (2) Methods: We collected PBMCs from 101 SLE patients 
and 100 healthy donors. TaqMan real-time polymerase chain-reaction assay was 
performed for the detection of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), 5-hmC, and TET2 mRNA 
expression and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. The methylation rates 
in different CpG sites of TET2 promoters were examined using next-generation 
sequencing-based deep bisulfite sequencing. Putative transcription factors were 
investigated using the UCSC Genome Browser on the Human Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38) 
Assembly. (3) Results: 5-mC and 5-hmC were both decreased in SLE. The mRNA 
expression level of TET2 was notably high and found to be correlated with the 
levels of immunologic biomarkers that are indicative of SLE disease activity. 
The analysis of methylation rates in the TET2 promoter revealed that SLE 
patients had significantly higher and lower rates of methylation in TET2 
105146072-154 and TET2 105146218-331, respectively. (4) Conclusions: TET2 may 
play an important role in 5-mC/5-hmC dynamics in the PBMCs of SLE patients. The 
epigenetic modification of TET2 promoters could contribute to the pathogenesis 
of SLE and the intensity of the immunologic reaction."
2010,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish a predictive nomogram for 
predicting prostate cancer (PCa) in patients with gray-zone prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) levels (4-10.0 ng/mL) based on radiomics and other traditional 
clinical parameters.
METHODS: In all, 274 patients with gray-zone PSA levels were included in this 
retrospective study. They were randomly divided into training and validation 
sets (n = 191 and 83, respectively). Data on the clinical risk factors related 
to PCa with gray-zone PSA levels (such as Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data 
System, version 2.1 [PI-RADS V2.1] category, age, prostate volume, and serum PSA 
level) were collected for all patients. Lesion volumes of interest (VOI) from 
T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging were 
annotated by two radiologists. The radiomics model, clinical model, and combined 
prediction model, which was presented on a nomogram by incorporating the 
radiomics signature and clinical and radiological risk factors for PCa, were 
developed using logistic regression. The area under the receiver operator 
characteristic (AUC-ROC) and decision, calibration curve were used to compare 
the three models for the diagnosis of PCa with gray-zone PSA levels.
RESULTS: The predictive nomogram (AUC: 0.953) incorporating the radiomics score 
and PI-RADS V2.1 category, age, and the radiomics model (AUC: 0.941) afforded 
much higher diagnostic efficacy than the clinical model (AUC: 0.866). The 
addition of the rad score could improve the discriminatory performance of the 
clinical model. The decision curve analysis indicated that the radiomics or 
combined model could be more beneficial compared to the clinical model for the 
prediction of PCa. The nomogram showed good agreement for detecting PCa with 
gray-zone PSA levels between prediction and histopathologic confirmation.
CONCLUSION: The nomogram, which combined the radiomics score and PI-RADS V2.1 
category and age, is an effective and non-invasive method for predicting PCa. 
Furthermore, as well as good calibration and is clinically useful, which could 
reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in patients having PCa with gray-zone PSA 
levels."
2011,"Asynclitism, the most feared malposition of the fetal head during labor, still 
represents to date an unresolved field of interest, remaining one of the most 
common causes of prolonged or obstructed labor, dystocia, assisted delivery, and 
cesarean section. Traditionally asynclitism is diagnosed by vaginal examination, 
which is, however, burdened by a high grade of bias. On the contrary, the recent 
scientific evidence highly suggests the use of intrapartum ultrasonography, 
which would be more accurate and reliable when compared to the vaginal 
examination for malposition assessment. The early detection and characterization 
of asynclitism by intrapartum ultrasound would become a valid tool for 
intrapartum evaluation. In this way, it will be possible for physicians to opt 
for the safest way of delivery according to an accurate definition of the fetal 
head position and station, avoiding unnecessary operative procedures and 
medication while improving fetal and maternal outcomes. This review re-evaluated 
the literature of the last 30 years on asynclitism, focusing on the progressive 
imposition of ultrasound as an intrapartum diagnostic tool. All the evidence 
emerging from the literature is presented and evaluated from our point of view, 
describing the most employed technique and considering the future implication of 
the progressive worldwide consolidation of asynclitism and ultrasound."
2012,"Pseudo-anodontia consists in the clinical, not radiographic, absence of teeth, 
due to failure in their eruption. It has been reported as part of an extremely 
rare syndrome, named GAPO syndrome. Pseudo-hypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHPT-1a) 
is a rare condition, characterized by resistance to the parathyroid hormone 
(PTH), as well as to many other hormones, and resulting in hypocalcemia, 
hyperphosphatemia, and elevated PTH. We report here the case of a 32-year-old 
woman with a long-standing history of non-treated hypocalcemia, in the context 
of an undiagnosed PHPT-1a. She had an intellectual disability, showed clinical 
features of the Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) and presented signs of 
multiple hormone resistances. She received treatment for seizures since the age 
of six. Examination of her mouth revealed a complete absence of teeth. Treatment 
of hypocalcemia and hormone deficiencies were started only at 29 years of age. 
Genetic testing demonstrated the presence of a frameshift variant in the GNAS 
gene in the proband as well as in her mother. A Single Nucleotide Polymorphism 
(SNP) array analysis failed to demonstrate pathogenic copy number variants 
(CNVs) but showed several regions with loss of heterozygosity (LOHs) for a final 
percentage of 1.75%, compatible with a fifth degree of relationship. Clinical 
exome sequencing (CES) ruled out any damaging variants in all the teeth 
agenesis-related genes. In conclusion, although we performed an extensive 
genetic analysis in search of possible additional gene alterations that could 
explain the presence of the peculiar phenotypic characteristics observed in our 
patient, we could not find any additional genetic defects. Our results suggest 
that the association of genetically confirmed PHPT-1a and complete 
pseudo-anodontia associated with persistent patchy alopecia areata is a new 
additional nonclassical feature related to the GNAS pathogenic variant."
2013,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification remains the most pivotal epigenetic 
modification on RNA. As we know, m6A not only affects physiological processes 
but is also involved in carcinoma. Noncoding RNAs play an indispensable role in 
the occurrence and development of carcinoma. However, a large amount of research 
is focused on mRNA currently. Insufficient research has been done on the 
relationship between noncoding RNA (ncRNA) methylation and cancer. Therefore, 
this review aims to introduce the theoretical knowledge of m6A modification in 
noncoding RNA, discuss its function in tumorigenesis and progression, and 
ultimately summarize its potential clinical applications."
2014,"The purpose of this study is to clarify the associations between the enhancement 
patterns on contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound (CH-EUS) and the 
aggressiveness and prognosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PanNENs). 
Patients who underwent CH-EUS and were pathologically diagnosed with PanNEN were 
included in this study. Patients were divided into three groups according to 
contrast-enhancement patterns on early-phase and late-phase imaging: ""Group A"", 
vascular rich in both phases; ""Group B"", vascular rich and vascular poor in 
early and late phases, respectively; ""Group C"", vascular poor in both phases. Of 
39 patients, 25 were assigned to Group A, 7 to Group B, and 7 to Group C. The 
median overall survival was not reached in Groups A and B and was 335 days in 
Group C (p &lt; 0.001). The 1-year survival rates were 100% in Group A, 60% in 
Group B, and 43% in Group C. Patients in Group C showed the shortest overall 
survival among the three groups. The vascular-poor pattern on late-phase CH-EUS 
had the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for aggressive PanNENs 
among the patterns analyzed on CH-EUS and CECT (84.6%, 91.7%, and 89.2%, 
respectively). CH-EUS is useful for the diagnosis of and predicting the 
prognosis of PanNENs."
2015,"Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world. In terms 
of the diagnosis of lung cancer, combination carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and 
cancer antigen 125 (CA125) detection had higher sensitivity, specificity, and 
diagnostic odds ratios than CEA detection alone. Most individuals with elevated 
serum CA125 levels had lung cancer that was either in stage 3 or stage 4. Serum 
CA125 levels were similarly elevated in lung cancer patients who also had 
pleural effusions or ascites. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that human 
lung cancer produces CA125 in vitro, which suggests that other clinical 
illnesses outside of ovarian cancer could also be responsible for the rise of 
CA125. MUC16 (CA125) is a natural killer cell inhibitor. As a screening test for 
lung and ovarian cancer diagnosis and prognosis in the early stages, CA125 has 
been widely used as a marker in three different clinical settings. MUC16 mRNA 
levels in lung cancer are increased regardless of gender. As well, increased 
expression of mutated MUC16 enhances lung cancer cells proliferation and growth. 
Additionally, the CA125 serum level is thought to be a key indicator for lung 
cancer metastasis to the liver. Further, CA125 could be a useful biomarker in 
other cancer types diagnoses like ovarian, breast, and pancreatic cancers. One 
of the important limitations of CA125 as a first step in such a screening 
technique is that up to 20% of ovarian tumors lack antigen expression. Each of 
the 10 possible serum markers was expressed in 29-100% of ovarian tumors with 
minimal or no CA125 expression. Therefore, there is a controversy regarding 
CA125 in the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer and other cancer types. In 
this state, preclinical and clinical studies are warranted to elucidate the 
clinical benefit of CA125 in the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer."
2016,"Radioiodine remnant ablation (RRA) was previously demonstrated to be a safe and 
effective alternative to completion thyroidectomy for patients with 
differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). However, its side effects have not been 
fully investigated, particularly in patients with lobectomy. We reported a young 
euthyroidal female who underwent RRA post lobectomy and lymph node dissection 
for papillary thyroid cancer, whose post-ablation 131I-whole-body scan 
accidentally showed diffuse radioiodine distribution on chest-mimicking 
pulmonary metastases. Immediately-added single-photon emission computed 
tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT), nevertheless, revealed a 
131I-accumulating swollen left thyroid lobe and emerging pleural effusion, which 
relieved after short-term treatment with prednisone. In summary, acute pleural 
effusion ascribed to RRA-induced thoracic duct compression was reported for the 
first time. 131I-lobectomy-induced pleural effusion could be precisely diagnosed 
by SPECT/CT and efficiently manipulated via treating radiation thyroiditis with 
the short-term administration of corticosteroid."
2017,"Vaccines are an upcoming medical intervention for breast cancer. By targeting 
the tumor antigen, cancer vaccines can be designed to train the immune system to 
recognize tumor cells. Therefore, along with technological advances, the vaccine 
design process is now starting to be carried out with more rational methods such 
as designing epitope-based peptide vaccines using immunoinformatics methods. 
Immunoinformatics methods can assist vaccine design in terms of antigenicity and 
safety. Common protocols used to design epitope-based peptide vaccines include 
tumor antigen identification, protein structure analysis, T cell epitope 
prediction, epitope characterization, and evaluation of protein-epitope 
interactions. Tumor antigen can be divided into two types: tumor associated 
antigen and tumor specific antigen. We will discuss the identification of tumor 
antigens using high-throughput technologies. Protein structure analysis 
comprises the physiochemical, hydrochemical, and antigenicity of the protein. T 
cell epitope prediction models are widely available with various prediction 
parameters as well as filtering tools for the prediction results. Epitope 
characterization such as allergenicity and toxicity can be done in silico as 
well using allergenicity and toxicity predictors. Evaluation of protein-epitope 
interactions can also be carried out in silico with molecular simulation. We 
will also discuss current and future developments of breast cancer vaccines 
using an immunoinformatics approach. Finally, although prediction models have 
high accuracy, the opposite can happen after being tested in vitro and in vivo. 
Therefore, further studies are needed to ensure the effectiveness of the vaccine 
to be developed. Although epitope-based peptide vaccines have the disadvantage 
of low immunogenicity, the addition of adjuvants can be a solution."
2018,"The abnormal growth of cells in the skin causes two types of tumor: benign and 
malignant. Various methods, such as imaging and biopsies, are used by 
oncologists to assess the presence of skin cancer, but these are time-consuming 
and require extra human effort. However, some automated methods have been 
developed by researchers based on hand-crafted feature extraction from skin 
images. Nevertheless, these methods may fail to detect skin cancers at an early 
stage if they are tested on unseen data. Therefore, in this study, a novel and 
robust skin cancer detection model was proposed based on features fusion. First, 
our proposed model pre-processed the images using a GF filter to remove the 
noise. Second, the features were manually extracted by employing local binary 
patterns (LBP), and Inception V3 for automatic feature extraction. Aside from 
this, an Adam optimizer was utilized for the adjustments of learning rate. In 
the end, LSTM network was utilized on fused features for the classification of 
skin cancer into malignant and benign. Our proposed system employs the benefits 
of both ML- and DL-based algorithms. We utilized the skin lesion DermIS dataset, 
which is available on the Kaggle website and consists of 1000 images, out of 
which 500 belong to the benign class and 500 to the malignant class. The 
proposed methodology attained 99.4% accuracy, 98.7% precision, 98.66% recall, 
and a 98% F-score. We compared the performance of our features fusion-based 
method with existing segmentation-based and DL-based techniques. Additionally, 
we cross-validated the performance of our proposed model using 1000 images from 
International Skin Image Collection (ISIC), attaining 98.4% detection accuracy. 
The results show that our method provides significant results compared to 
existing techniques and outperforms them."
2019,"BACKGROUND: The Hippo signaling pathway has a key role in tumorigenesis. This 
study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the expression of core 
components of the Hippo signaling pathway and its association with 
clinicopathological features in endometrial cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected endometrioid endometrial 
cancer specimens from 60 patients between January 2002 and December 2009 at 
Gyeongsang National University Hospital. Relevant clinicopathological data were 
obtained through electronic medical records of patients. The expression patterns 
of six core components (YAP, p-YAP, LATS1/2, MST1/2, KIBRA, and Merlin) were 
identified by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray sections.
RESULTS: The positive expression ratio was 75.0% for YAP, 73.3% for p-YAP, 26.7% 
for MST1/2, 16.7% for KIBRA, 15.0% for Merlin, and 15.0% for LATS1/2. YAP 
expression was negatively correlated with MST 1/2 kinases (p = 0.045) and 
positively correlated with p-YAP (p = 0.012). Merlin, and MST 1/2 kinases (p = 
0.043) showed a positive correlation. A subgroup of patients aged below 60 years 
(p = 0.004) and with myometrial invasion depth of less than 1/2 (p = 0.041) 
showed a positive association with YAP expression. p-YAP expression was 
negatively associated with a subset of patients with primary tumour size ≥4 cm 
(p = 0.03). Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association 
between age and YAP expression. The odds ratio of p-YAP expression was 
significantly lower in the group with tumour size ≥4 cm.
CONCLUSION: Two prognostic factors, age and tumour size, were significantly 
associated with the expression of YAP and p-YAP in endometrial cancer. Further 
research should focus on their expression as a marker for prediction of 
clinicopathological implications in endometrial cancer."
2020,"The objectives of this study were to investigate the mean collagen content of 
the atlanto-axial joint (AAJ) ligaments in a cohort without inflammatory disease 
and to analyze clinical confounders such as age, sex, and presence of 
ligamentous calcifications. A total of 153 patients who underwent dual-energy 
computed tomography (DECT) due to various reasons (e.g., suspected cancer or 
infection) were included in this retrospective study. Reconstruction of collagen 
density maps from the DECT dataset was performed. Region of interest (ROI) 
analysis was performed to assess densities in the following regions: ligamentum 
transversum atlantis (LTA), ligamenta alaria, fasciculi longitudinales, 
ligamentum nuchae, and retro-odontoid soft tissue (RDS). Osteoarthritis (OA) and 
the presence of calcifications were assessed by two experienced readers blinded 
to clinical data. Subgroup comparisons were performed using unpaired t-tests. 
The correlation of collagen density and clinical factors was investigated using 
Pearson's correlation coefficient. Mean LTA collagen density was 141.7 (SD 
35.7). Ligamentous calcifications were rare (14.4 %). OA of the AAJ was common 
(91.5 %). LTA collagen density was not associated with age (Pearson's r of 
0.109; p = 0.180) and was not significantly higher in patients with OA (p = 
0.070). No correlations between RDS thickness, collagen density or 
calcifications were found. Our results show collagen density mapping of the 
cranio-cervical joint ligaments to be feasible; collagen densities are not 
significantly associated with age, sex, AAJ degeneration, or asymptomatic 
ligamentous calcification."
2021,"Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an MRI-based technique for iron 
quantification of targeted tissue. QSM provides information relevant to 
clinicians in a broad range of diagnostic contexts, including sickle cell

vendors do not offer QSM post-processing in a form ready for general use. This 
work describes a vendor-agnostic approach for scaling QSM analysis from a 
research technique to a routine diagnostic test. We provide the details needed 
to seamlessly integrate hardware, software, and clinical systems to provide QSM 
processing for a busy clinical radiology workflow. This approach can be 
generalized to other advanced MRI acquisitions and analyses with proven 
diagnostic utility, yet without crucial MR vendor support."

known. This study aims to calculate the pooled prevalence of VTE in 
chemotherapy-treated cancer patients. Methods: Studies on VTE occurrence in 
cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy were retrieved after database search. 
The terms used included ""cancer"", ""chemotherapy"", and ""venous thromboembolism"". 
A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to obtain a pooled estimate of VTE 
prevalence in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Results: A total of 102 
eligible studies involving 30,671 patients (1773 with VTE, 28,898 without) were 
included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of VTE prevalence was found 
to be 6%, ranging from 6% to 7% (ES 6%; 95% CI 6-7%; z = 18.53; p &lt; 0.001). 
Conclusions: The estimated pooled prevalence rate of VTEs was 6% in cancer 
patients undergoing CRT, which was higher than the overall crude prevalence rate 
(5.78%). Comprehensive cancer care should consider stratified VTE risk 
assessment based on cancer phenotype, given that certain phenotypes of cancer 
such as bladder, gastric and ovarian posing particularly high risks of VTE."
2023,"The poliovirus receptor (PVR) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig 
SF) and is essential for the promotion of cancer cell proliferation and 
invasion. However, the correlation between PVR expression and prognosis as well 
as immune infiltration in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The 
expression level of PVR was quantified using the Tumor and Tumor Immunity 
Evaluation Resource (TIMER) and Sangerbox. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database was used to validate the PVR expression. The receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the feasibility of using PVR as 
a differentiating factor according to the area under curve (AUC) score. A PVR 
binding protein network was built using the STRING tool. An enrichment analysis 
using the R package clusterProfiler was used to explore the potential function 
of PVR. Immune infiltration analysis was calculated with ESTIMATE algorithms. We 
also assessed the correlation between PVR expression and immune infiltration by 
the single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) method from the R 
package GSVA and TIMER database. The results showed that PVR was commonly 
overexpressed in multiple types of tumors including HCC. The data of GSE64041 
confirmed the same result. The ROC curve suggested that PVR could be a potential 
diagnostic biomarker. Additionally, high mRNA expression of PVR in HCC was 
significantly correlated with poor overall survival (OS) and relapse free 
survival (RFS). Results also indicated correlations between PVR mRNA expression 
with the level of infiltration immune cells including B cells, CD8+ T cells, 
cytotoxic cells, DCs, CD56dim NK cells, pDCs, and Th2 cells. Furthermore, the 
PVR level was significantly correlated with immune markers for immunosuppressive 
cells in HCC. In conclusion, PVR might be an important regulator of tumor immune 
cell infiltration and a valuable prognostic biomarker in HCC. However, 
additional work is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms."
2024,"Precise diagnosis of thyroid nodules is challenging due to 
non-diagnostic/inconclusive results and uncertainties about the malignancy of 
follicular neoplasms (FNs), even in frozen-section pathology. Therefore, 
surgical management, especially in Bethesda III and IV categories, may be 
complicated, and sometimes a second surgery may be required. The Thyroid Nodule 
Impedance Measurement System (TN-IMS) consists of a metallic patch attached to 
submental skin and a G20 I.V. cannula inserted into the targeted nodules. Two 
impedance-based parameters named Z1kHz and impedance phase slope (IPS) in 100 
kHz to 500 kHz of the thyroid nodules are recorded and compared with their 
histopathological results as the gold standard. TN-IMS was intra-surgically 
applied to 103 human thyroid nodules and normal thyroid tissues. A remarkable 
consistency between defined co-ranges of Z1kHz/IPS and the histopathological 
status of specimens was achieved (p &lt; 0.001). Based on these measurements, it 
was concluded that intraoperative bioelectrical impedance scanning of thyroid 
nodules would be a helpful complementary approach to detecting high-risk 
excision-required thyroid nodules."
2025,"INTRODUCTION: One of the most effective diagnostic tools for pancreatic cancer 
is endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) or biopsy 
(EUS-FNB). Several randomized clinical trials have compared different EUS tissue 
sampling needles for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-guided FNA as EUS-FNB 
needles for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer using a systematic review and 
meta-analysis.
METHOD: A literature review with a meta-analysis was performed according to the 
PRISMA guide. The databases of PubMed, Cochrane and Google Scholar were used, 
including studies published between 2011-2021 comparing the diagnostic yield 
(diagnostic accuracy or probability of positivity, sensitivity, specificity, 
predictive value) of EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. 
The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy. Random effect models allowed 
estimation of the pooled odds ratio with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%.
RESULTS: Nine randomized control trials were selected out of 5802 articles 
identified. Among these, five studies found no statistically significant 
difference between the EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB, whereas the other four did. The 
meta-analysis found EUS-FNB accuracy superior to EUS-FNA for the diagnosis of 
pancreatic cancer with a pooled odds ratio of 1.87 (IC 95%: 1.33-2.63).
CONCLUSION: As compared to EUS-FNA, EUS-FNB seems to improve diagnostic accuracy 
when applied to suspicious pancreatic lesions."
2026,"Lung cancer is considered one of the most fatal malignant neoplasms because of 
its late detection. Detecting molecular markers in samples from routine 
bronchoscopy, including many liquid-based cytology procedures, such as 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), could serve as a favorable technique to 
enhance the efficiency of a lung cancer diagnosis. BALF analysis is a promising 
approach to evaluating the tumor progression microenvironment. BALF's cellular 
and non-cellular components dictate the inflammatory response in a 
cancer-proliferating microenvironment. Furthermore, it is an essential material 
for detecting clinically significant predictive and prognostic biomarkers that 
may aid in guiding treatment choices and evaluating therapy-induced toxicities 
in lung cancer. In the present article, we have reviewed recent literature about 
the utility of BALF analysis for detecting markers in different stages of tumor 
cell metabolism, employing either specific biomarker assays or broader omics 
approaches."
2027,"Patients with endometrial cancer (EC) frequently have metastases to lungs, 
extra-pelvic nodes, and liver. Although an uncommon occurrence, cases of EC 
metastasis to bone, prevalently in vertebral bone, have also been reported. The 
objective of this study was to analyze clinical and pathological profiles of 
patients with EC metastatic to vertebral bone. We carried out a retrospective 
case series on surgically treated patients for this pathology. From 2001 to 
2021, out of 775 patients with bone metastasis, 1.6% had bone metastasis from 
EC. The median time between the diagnosis of primary tumor and that of bone 
metastases was 31.5 months. Solitary bone lesion was present in 7 patients and 
lumbar vertebrae were the segments most affected. Pathological fractures in 
46.2% of patients and spinal pain in all were present. In terms of location, 
46.2% of bone metastases resided within the anterior section of the vertebra, 
while the remaining presented an extension within the anterior and posterior 
sections, with 46.1% of cases showing an extradural extra-osseous extension and 
paraspinous envelope. Median survival after diagnosis of bone metastasis was 
11.5 months. Vertebral bone metastasis in EC is a rare phenomenon, with severe 
prognosis. An in-depth understanding of this topic may guide future management 
and treatment decisions, thus improving life expectancy and quality."
2028,"Among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in people are lung and colon 
cancers. They may develop concurrently in organs and negatively impact human 
life. If cancer is not diagnosed in its early stages, there is a great 
likelihood that it will spread to the two organs. The histopathological 
detection of such malignancies is one of the most crucial components of 
effective treatment. Although the process is lengthy and complex, deep learning 
(DL) techniques have made it feasible to complete it more quickly and 
accurately, enabling researchers to study a lot more patients in a short time 
period and for a lot less cost. Earlier studies relied on DL models that require 
great computational ability and resources. Most of them depended on individual 
DL models to extract features of high dimension or to perform diagnoses. 
However, in this study, a framework based on multiple lightweight DL models is 
proposed for the early detection of lung and colon cancers. The framework 
utilizes several transformation methods that perform feature reduction and 
provide a better representation of the data. In this context, histopathology 
scans are fed into the ShuffleNet, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet models. The number 
of deep features acquired from these models is subsequently reduced using 
principal component analysis (PCA) and fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FHWT) 
techniques. Following that, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to fuse the 
FWHT's reduced features obtained from the three DL models. Additionally, the 
three DL models' PCA features are concatenated. Finally, the diminished features 
as a result of PCA and FHWT-DWT reduction and fusion processes are fed to four 
distinct machine learning algorithms, reaching the highest accuracy of 99.6%. 
The results obtained using the proposed framework based on lightweight DL models 
show that it can distinguish lung and colon cancer variants with a lower number 
of features and less computational complexity compared to existing methods. They 
also prove that utilizing transformation methods to reduce features can offer a 
superior interpretation of the data, thus improving the diagnosis procedure."
2029,"Recent advancements in surgical and anti-cancer therapies have provided 
significant hope of long survival in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC). To 
realize this hope, routine medical checkups of asymptomatic people should be 
performed to identify operable PCs. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of 
medical checkups using abdominal ultrasonography (US). We retrospectively 
analyzed 374 patients with PC at our institute between 2010 and 2021. We divided 
these patients into several groups according to the diagnostic approach and 
compared their background and prognosis. These groups comprised PCs diagnosed 
through (a) symptoms, 242 cases; (b) US during medical checkup for asymptomatic 
individuals, 17; and other means. Of the 374 patients, 192 were men (51.3%), and 
the median age was 74 years (34-105). Tumors were located in the pancreatic tail 
in 67 patients (17.9%). Excision ratio and 5-year survival rate were 
significantly better in group (b) than in (a) (58.8% vs. 23.1%, p &lt; 0.01 and 
42.2% vs. 9.4%, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The prognosis of patients diagnosed 
using US during medical checkup was better than that of patients identified 
through symptomatic presentation of PC. US for asymptomatic individuals with PC 
might be one of the useful modalities for promoting better prognosis of PCs."
2030,"This study aims to analyze the sensitivity of vaginosonography (VGS) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative local evaluation of 
early-stage cervical cancers and to assess their accuracy in the detection of 
tumors, size of the lesions and stromal invasion by comparing them with the 
final histopathology report. This single-center study included 56 consecutive 
patients with cervical cancer who underwent VGS and MRI from November 2012 to 
January 2021. VGS significantly overestimated the lesion size by 2.7 mm (p = 
0.002), and MRI underestimated it by 1.9 mm (p = 0.11). Both MRI and VGS had a 
good concordance with the pathology report (Cohen's kappa of 0.73 and 0.81, 
respectively). However, MRI had a false-negative rate (38.1%) that was greater 
than VGS (0%) in cases of cervical tumor size &lt;2 cm. We found a good 
concordance between histology and VGS in the stromal infiltration assessment, 
with 89% sensitivity (95% CI 0.44-0.83) and 89% specificity (95% CI 0.52-0.86). 
VGS is a simple, inexpensive, widely available, and fast execution method that 
can complement ultrasound in particular cases and show a good correlation with 
MRI in the assessment of tumor dimensions, with a better performance in 
detecting small tumors (&lt;2 cm)."
2031,"Cervical cancer is regularly diagnosed in women all over the world. This cancer 
is the seventh most frequent cancer globally and the fourth most prevalent 
cancer among women. Automated and higher accuracy of cervical cancer 
classification methods are needed for the early diagnosis of cancer. In 
addition, this study has proved that routine Pap smears could enhance clinical 
outcomes by facilitating the early diagnosis of cervical cancer. Liquid-based 
cytology (LBC)/Pap smears for advanced cervical screening is a highly effective 
precancerous cell detection technology based on cell image analysis, where cells 
are classed as normal or abnormal. Computer-aided systems in medical imaging 
have benefited greatly from extraordinary developments in artificial 
intelligence (AI) technology. However, resource and computational cost 
constraints prevent the widespread use of AI-based automation-assisted cervical 
cancer screening systems. Hence, this paper reviewed the related studies that 
have been done by previous researchers related to the automation of cervical 
cancer classification based on machine learning. The objective of this study is 
to systematically review and analyses the current research on the classification 
of the cervical using machine learning. The literature that has been reviewed is 
indexed by Scopus and Web of Science. As a result, for the published paper 
access until October 2022, this study assessed past approaches for cervical cell 
classification based on machine learning applications."
2032,"Lung cancers are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Studies 
have shown that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which constitutes the 
majority of lung cancers, is significantly more responsive to early-stage 
interventions. However, the early stages are often asymptomatic, and current 
diagnostic methods are limited in their precision and safety. The cell-free RNAs 
(cfRNAs) circulating in plasma (liquid biopsies) offer a non-invasive detection 
of spatial and temporal changes occurring in primary tumors since the early 
stages. To address gaps in the current cfRNA knowledge base, we conducted a 
pilot study for the comprehensive analysis of transcriptome-wide changes in 
plasma cfRNA in NSCLC patients. Total cfRNA was extracted from archived plasma 
collected from NSCLC patients (N = 12), cancer-free former smokers (N = 12), and 
non-smoking healthy volunteers (N = 12). Plasma cfRNA expression levels were 
quantified by using a tagmentation-based library preparation and sequencing. The 
comparisons of cfRNA expression levels between patients and the two control 
groups revealed a total of 2357 differentially expressed cfRNAs enriched in 123 
pathways. Of these, 251 transcripts were previously reported in primary NSCLCs. 
A small subset of genes (N = 5) was validated in an independent sample (N = 50) 
using qRT-PCR. Our study provides a framework for developing blood-based assays 
for the early detection of NSCLC and warrants further validation."
2033,"Oral cancer is the 16th most common cancer worldwide. It commonly arises from 
painless white or red plaques within the oral cavity. Clinical outcome is highly 
related to the stage when diagnosed. However, early diagnosis is complex owing 
to the impracticality of biopsying every potentially premalignant intraoral 
lesion. Therefore, there is a need to develop a non-invasive cost-effective 
diagnostic technique to differentiate non-malignant and early-stage malignant 
lesions. Optical spectroscopy may provide an appropriate solution to facilitate 
early detection of these lesions. It has many advantages over traditional 
approaches including cost, speed, objectivity, sensitivity, painlessness, and 
ease-of use in clinical setting for real-time diagnosis. This review consists of 
a comprehensive overview of optical spectroscopy for oral cancer diagnosis, 
epidemiology, and recent improvements in this field for diagnostic purposes. It 
summarizes major developments in label-free optical spectroscopy, including 
Raman, fluorescence, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy during recent years. 
Among the wide range of optical techniques available, we chose these three for 
this review because they have the ability to provide biochemical information and 
show great potential for real-time deep-tissue point-based in vivo analysis. 
This review also highlights the importance of saliva-based potential biomarkers 
for non-invasive early-stage diagnosis. It concludes with the discussion on the 
scope of development and future demands from a clinical point of view."
2034,"Metabolic rewiring and defective immune responses are considered to be the main 
driving forces sustaining cell growth and oncogenesis in many cancers. The 
atypical enzyme, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), is 
produced by the liver in large amounts and plays a major role in lipid 
metabolism via the control of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and 
other cell surface receptors. In this context, many clinical studies have 
clearly demonstrated the high efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors in treating 
hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular diseases. Recent data implicated PCSK9 in the 
degradation of major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) receptors and the 
immune system as well as in other physiological activities. This review 
highlights the complex crosstalk between PCSK9, lipid metabolism and 
immunosuppression and underlines the latest advances in understanding the 
involvement of this convertase in other critical functions. We present a 
comprehensive assessment of the different strategies targeting PCSK9 and show 
how these approaches could be extended to future therapeutic options to treat 
cancers with a main focus on the liver."
2035,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to construct the ferritin autophagy regulatory network and 
illustrate its mechanism in ferroptosis, TME immunity and malignant phenotypes 
of ovarian cancer.
METHODS: First, we used Western blot assays and immunohistochemistry to detect 
the pathway expression in ovarian cancer samples (C-MYC, NCOA4). Then, we 
performed RIP and FISH analysis to verify the targeted binding of these factors 
after which we constructed ovarian cancer cell models and detected pathway 
regulator expression (NCOA4). Co-localization and Western blot assays were used 
to detect ferritin autophagy in different experimental groups. We selected 
corresponding kits to assess ROS contents in ovarian cancer cells. MMP was 
measured using flow cytometry and mitochondrial morphology was observed through 
TEM. Then, we chose Clone, EdU and Transwell to evaluate the proliferation and 
invasion abilities of ovarian cancer cells. We used Western blot assays to 
measure the DAMP content in ovarian cancer cell supernatants. Finally, we 
constructed tumor bearing models to study the effect of the C-MYC pathway on 
ovarian cancer tumorigenesis and TME immune infiltration in in vivo conditions.
RESULTS: Through pathway expression detection, we confirmed that C-MYC was 
obviously up-regulated and NCOA4 was obviously down-regulated in ovarian cancer 
samples, while their expression levels were closely related to the malignancy 
degree of ovarian cancer. RIP, FISH and cell model detection revealed that C-MYC 
could down-regulate NCOA4 expression through directly targeted binding with its 
mRNA. Ferritin autophagy and ferroptosis detection showed that C-MYC could 
inhibit ferroptosis through NCOA4-mediated ferritin autophagy, thus reducing ROS 
and inhibiting mitophagy in ovarian cancer cells. Cell function tests showed 
that C-MYC could promote the proliferation and invasion of ovarian cancer cells 
through the NCOA4 axis. The Western blot assay revealed that C-MYC could reduce 
HMGB1 release in ovarian cancer cells through the NCOA4 axis. In vivo 
experiments showed that C-MYC could promote tumorigenesis and immune evasion in 
ovarian cancer cells through inhibiting HMGB1 release induced by NCOA4-mediated 
ferroptosis.
CONCLUSION: According to these results, we concluded that C-MYC could 
down-regulate NCOA4 expression through directly targeted binding, thus 
inhibiting ferroptosis and promoting malignant phenotype/immune evasion in 
ovarian cancer cells through inhibiting ferritin autophagy."
2036,"Formerly hailed as ""undruggable"" proteins, transcription factors (TFs) are now 
under investigation for targeted therapy. In cancer, this may alter, inter alia, 
immune evasion or replicative immortality, which are implicated in genome 
organization, a process that accompanies multi-step tumorigenesis and which 
frequently develops in a non-random manner. Still, targeting-related research on 
some TFs is scarce, e.g., among AP-2 proteins, which are known for their altered 
functionality in cancer and prognostic importance. Using public repositories, 
bioinformatics tools, and RNA-seq data, the present study examined the 
ligandability of all AP-2 members, selecting the best one, which was 
investigated in terms of mutations, targets, co-activators, correlated genes, 
and impact on genome organization. AP-2 proteins were found to have the 
conserved ""TF_AP-2"" domain, but manifested different binding characteristics and 
evolution. Among them, AP-2δ has not only the highest number of 
post-translational modifications and extended strands but also contains a 
specific histidine-rich region and cleft that can receive a ligand. Uterine, 
colon, lung, and stomach tumors are most susceptible to AP-2δ mutations, which 
also co-depend with cancer hallmark genes and drug targets. Considering AP-2δ 
targets, some of them were located proximally in the spatial genome or served as 
co-factors of the genes regulated by AP-2δ. Correlation and functional analyses 
suggested that AP-2δ affects various processes, including genome organization, 
via its targets; this has been eventually verified in lung adenocarcinoma using 
expression and immunohistochemistry data of chromosomal conformation-related 
genes. In conclusion, AP-2δ affects chromosomal conformation and is the most 
appropriate target for cancer therapy focused on the AP-2 family."
2037,"To understand complex diseases, high-throughput data are generated at large and 
multiple levels. However, extracting meaningful information from large datasets 
for comprehensive understanding of cell phenotypes and disease pathophysiology 
remains a major challenge. Despite tremendous advances in understanding 
molecular mechanisms of cancer and its progression, current knowledge appears 
discrete and fragmented. In order to render this wealth of data more integrated 
and thus informative, we have developed a GECIP toolbox to investigate the 
crosstalk and the responsible genes'/proteins' connectivity of enriched pathways 
from gene expression data. To implement this toolbox, we used mainly gene 
expression datasets of prostate cancer, and the three datasets were GSE17951, 
GSE8218, and GSE1431. The raw samples were processed for normalization, 
prediction of differentially expressed genes, and the prediction of enriched 
pathways for the differentially expressed genes. The enriched pathways have been 
processed for crosstalk degree calculations for which number connections per 
gene, the frequency of genes in the pathways, sharing frequency, and the 
connectivity have been used. For network prediction, protein-protein interaction 
network database FunCoup2.0 was used, and cytoscape software was used for the 
network visualization. In our results, we found that there were enriched 
pathways 27, 45, and 22 for GSE17951, GSE8218, and GSE1431, respectively, and 11 
pathways in common between all of them. From the crosstalk results, we observe 
that focal adhesion and PI3K pathways, both experimentally proven central for 
cellular output upon perturbation of numerous individual/distinct signaling 
pathways, displayed highest crosstalk degree. Moreover, we also observe that 
there were more critical pathways which appear to be highly significant, and 
these pathways are HIF1a, hippo, AMPK, and Ras. In terms of the pathways' 
components, GSK3B, YWHAE, HIF1A, ATP1A3, and PRKCA are shared between the 
aforementioned pathways and have higher connectivity with the pathways and the 
other pathway components. Finally, we conclude that the focal adhesion and PI3K 
pathways are the most critical pathways, and since for many other pathways, 
high-rank enrichment did not translate to high crosstalk degree, the global 
impact of one pathway on others appears distinct from enrichment."
2038,"This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the impact of maternal oral 
inflammation on human milk composition including neutrophil counts, activation 
state (based on cluster of differentiation (CD) markers expression), and fatty 
acid levels. Fifty mothers were recruited from St. Michael's hospital, Toronto, 
and followed up from 2-4 weeks until 4 months postpartum. Oral rinse and human 
milk samples were collected at both timepoints. Oral polymorphonuclear 
neutrophils (oPMNs) within the rinses were quantified using flow cytometry and 
the participants' oral health state was categorized into three groups (i.e., 
healthy, moderate, and severe) based on the oPMNs counts. Fatty acids were 
identified and quantified using a gas chromatography-flame ionization detector 
(GC-FID). Compared to mothers with a healthy oral health state, mothers with 
moderate to severe oral inflammation had a statistically significant decrease in 
the expression of CD64 biomarker, an increase in the expression of CD14 
biomarker on human milk neutrophils and a decrease in the levels of 
eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3) in their human milk at follow-up compared to 
baseline. This study demonstrates for the first time that maternal oral 
inflammation can affect human milk composition. The mechanism by which these 
alterations can affect infant health outcomes in the long term critically needs 
to be considered."
2039,"Treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) remains very challenging, and it is particularly 
important to find sensitive and specific molecular targets. In this work, we 
reveal the relationship between the expression of cathepsins and radioresistance 
in GBM. We analyzed cathepsins (cathepsin B, cathepsin D, cathepsin L, and 
cathepsin Z/X), which are highly associated with the radioresistance of GBM by 
regulating different types of cell death. Cathepsins could be potential targets 
for GBM treatment."
2040,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are important immune cells in the tumor 
microenvironment (TME). Previous studies have shown that TAMs play a dual role 
in the development of colorectal cancer and promote the additional exploration 
of the immune escape of colorectal cancer. Studies have confirmed that 
macrophages utilize amino acid metabolism under the stimulation of some factors 
released by tumor cells, thus affecting the direction of polarization. 
Therefore, we investigated the effect of amino acid metabolism on macrophage 
function and the involved mechanism. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the 
GSE18804 GEO dataset and amino acid metabolism pathway, we identified the eight 
key enzymes of amino acid metabolism in colon TAMs, namely, ACADM, ACADS, GPX4, 
GSR, HADH, HMGCL, HMGCS1 and IDH1. We then evaluated the expression, survival 
analysis and relationship of clinicopathological features with these eight key 
enzymes. The results supported the critical role of these eight genes in 
colorectal cancer. Macrophages phagocytose tumor cells, and these eight key 
enzymes were identified in combination with GPX4, a critical protein of 
ferroptosis, suggesting that the change in the expression of these eight key 
enzymes in TAMs may be involved in the regulation of colorectal cancer through 
cell death. Correlation analysis of three programmed cell death (PCD) marker 
genes indicated that these eight key enzymes may cause macrophage death through 
pyroptosis, leading to immune escape of colorectal cancer. We also investigated 
the regulation of ACADS in CRC using flow cytometry, qPCR and ELISAs, which 
demonstrated that an ACADS deficiency polarizes TAMs to M2 macrophages. In 
summary, the present study revealed the relationship between amino acid 
metabolism and the cell death of macrophages, providing a new research direction 
for the molecular mechanism of macrophage polarization."
2041,"Aberrant expression of the oncoprotein c-Myc (Myc) is frequently observed in 
solid tumors and is associated with reduced overall survival. In addition to 
well-recognized cancer cell-intrinsic roles of Myc, studies have also suggested 
tumor-promoting roles for Myc in cells of the tumor microenvironment, including 
macrophages and other myeloid cells. Here, we benchmark Myc inactivation in 
tumor cells against the contribution of its expression in myeloid cells of 
murine hosts that harbor endogenous or allograft tumors. Surprisingly, we 
observe that LysMCre-mediated Myc ablation in host macrophages does not 
attenuate tumor growth regardless of immunogenicity, the cellular origin of the 
tumor, the site it develops, or the stage along the tumor progression cascade. 
Likewise, we find no evidence for Myc ablation to revert or antagonize the 
polarization of alternatively activated immunosuppressive macrophages. Thus, we 
surmise that systemic targeting of Myc activity may confer therapeutic benefits 
primarily through limiting Myc activity in tumor cells rather than 
reinvigorating the anti-tumor activity of macrophages."
2042,"The endocannabinoid system has been shown to be involved in various skin 
functions, such as melanogenesis and the maintenance of redox balance in skin 
cells exposed to UV radiation, as well as barrier functions, sebaceous gland 
activity, wound healing and the skin's immune response. In addition to the 
potential use of cannabinoids in the treatment and prevention of skin cancer, 
cannabinoid compounds and derivatives are of interest as potential systemic and 
topical applications for the treatment of various inflammatory, fibrotic and 
pruritic skin conditions. In this context, cannabinoid compounds have been 
successfully tested as a therapeutic option for the treatment of androgenetic 
alopecia, atopic and seborrhoeic dermatitis, dermatomyositis, asteatotic and 
atopic eczema, uraemic pruritis, scalp psoriasis, systemic sclerosis and venous 
leg ulcers. This review provides an insight into the current literature on 
cannabinoid compounds as potential medicines for the treatment of skin diseases."
2043,"Kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK)6 is associated with inflammatory diseases and 
neoplastic progression. KLK6 is aberrantly expressed in several solid tumors and 
regulates cancer development, metastatic progression, and drug resistance. 
However, the function of KLK6 in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. 
This study aimed to determine the role of KLK6 in the tumor microenvironment. 
Here, we uncovered the mechanism underlying KLK6-mediated cross-talk between 
cancer cells and macrophages. Compared with wild-type mice, KLK6-/- mice showed 
less tumor growth and metastasis in the B16F10 melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma 
(LLC) xenograft model. Mechanistically, KLK6 promoted the secretion of tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) from macrophages via the activation of 
protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) in an autocrine manner. TNF-α secreted from 
macrophages induced the release of the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1) 
from melanoma and lung carcinoma cells in a paracrine manner. The introduction 
of recombinant KLK6 protein in KLK6-/- mice rescued the production of TNF-α and 
CXCL1, tumor growth, and metastasis. Inhibition of PAR1 activity suppressed 
these malignant phenotypes rescued by rKLK6 in vitro and in vivo. Our findings 
suggest that KLK6 functions as an important molecular link between macrophages 
and cancer cells during malignant progression, thereby providing opportunities 
for therapeutic intervention."
2044,"To improve the efficacy of trastuzumab, it is essential to understand its 
mechanism of action. One of the significant issues that makes it difficult to 
determine the precise mechanism of trastuzumab action is the formation of 
various HER receptor dimers in HER2-positive breast cancer cells. So far, 
studies have focused on the role of HER2-HER3 heterodimers, and little is known 
regarding EGFR-HER2 heterodimers. Here, we study the role of trastuzumab on the 
cell signaling and cell proliferation mediated by EGFR-HER2 heterodimers in 
BT474 and SRBR3 cells. EGF stimulates the formation of both EGFR homodimer and 
EGFR-HER2 heterodimer. Trastuzumab only binds to HER2, not EGFR. Therefore, any 
effects of trastuzumab on EGF-induced activation of EGFR, HER2, and downstream 
signaling proteins, as well as cell proliferation, are through its effects on 
EGFR-HER2 heterodimers. We show that trastuzumab inhibits EGF-induced cell 
proliferation and cell cycle progression in BT474 and SKBR3 cells. Interestingly 
trastuzumab strongly inhibits EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation and slightly 
inhibits EGF-induced Erk activation, in both BT474 and SKBR3 cells. These data 
suggest the presence of a novel mechanism that allows trastuzumab to inhibit 
EGR-induced Akt activation and cell proliferation, without blocking EGF-induced 
EGFR-HER2 heterodimerization and activation. We show that trastuzumab inhibits 
EGF-induced lipid raft localization of the EGFR-HER2 heterodimer. Disruption of 
the lipid raft with MβCD blocks HER2-mediated AKT activation in a similar way to 
trastuzumab. MβCD and trastuzumab synergically inhibit AKT activation. We 
conclude that trastuzumab inhibits EGF-induced lipid raft localization of 
EGFR-HER2 heterodimer, which leads to the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and 
cell proliferation, without blocking the formation and phosphorylation of the 
EGFR-HER2 heterodimer."
2045,"Periodontitis is significantly associated with the risk of cancers in the lung 
and the digestive system. Emerging evidence shows a plausible link between 
periodontitis and several types of brain diseases. However, the association 
between periodontal infection and glioma remains unclear. In the cultured GL261 
glioma cells, P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly promoted cell 
proliferation at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 ng/mL. It promoted cell 
migration at a higher concentration (100 and 1000 ng/mL). Additionally, exposure 
to 100 ng/mL P. gingivalis LPS induced a significant increase in the expression 
of TNF-α, TGF-β, MMP2, and MMP9, as well as the phosphorylation level of Akt at 
Ser473. These changes induced by P. gingivalis LPS were significantly 
antagonized by the Akt inhibitor. Furthermore, a total of 48 patients with brain 
tumors were enrolled to investigate their periodontal status before receiving 
tumor management. Poor periodontal status [probing depth (PD) ≥ 6 mm and 
attachment loss (AL) &gt;5 mm] was found in 42.9% (9/21) of patients with 
glioma, which was significantly higher than that in patients with benign tumors 
and the relevant data in the 4th National Oral Health Survey in China. The 
glioma patients with both AL &gt; 5 mm and PD ≥ 6 mm had a higher ki-67 labeling 
index than those with AL ≤ 5 mm or PD &lt; 6 mm. These findings support the 
association between periodontal infection and glioma progression."
2046,"Diabetes-associated bone complications lead to fragile bone mechanical strength 
and osteoporosis, aggravating the disease burden of patients. Advanced evidence 
shows that chronic hyperglycemia and metabolic intermediates, such as 
inflammatory factor, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and advanced glycation end 
products (AGEs), are regarded as dominant hazardous factors of bone 
complications, whereas the pathophysiological mechanisms are complex and 
controversial. By establishing a diabetic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model and 
diabetic bone loss cell model in vitro, we confirmed that diabetes impaired 
primary cilia and led to bone loss, while adding Icariin (ICA) could relieve the 
inhibitions. Mechanistically, ICA could scavenge ROS to maintain the 
mitochondrial and primary cilia homeostasis of osteoblasts. Intact primary cilia 
acted as anchoring and modifying sites of Gli2, thereby activating the primary 
cilia/Gli2/osteocalcin signaling pathway to promote osteoblast differentiation. 
All results suggest that ICA has potential as a therapeutic drug targeting bone 
loss induced by diabetes."
2047,"Gut microbiota is thought to influence host responses to allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT). Recent evidence points to this 
post-transplant for acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD). We asked whether 
any such association might be found pre-transplant and conducted a 
metagenome-wide association study (MWAS) to explore. Microbial abundance 
profiles were estimated using ensembles of Kaiju, Kraken2, and DeepMicrobes 
calls followed by dimensionality reduction. The area under the curve (AUC) was 
used to evaluate classification of the samples (aGvHD vs. none) using an elastic 
net to test the relevance of metagenomic data. Clinical data included the 
underlying disease (leukemia vs. other hematological malignancies), recipient 
age, and sex. Among 172 aHSCT patients of whom 42 developed aGVHD post 
transplantation, a total of 181 pre-transplant tool samples were analyzed. The 
top performing model predicting risk of aGVHD included a reduced species profile 
(AUC = 0.672). Beta diversity (37% in Jaccard's Nestedness by mean fold change, 
p &lt; 0.05) was lower in those developing aGvHD. Ten bacterial species 
including Prevotella and Eggerthella genera were consistently found to associate 
with aGvHD in indicator species analysis, as well as relief and impurity-based 
algorithms. The findings support the hypothesis on potential associations 
between gut microbiota and aGvHD based on a data-driven approach to MWAS. This 
highlights the need and relevance of routine stool collection for the discovery 
of novel biomarkers."
2048,"Myc, a member of the ""Myc Network"" of bHLH-ZIP transcription factors, supervises 
proliferation, metabolism, and translation. It also engages in crosstalk with 
the related ""Mlx Network"" to co-regulate overlapping genes and functions. We 
investigated the consequences of stepwise conditional inactivation of Myc and 
Mlx in primary and SV40 T-antigen-immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts 
(MEFs). Myc-knockout (MycKO) and Myc × Mlx ""double KO"" (DKO)-but not 
MlxKO-primary MEFs showed rapid growth arrest and displayed features of 
accelerated aging and senescence. However, DKO MEFs soon resumed proliferating, 
indicating that durable growth arrest requires an intact Mlx network. All three 
KO MEF groups deregulated multiple genes and functions pertaining to aging, 
senescence, and DNA damage recognition/repair. Immortalized KO MEFs proliferated 
in Myc's absence while demonstrating variable degrees of widespread genomic 
instability and sensitivity to genotoxic agents. Finally, compared to primary 
MycKO MEFs, DKO MEFs selectively downregulated numerous gene sets associated 
with the p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) pathways and G2/M arrest. Thus, the 
reversal of primary MycKO MEF growth arrest by either Mlx loss or SV40 T-antigen 
immortalization appears to involve inactivation of the p53 and/or Rb pathways."
2049,"CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is efficacious for 
refractory/relapsed (R/R) B-cell hematological malignancies, yet relapse due to 
CD19 antigen escape remains a challenge. Our trial explored simultaneous 
targeting of multiple B-cell antigens as a therapeutic approach that may reduce 
the risk of relapse. We tested the safety and efficacy of CAR19/22 T-cell 
cocktail therapy including murinized and humanized products among patients with 
R/R aggressive B-cell lymphoma. In the group that received the humanized 
product, 11/12 (91.7%) patients achieved an objective response, including 9/12 
(75%) complete responses (CRs) by day 28. The overall response rate and CR rate 
in the murinized group was 92.9% (13/14) and 42.9% (6/14), respectively. Nine of 
12 (75%) patients in the humanized group maintained CR at month 3 following 
infusion, compared to 5/14 patients (35.7%) in the murinized group. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was more favorable in the humanized compared to 
the murinized group. Most patients had mild cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
(grade 1-2) in both groups. This study demonstrates that CAR19/22 T-cell 
cocktail therapy is safe and effective for R/R B-cell lymphoma and that patients 
treated with a humanized CAR-T exhibited better efficacy compared to patients 
treated with a murinized CAR-T therapy."
2050,"BACKGROUND: In a previous report, we have identified the cannabinoid receptor 2 
(CB2) agonist HU308 to possess a beneficial effect in preventing age and 
trauma-induced osteoarthritis (OA) in mice. The effects of HU308 were largely 
related to the capacity of this compound to induce cartilage anabolism which was 
dependent on the CREB/SOX9 axis, and exhibited pro-survival and 
pro-proliferative hallmarks of articular cartilage following treatment. Here, we 
utilized the novel cannabinoid-fenchone CB2 agonists (1B, 1D), which were 
previously reported to render anti-inflammatory effects in a zymosan model.
METHODS: Initially, we assessed the selectivity of CB2 using a Gs-protein 
receptor cAMP potency assay, which was also validated for antagonistic effects 
dependent on the Gi-protein receptor cAMP pathway. Based on EC50 values, 1D was 
selected for a zymosan inflammatory pain model. Next, 1D was administered in two 
doses intra-articularly (IA), in a post-traumatic medial meniscal tear (MMT, 
Lewis rats) model, and compared to sham, vehicle, and a positive control 
consisting of fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) administration. The 
histopathological assessment was carried out according to the Osteoarthritis 
Research Society International (OARSI) guidelines for rat models following 28 
days post-MMT.
RESULTS: The G protein receptor assays confirmed that both 1B and 1D possess CB2 
agonistic effects in cell lines and in chondrocytes. Co-administering a CB2 
antagonists to 25 mg/kg 1D in a paw inflammatory pain model abolished 1D-related 
anti-swelling effect and partially abolishing its analgesic effects. Using an 
MMT model, the high dose (i.e., 24 µg) of 1D administered via IA route, 
exhibited reduced cartilage damage. Particularly, this dose of 1D exhibited a 
30% improvement in cartilage degeneration (zonal/total tibial scores) and lesion 
depth ratios (44%), comparable to the FGF18 positive control. Synovitis scores 
remained unaffected and histopathologic evaluation of subchondral bone damage 
did not suggest that 1D treatment changed the load-bearing ability of the rats. 
Contrary to the anabolic effect of FGF18, synovial inflammation was observed and 
was accompanied by increased osteophyte size.
CONCLUSION: The structural histopathological analysis supports a 
disease-modifying effect of IA-administered 1D compound without any deleterious 
effects on the joint structure."
2051,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, thus the search for new 
cancer therapies is of utmost importance. Ursolic acid is a naturally occurring 
pentacyclic triterpene with a wide range of pharmacological activities including 
anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic effects. The latter has been assigned to 
its ability to promote apoptosis and inhibit cancer cell proliferation by poorly 
defined mechanisms. In this report, we identify lysosomes as the essential 
targets of the anti-cancer activity of ursolic acid. The treatment of MCF7 
breast cancer cells with ursolic acid elevates lysosomal pH, alters the cellular 
lipid profile, and causes lysosomal membrane permeabilization and leakage of 
lysosomal enzymes into the cytosol. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization precedes 
the essential hallmarks of apoptosis placing it as an initial event in the 
cascade of effects induced by ursolic acid. The disruption of the lysosomal 
function impairs the autophagic pathway and likely partakes in the mechanism by 
which ursolic acid kills cancer cells. Furthermore, we find that combining 
treatment with ursolic acid and cationic amphiphilic drugs can significantly 
enhance the degree of lysosomal membrane permeabilization and cell death in 
breast cancer cells."
2052,"Prostate cancer bone metastasis is still one of the most fatal cancer diagnoses 
for men. Survival of the circulating prostate tumor cells and their adaptation 
strategy to survive in the bone niche is the key point to determining metastasis 
in early cancer stages. The promoter of SFRP2 gene, encoding a WNT signaling 
modulator, is hypermethylated in many cancer types including prostate cancer. 
Moreover, SFRP2 can positively regulate osteogenic differentiation in vitro and 
in vivo. Here, we showed SFRP2 overexpression in the prostate cancer cell line 
PC3 induces an epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), increases the 
attachment, and modifies the transcriptome towards an osteoblast-like phenotype 
(osteomimicry) in a collagen 1-dependent manner. Our data reflect a novel 
molecular mechanism concerning how metastasizing prostate cancer cells might 
increase their chance to survive within bone tissue."
2053,"A study by Tsvetkov et al. recently published a proposed novel form of 
copper-induced cell death in Science; however, few studies have looked into the 
possible mechanism in soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Herein, this study sought to 
investigate the function of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in the development 
of tumor-associated immune cells and the prognosis of sarcoma. Herein, this 
study aimed to explore the role of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in the 
development, tumor-associated immune cells, and the prognosis of sarcoma.
METHODS: The prognostic model was established via the least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm as well as multivariate Cox regression 
analysis. The stromal scores, immune scores, ESTIMA scores, and tumor purity of 
sarcoma patients were evaluated by the ESTIMATE algorithm. Functional analyses 
were performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of immune cell 
infiltration and the prognosis of CRGs in sarcoma.
RESULTS: Two molecular subgroups with different CRG expression patterns were 
recognized, which showed that patients with a higher immune score and more 
active immune status were prone to have better prognostic survival. Moreover, GO 
and KEGG analyses showed that these differentially expressed CRGs were mainly 
enriched in metabolic/ions-related signaling pathways, indicating that CRGs may 
have impacts on the immune cell infiltration and prognosis of sarcoma via 
regulating the bioprocess of mitochondria and consequently affecting the immune 
microenvironment. The expression levels of CRGs were closely correlated to the 
immunity condition and prognostic survival of sarcoma patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The interaction between cuproptosis and immunity in sarcoma may 
provide a novel insight into the study of molecular mechanisms and candidate 
biomarkers for the prognosis, resulting in effective treatments for sarcoma 
patients."
2054,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignancy that seriously threatens human health, 
and metastasis from CRC is a major cause of death and poor prognosis for 
patients. Studying the potential mechanisms of small extracellular vesicles 
(sEVs) in tumor development may provide new options for early and effective 
diagnosis and treatment of CRC metastasis. In this review, we systematically 
describe how sEVs mediate epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), reconfigure 
the tumor microenvironment (TME), modulate the immune system, and alter vascular 
permeability and angiogenesis to promote CRC metastasis. We also discuss the 
current difficulties in studying sEVs and propose new ideas."
2055,"Cells employ several adaptive mechanisms under conditions of accelerated cell 
division, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is composed of a 
tripartite signaling system that involves ATF6, PERK, and IRE1, which maintain 
protein homeostasis (proteostasis). However, deregulation of protein translation 
initiation could be associated with breast cancer (BC) chemoresistance. 
Specifically, eukaryotic initiation factor-4A (eIF4A) is involved in the 
unfolding of the secondary structures of several mRNAs at the 5' untranslated 
region (5'-UTR), as well as in the regulation of targets involved in 
chemoresistance. Importantly, the tumor suppressor gene PDCD4 could modulate 
this process. This regulation might be disrupted in chemoresistant triple 
negative-BC (TNBC) cells. Therefore, we characterized the effect of doxorubicin 
(Dox), a commonly used anthracycline medication, on human breast carcinoma 
MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, we generated and characterized models of Dox 
chemoresistance, and chemoresistant cells exhibited lower Dox internalization 
levels followed by alteration of the IRE1 and PERK arms of the UPR and 
triggering of the antioxidant Nrf2 axis. Critically, chemoresistant cells 
exhibited PDCD4 downregulation, which coincided with a reduction in eIF4A 
interaction, suggesting a sophisticated regulation of protein translation. 
Likewise, Dox-induced chemoresistance was associated with alterations in 
cellular migration and invasion, which are key cancer hallmarks, coupled with 
changes in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation and secretion of matrix 
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Moreover, eIF4A knockdown via siRNA and its 
overexpression in chemoresistant cells suggested that eIF4A regulates FAK. 
Pro-atherogenic low-density lipoproteins (LDL) promoted cellular invasion in 
parental and chemoresistant cells in an MMP-9-dependent manner. Moreover, Dox 
only inhibited parental cell invasion. Significantly, chemoresistance was 
modulated by cryptotanshinone (Cry), a natural terpene purified from the roots 
of Salvia brandegeei. Cry and Dox co-exposure induced chemosensitization, 
connected with the Cry effect on eIF4A interaction. We further demonstrated the 
Cry binding capability on eIF4A and in silico assays suggest Cry inhibition on 
the RNA-processing domain. Therefore, strategic disruption of protein 
translation initiation is a druggable pathway by natural compounds during 
chemoresistance in TNBC. However, plasmatic LDL levels should be closely 
monitored throughout treatment."
2056,"Cancer patients undergoing paclitaxel infusion usually experience peripheral 
nerve degeneration and serious neuropathic pain termed paclitaxel-induced 
peripheral neuropathy (PIPN). However, alterations in the dose or treatment 
schedule for paclitaxel do not eliminate PIPN, and no therapies are available 
for PIPN, despite numerous studies to uncover the mechanisms underlying the 
development/maintenance of this condition. Therefore, we aimed to uncover a 
novel mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of PIPN. Clinical studies suggest 
that acute over excitation of primary sensory neurons is linked to the 
pathogenesis of PIPN. We found that paclitaxel-induced acute hyperexcitability 
of primary sensory neurons results from the paclitaxel-induced inhibition of 
KCNQ potassium channels (mainly KCNQ2), found abundantly in sensory neurons and 
axons. We found that repeated application of XE-991, a specific KCNQ channel 
blocker, induced PIPN-like alterations in rats, including mechanical 
hypersensitivity and degeneration of peripheral nerves, as detected by both 
morphological and behavioral assays. In contrast, genetic deletion of KCNQ2 from 
peripheral sensory neurons in mice significantly attenuated the development of 
paclitaxel-induced peripheral sensory fiber degeneration and chronic pain. These 
findings may lead to a better understanding of the causes of PIPN and provide an 
impetus for developing new classes of KCNQ activators for its therapeutic 
treatment."
2057,"HeberFERON, a co-formulation of Interferon (IFN)-α2b and IFN-γ, has effects on 
skin cancer and other solid tumors. It has antiproliferative effects over 
glioblastoma multiform (GBM) clones and cultured cell lines, including U-87 MG. 
Here, we report the first label-free quantitative proteomic and 
phospho-proteomic analyses to evaluate changes induced by HeberFERON after 72 h 
incubation of U-87 MG that can explain the effect on cellular proliferation. 
LC-MS/MS, functional enrichment and networking analysis were performed. We 
identified 7627 proteins; 122 and 211 were down- and up-regulated by HeberFERON 
(fold change &gt; 2; p &lt; 0.05), respectively. We identified 23,549 peptides 
(5692 proteins) and 8900 phospho-peptides; 523 of these phospho-peptides (359 
proteins) were differentially modified. Proteomic enrichment showed IFN 
signaling and its control, direct and indirect antiviral mechanisms were the 
main modulated processes. Phospho-proteome enrichment displayed the cell cycle 
as one of the most commonly targeted events together with cytoskeleton 
organization; translation/RNA splicing, autophagy and DNA repair, as represented 
biological processes. There is a high interconnection of phosphoproteins in a 
molecular network; mTOR occupies a centric hub with interactions with 
translation machinery, cytoskeleton and autophagy components. Novel phosphosites 
and others with unknown biological functionality in key players in the 
aforementioned processes were regulated by HeberFERON and involved CDK and ERK 
kinases. These findings open new experimental hypotheses regarding HeberFERON 
action. The results obtained contribute to a better understanding of HeberFERON 
effector mechanisms in the context of GBM treatment."
2058,"The mammalian STE 20-like protein kinase 4 (MST4) gene is highly expressed in 
several cancer types, but little is known about the role of MST4 in breast 
cancer, and the function of MST4 during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
has not been fully elucidated. Here we report that overexpression of MST4 in 
breast cancer results in enhanced cell growth, migration, and invasion, whereas 
inhibition of MST4 expression significantly attenuates these properties. Further 
study shows that MST4 promotes EMT by activating Akt and its downstream 
signaling molecules such as E-cadherin/N-cadherin, Snail, and Slug. MST4 also 
activates AKT and its downstream pro-survival pathway. Furthermore, by analyzing 
breast cancer patient tissue microarray and silicon datasets, we found that MST4 
expression is much higher in breast tumor tissue compared to normal tissue, and 
significantly correlates with cancer stage, lymph node metastasis and a poor 
overall survival rate (p &lt; 0.05). Taken together, our findings demonstrate 
the oncogenic potential of MST4 in breast cancer, highlighting its role in 
cancer cell proliferation, migration/invasion, survival, and EMT, suggesting a 
possibility that MST4 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer."
2059,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a brain tumor notorious for its propensity to 
recur after the standard treatments of surgical resection, ionizing radiation 
(IR), and temozolomide (TMZ). Combined with the acquired resistance to standard 
treatments and recurrence, GBM is an especially deadly malignancy with hardly 
any worthwhile treatment options. The treatment resistance of GBM is influenced, 
in large part, by the contributions from two main degradative pathways in 
eukaryotic cells: ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. These two 
systems influence GBM cell survival by removing and recycling cellular 
components that have been damaged by treatments, as well as by modulating 
metabolism and selective degradation of components of cell survival or cell 
death pathways. There has recently been a large amount of interest in potential 
cancer therapies involving modulation of UPS or autophagy pathways. There is 
significant crosstalk between the two systems that pose therapeutic challenges, 
including utilization of ubiquitin signaling, the degradation of components of 
one system by the other, and compensatory activation of autophagy in the case of 
proteasome inhibition for GBM cell survival and proliferation. There are several 
important regulatory nodes which have functions affecting both systems. There 
are various molecular components at the intersections of UPS and autophagy 
pathways that pose challenges but also show some new therapeutic opportunities 
for GBM. This review article aims to provide an overview of the recent 
advancements in research regarding the intersections of UPS and autophagy with 
relevance to finding novel GBM treatment opportunities, especially for combating 
GBM treatment resistance."
2060,"Cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, is defined as irreversible cell cycle 
arrest in response to various stimuli. It plays both beneficial and detrimental 
roles in cellular homeostasis and diseases. Quality control (QC) is important 
for the proper maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The QC machineries regulate 
the integrity of RNA and protein by repairing or degrading them, and are 
dysregulated during cellular senescence. QC dysfunction also contributes to 
multiple age-related diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative, muscle, 
and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we describe the characters of 
cellular senescence, discuss the major mechanisms of RNA and protein QC in 
cellular senescence and aging, and comprehensively describe the involvement of 
these QC machineries in age-related diseases. There are many open questions 
regarding RNA and protein QC in cellular senescence and aging. We believe that a 
better understanding of these topics could propel the development of new 
strategies for addressing age-related diseases."

2063,"Clonal heterogeneity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) forms the basis for 
treatment failure and relapse. Attempts to decipher clonal evolution and clonal 
competition primarily depend on deep sequencing approaches. However, this 
prevents the experimental confirmation of the identified disease-relevant traits 
on the same cell material. Here, we describe the development and application of 
a complex fluorescent genetic barcoding (cFGB) lentiviral vector system for the 
labeling and subsequent multiplex tracking of up to 48 viable AML clones by flow 
cytometry. This approach allowed the visualization of longitudinal changes in 
the in vitro growth behavior of multiplexed color-coded AML clones for up to 137 
days. Functional studies of flow cytometry-enriched clones documented their 
stably inherited increase in competitiveness, despite the absence of 
growth-promoting mutations in exome sequencing data. Transplantation of aliquots 
of a color-coded AML cell mix into mice revealed the initial engraftment of 
similar clones and their subsequent differential distribution in the animals 
over time. Targeted RNA-sequencing of paired pre-malignant and de novo expanded 
clones linked gene sets associated with Myc-targets, embryonic stem cells, and 
RAS signaling to the foundation of clonal expansion. These results demonstrate 
the potency of cFGB-mediated clonal tracking for the deconvolution of verifiable 
driver-mechanisms underlying clonal selection in leukemia."
2064,"The gene changes for diagnosis and prognosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) still remain unclear. RAC1 was reported to be asso;ciated with the B 
cell receptor signal pathway, but its relations with DLBCL have not yet been 
systematically explored. In this study, we have conducted molecular, 
bioinformatics and clinical analyses by using publicly available data from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Wilcoxon signed-rank test and logistic regression 
were performed to evaluate the association between RAC1 and clinical features in 
patients. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used to examine the 
impacts of RAC1 expression level on overall survival, and a nomogram was 
performed to illustrate the correlation between RAC1 and the risk of DLBCL. Our 
results revealed that the expression level of RAC1 in DLBCL was higher than that 
in normal tissues or lymphadenitis. High-level expression of RAC1 was 
significantly associated with clinical stage, as well as being an independent 
factor affecting overall survival. RAC1 was negatively correlated with Bruton's 
tyrosine kinase (BTK). The association between RAC1 gene expression and the risk 
of DLBCL was presented in a nomogram. In conclusion, RAC1 expression patterns 
may be used to predict the development and prognosis of DLBCL."
2065,"Lung cancer is the most common cancer with high morbidity and mortality 
worldwide. Our previous studies showed that fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2) is 
highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and plays a vital role in the 
tumorigenesis of LUAD. However, the underlying mechanism is not fully 
understood. Autophagy has recently attracted increasing attention due to its 
pro-survival role in cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we found that FUT2 
was up-regulated and had an AUC (Area Under Curve) value of 0.964 in lung 
adenocarcinoma based on the TCGA dataset. Knockdown of FUT2 weakened the 
autophagy response, as evidenced by a degradation of LC3-II and Beclin1. The 
phosphorylation levels of AMPK, ULK1, and PI3K III were significantly reduced by 
FUT2 knockdown. FUT2 promoted the translocation of p53 from the cytoplasm into 
the nucleus, which triggered the DRAM1 pathway and enhanced autophagy. 
Meanwhile, the knockdown of FUT2 increased the phosphorylation of JNK and 
promoted mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, the knockdown of FUT2 
inhibited the autophagy induced by Z-VAD-FMK and promoted the apoptosis 
suppressed by rapamycin. The autophagy and apoptosis regulated by FUT2 
antagonized each other. Taken together, these findings provide a mechanistic 
understanding of how FUT2 mediated the crosstalk between autophagy and 
apoptosis, which determine lung cancer cell death and survival, leading to the 
progression of lung adenocarcinoma."
2066,"Exposure to artificial radio frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) has 
greatly increased in recent years, thus promoting a growing scientific and 
social interest in deepening the biological impact of EMFs on living organisms. 
The current legislation governing the exposure to RF-EMFs is based exclusively 
on their thermal effects, without considering the possible non-thermal adverse 
health effects from long term exposure to EMFs. In this study we investigated 
the biological non-thermal effects of low-level indoor exposure to RF-EMFs 
produced by WiFi wireless technologies, using Drosophila melanogaster as the 
model system. Flies were exposed to 2.4 GHz radiofrequency in a Transverse 
Electromagnetic (TEM) cell device to ensure homogenous controlled fields. 
Signals were continuously monitored during the experiments and regulated at non 
thermal levels. The results of this study demonstrate that WiFi electromagnetic 
radiation causes extensive heterochromatin decondensation and thus a general 
loss of transposable elements epigenetic silencing in both germinal and neural 
tissues. Moreover, our findings provide evidence that WiFi related 
radiofrequency electromagnetic fields can induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
accumulation, genomic instability, and behavioural abnormalities. Finally, we 
demonstrate that WiFi radiation can synergize with RasV12 to drive tumor 
progression and invasion. All together, these data indicate that radiofrequency 
radiation emitted from WiFi devices could exert genotoxic effects in Drosophila 
and set the stage to further explore the biological effects of WiFi 
electromagnetic radiation on living organisms."
2067,"In advanced metastatic cancers with reduced patient survival and poor prognosis, 
expression of vimentin, a type III intermediate filament protein is frequently 
observed. Vimentin appears to suppress epithelial characteristics and augments 
cell migration but the molecular basis for these changes is not well understood. 
Here, we have ectopically expressed vimentin in MCF-7 and investigated its 
genomic and functional implications. Vimentin changed the cell shape by 
decreasing major axis, major axis angle and increased cell migration, without 
affecting proliferation. Vimentin downregulated major keratin genes KRT8, KRT18 
and KRT19. Transcriptome-coupled GO and KEGG analyses revealed that 
vimentin-affected genes were linked to either cell-cell/cell-ECM or cell 
cycle/proliferation specific pathways. Using shRNA mediated knockdown of 
vimentin in two cell types; MCF-7FV (ectopically expressing) and MDA-MB-231 
(endogenously expressing), we identified a vimentin-specific signature 
consisting of 13 protein encoding genes (CDH5, AXL, PTPRM, TGFBI, CDH10, NES, 
E2F1, FOXM1, CDC45, FSD1, BCL2, KIF26A and WISP2) and two long non-coding RNAs, 
LINC00052 and C15ORF9-AS1. CDH5, an endothelial cadherin, which mediates 
cell-cell junctions, was the most downregulated protein encoding gene. 
Interestingly, downregulation of CDH5 by shRNA significantly increased cell 
migration confirming our RNA-Seq data. Furthermore, presence of vimentin altered 
the lamin expression in MCF-7. Collectively, we demonstrate, for the first time, 
that vimentin in breast cancer cells could change nuclear architecture by 
affecting lamin expression, which downregulates genes maintaining cell-cell 
junctions resulting in increased cell migration."
2068,"Boron neutron capture therapy is a low-invasive cancer therapy based on the 
neutron fission process that occurs upon thermal neutron irradiation of 
10B-containing compounds; this process causes the release of alpha particles 
that selectively damage cancer cells. Although several clinical studies 
involving mercaptoundecahydro-closo-dodecaborate and the 
boronophenylalanine-fructose complex are currently ongoing, the success of this 
promising anticancer therapy is hampered by the lack of appropriate drug 
delivery systems to selectively carry therapeutic concentrations of boron atoms 
to cancer tissues, allowing prolonged boron retention therein and avoiding the 
damage of healthy tissues. To achieve these goals, numerous research groups have 
explored the possibility to formulate nanoparticulate systems for boron 
delivery. In this review. we report the newest developments on boron 
vehiculating drug delivery systems based on nanoparticles, distinguished on the 
basis of the type of carrier used, with a specific focus on the formulation 
aspects."
2069,"Cancer progression is supported by the cross-talk between tumor cells and the 
surrounding stroma. In this context, senescent cells in the tumor 
microenvironment contribute to the development of a pro-inflammatory milieu and 
the acquisition of aggressive traits by cancer cells. Anticancer treatments 
induce cellular senescence (therapy-induced senescence, TIS) in both tumor and 
non-cancerous cells, contributing to many detrimental side effects of therapies. 
Thus, we focused on the effects of chemotherapy on the stromal compartment of 
prostate and ovarian cancer. We demonstrated that anticancer chemotherapeutics, 
regardless of their specific mechanism of action, promote a senescent phenotype 
in stromal fibroblasts, resulting in metabolic alterations and secretion of 
paracrine factors, sustaining the invasive and clonogenic potential of both 
prostate and ovarian cancer cells. The clearance of senescent stromal cells, 
through senolytic drug treatment, reverts the malignant phenotype of tumor 
cells. The clinical relevance of TIS was validated in ovarian and prostate 
cancer patients, highlighting increased accumulation of lipofuscin aggregates, a 
marker of the senescent phenotype, in the stromal compartment of tissues from 
chemotherapy-treated patients. These data provide new insights into the 
potential efficacy of combining traditional anticancer strategies with 
innovative senotherapy to potentiate anticancer treatments and overcome the 
adverse effects of chemotherapy."
2070,"B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) is an immune checkpoint molecule that 
mediates the escape of tumor cells from immunosurveillance. Consequently, BTLA 
and its ligand herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) are potentially 
immunotherapeutic targets. However, the potential effects of BTLA on tumor cells 
remain incompletely unknown. Here, we show that BTLA is expressed across a broad 
range of tumor cells. The depletion of BTLA or HVEM promotes cell proliferation 
and colony formation, which is reversed by the overexpression of BTLA in BTLA 
knockout cells. In contrast, overexpression of BTLA or HVEM inhibits tumor cell 
proliferation and colony formation. Furthermore, the proliferation of a 
subpopulation with high BTLA was also significantly slower than that of the low 
BTLA subpopulation. Mechanistically, the coordination of BTLA and HVEM inhibits 
its major downstream extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) signaling 
pathway, thus preventing tumor cell growth. This study demonstrates that tumor 
cell-intrinsic BTLA/HVEM is a potential tumor suppressor and is likely to have a 
potential antagonist for immunotherapy, thus representing a potential biomarker 
for the optimal cancer immunotherapeutic treatment."
2071,"The fatal clinical course of human glioblastoma (GBM) despite aggressive 
adjuvant therapies is due to high rates of recurrent tumor growth driven by 
tumor cells with stem-cell characteristics (glioma stem cells, GSCs). The 
aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) family of enzymes has been shown to be a 
biomarker for GSCs, and ALDH1 seems to be involved in the biological processes 
causing therapy resistance. Ferroptosis is a recently discovered cell death 
mechanism, that depends on iron overload and lipid peroxidation, and it could, 
therefore, be a potential therapeutic target in various cancer types. Since both 
ALDH1 and ferroptosis interact with lipid peroxidation (LPO), we aimed to 
investigate a possible connection between ALDH1 and ferroptosis. Here, we show 
that RSL3-induced LPO and ferroptotic cell death revealed RSL3-sensitive and 
-resistant malignant glioma cell lines. Most interestingly, RSL3 sensitivity 
correlates with ALDH1a3 expression; only high ALDH1a3-expressing cells seem to 
be sensitive to ferroptosis induction. In accordance, inhibition of ALDH1a3 
enzymatic activity by chemical inhibition or genetic knockout protects tumor 
cells from RSL3-induced ferroptotic cell death. Both RSL-3-dependent binding of 
ALDH1a3 to LC3B and autophagic downregulation of ferritin could be completely 
blocked by ALDH inhibition. Therefore, ALDH1a3 seems to be involved in 
ferroptosis through the essential release of iron by ferritinophagy. Our results 
also indicate that ferroptosis induction might be a particularly interesting 
clinical approach for targeting the highly aggressive cell population of GSC."
2072,"The one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) method allows for the 
quantitative evaluation of the tumor burden in resected lymph nodes (LNs) in 
patients with lung cancer. This technique enables to detect macro and 
micrometastases, facilitating the correct classification of patients for 
appropriate follow-up of the disease after surgery. Of 160 patients with 
resectable lung cancer whose LNs were examined by OSNA, H&E and CK19 IHC between 
July 2015 and December 2018, 110 patients with clinical stages from IA1 to IIIB 
were selected for follow-up. LN staging in lung cancer by pathological study led 
to understaging in 13.64% of the cases studied. OSNA allowed to quantify the 
tumor burden and establish a prognostic value. Patients with a total tumor load 
of ≥1650 cCP/uL were associated with a significantly increased likelihood of 
recurrence. Moreover, the survival of patients with &lt;4405 cCP/uL was 
significantly higher than patients with ≥4405 cCP/uL. The OSNA assay is a rapid 
and accurate technique for quantifying the tumor burden in the LNs of lung 
cancer patients and OSNA quantitative data could allow to establish prognostic 
values for recurrence-free survival and overall survival in this type of 
malignancy."
2073,"Ciliated cell markers expressed in epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC) are 
associated with improved survival. We examined the distribution of cells 
expressing ciliated cell markers in various EOC histologies and stages. 
Immunohistochemistry and/or multiplex immunofluorescence were used to determine 
the expression of FOXJ1 and/or CAPS (ciliated cell markers) in tissue 
microarrays including 4 normal fallopian tubes, 6 normal endometria, 16 
cystadenomas, 25 borderline tumors, 21 low-grade carcinomas, and 118 high-grade 
carcinomas (HGSOC) (46 serous, 29 endometrioid, 30 clear cell, 13 mucinous). 
CAPS+ cells were observed in normal fallopian tubes and endometria and in ~85% 
of serous benign and borderline tumors and low-grade carcinomas but only in 
&lt;40% of HGSOC. mRNA data from an independent cohort showed higher FOXJ1 and 
CAPS expression in serous borderline tumors and low-grade carcinomas compared to 
HGSOC. In HGSOC, ciliated cell-positive markers were observed in 52% primary 
tumors compared to 26% of patient-matched synchronous metastases, and 24% 
metachronous metastases (p = 0.009). mRNA data from an independent HGSOC cohort 
showed lower levels of CAPS in metastases than in primary tumors (p = 0.03). 
Overall, the study revealed that ciliated cells were less common in mucinous 
EOC, the percentage of ciliated cell marker-positive cases decreased with 
increasing grade, and the percentage of ciliated cells decreased in HGSOC 
metastases compared to patient-matched primary tumors."
2074,"Insulin resistance onset in skeletal muscle is characterized by the impairment 
of insulin signaling, which reduces the internalization of glucose, known as 
glucose uptake, into the cell. Therefore, there is a deficit of intracellular 
glucose, which is the main source for energy production in the cell. This may 
compromise cellular viability and functions, leading to pathological 
dysfunction. Skeletal muscle fibers continuously generate reactive oxygen and 
nitrogen species (RONS). An excess of RONS produces oxidative distress, which 
may evoke cellular damage and dysfunction. However, a moderate level of RONS, 
which is called oxidative eustress, is critical to maintain, modulate and 
regulate cellular functions through reversible interactions between RONS and the 
components of cellular signaling pathways that control those functions, such as 
the facilitation of glucose uptake. The skeletal muscle releases peptides called 
myokines that may have endocrine and paracrine effects. Some myokines bind to 
specific receptors in skeletal muscle fibers and might interact with cellular 
signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt and AMPK, and facilitate glucose uptake. In 
addition, there are cytokines, which are peptides produced by non-skeletal 
muscle cells, that bind to receptors at the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle 
cells and interact with the cellular signaling pathways, facilitating glucose 
uptake. RONS, myokines and cytokines might be acting on the same signaling 
pathways that facilitate glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. However, the 
experimental studies are limited and scarce. The aim of this review is to 
highlight the current knowledge regarding the role of RONS, myokines and 
cytokines as potential signals that facilitate glucose uptake in skeletal 
muscle. In addition, we encourage researchers in the field to lead and undertake 
investigations to uncover the fundamentals of glucose uptake evoked by RONS, 
myokines, and cytokines."
2075,"The vertebrate immune system functions to eliminate invading foreign nucleic 
acids and foreign proteins from infectious diseases and malignant tumors. 
Because pathogens and cancer cells have unique amino acid sequences and motifs 
(e.g., microbe-associated molecular patterns, MAMPs) that are recognized as 
""non-self"" to the host, immune enhancement is one strategy to eliminate invading 
cells. MAMPs contain nucleic acids specific or characteristic of the microbe and 
are potential candidates for immunostimulants or adjuvants. Adjuvants are 
included in many vaccines and are a way to boost immunity by deliberately 
administering them along with antigens. Although adjuvants are an important 
component of vaccines, it is difficult to evaluate their efficacy ex vivo and in 
vivo on their own (without antigens). In addition, inflammation induced by 
currently candidate adjuvants may cause adverse events, which is a hurdle to 
their approval as drugs. In addition, the lack of guidelines for evaluating the 
safety and efficacy of adjuvants in drug discovery research also makes 
regulatory approval difficult. Viral double-stranded (ds) RNA mimics have been 
reported as potent adjuvants, but the safety barrier remains unresolved. Here we 
present ARNAX, a noninflammatory nucleic acid adjuvant that selectively targets 
Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in antigen-presenting dendritic cells (APCs) to 
safely induce antigen cross-presentation and subsequently induce an acquired 
immune response independent of inflammation. This review discusses the 
challenges faced in the clinical development of novel adjuvants."
2076,"OBJECTIVE: Glioma is the most common primary malignancy of the adult central 
nervous system (CNS), with a poor prognosis and no effective prognostic 
signature. Since late 2019, the world has been affected by the rapid spread of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Research on SARS-CoV-2 is flourishing; however, its 
potential mechanistic association with glioma has rarely been reported. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the potential correlation of SARS-CoV-2-related 
genes with the occurrence, progression, prognosis, and immunotherapy of gliomas.
METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-related genes were obtained from the human protein atlas 
(HPA), while transcriptional data and clinicopathological data were obtained 
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) 
databases. Glioma samples were collected from surgeries with the knowledge of 
patients. Differentially expressed genes were then identified and screened, and 
seven SARS-CoV-2 related genes were generated by LASSO regression analysis and 
uni/multi-variate COX analysis. A prognostic SARS-CoV-2-related gene signature 
(SCRGS) was then constructed based on these seven genes and validated in the 
TCGA validation cohort and CGGA cohort. Next, a nomogram was established by 
combining critical clinicopathological data. The correlation between SCRGS and 
glioma related biological processes was clarified by Gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA). In addition, immune infiltration and immune score, as well as 
immune checkpoint expression and immune escape, were further analyzed to assess 
the role of SCRGS in glioma-associated immune landscape and the responsiveness 
of immunotherapy. Finally, the reliability of SCRGS was verified by quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on glioma samples.
RESULTS: The prognostic SCRGS contained seven genes, REEP6, CEP112, LARP4B, 
CWC27, GOLGA2, ATP6AP1, and ERO1B. Patients were divided into high- and low-risk 
groups according to the median SARS-CoV-2 Index. Overall survival was 
significantly worse in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. COX 
analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated 
excellent predictive power for SCRGS for glioma prognosis. In addition, GSEA, 
immune infiltration, and immune scores indicated that SCRGS could potentially 
predict the tumor microenvironment, immune infiltration, and immune response in 
glioma patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The SCRGS established here can effectively predict the prognosis of 
glioma patients and provide a potential direction for immunotherapy."
2077,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been used in recent years as a non-invasive 
treatment for cancer, due to the side effects of traditional treatments such as 
surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. This therapeutic technique requires a 
photosensitizer, light energy, and oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) which mediate cellular toxicity. PDT is a useful non-invasive therapy for 
cancer treatment, but it has some limitations that need to be overcome, such as 
low-light-penetration depths, non-targeting photosensitizers, and tumor hypoxia. 
This review focuses on the latest innovative strategies based on the synergistic 
use of other energy sources, such as non-visible radiation of the 
electromagnetic spectrum (microwaves, infrared, and X-rays), ultrasound, and 
electric/magnetic fields, to overcome PDT limitations and enhance the 
therapeutic effect of PDT. The main principles, mechanisms, and crucial elements 
of PDT are also addressed."
2078,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible cellular program that 
transiently places epithelial (E) cells into pseudo-mesenchymal (M) cell states. 
The malignant progression and resistance of many carcinomas depend on EMT 
activation, partial EMT, or hybrid E/M status in neoplastic cells. EMT is 
activated by tumor microenvironmental TGFβ signal and EMT-inducing transcription 
factors, such as ZEB1/2, in tumor cells. However, reverse EMT factors are less 
studied. We demonstrate that prostate epithelial transcription factor SCAND1 can 
reverse the cancer cell mesenchymal and hybrid E/M phenotypes to a more 
epithelial, less invasive status and inhibit their proliferation and migration 
in DU-145 prostate cancer cells. SCAND1 is a SCAN domain-containing protein and 
hetero-oligomerizes with SCAN-zinc finger transcription factors, such as MZF1, 
for accessing DNA and the transcriptional co-repression of target genes. We 
found that SCAND1 expression correlated with maintaining epithelial features, 
whereas the loss of SCAND1 was associated with mesenchymal phenotypes of tumor 
cells. SCAND1 and MZF1 were mutually inducible and coordinately included in 
chromatin with hetero-chromatin protein HP1γ. The overexpression of SCAND1 
reversed hybrid E/M status into an epithelial phenotype with E-cadherin and 
β-catenin relocation. Consistently, the co-expression analysis in TCGA PanCancer 
Atlas revealed that SCAND1 and MZF1 expression was negatively correlated with 
EMT driver genes, including CTNNB1, ZEB1, ZEB2 and TGFBRs, in prostate 
adenocarcinoma specimens. In addition, SCAND1 overexpression suppressed tumor 
cell proliferation by reducing the MAP3K-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Of note, in 
a mouse tumor xenograft model, SCAND1 overexpression significantly reduced 
Ki-67(+) and Vimentin(+) tumor cells and inhibited migration and lymph node 
metastasis of prostate cancer. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed high expression of 
SCAND1 and MZF1 to correlate with better prognoses in pancreatic cancer and head 
and neck cancers, although with poorer prognosis in kidney cancer. Overall, 
these data suggest that SCAND1 induces expression and coordinated 
heterochromatin-binding of MZF1 to reverse the hybrid E/M status into an 
epithelial phenotype and, inhibits tumor cell proliferation, migration, and 
metastasis, potentially by repressing the gene expression of EMT drivers and the 
MAP3K-MEK-ERK signaling pathway."
2079,"Oil production waste products (OPWPs) derive from olive mill and represent a 
crucial environmental problem due to their high polyphenolic content able to 
pollute the ground. One option to reduce the OPWPs' environmental impact is to 
exploit polyphenols' biological properties. We sought to analyze the 
transcriptomic variations of colorectal cancer cells exposed to the OPWPs 
extracts and hydroxytyrosol, the major component, to recognize unknown and 
ill-defined characteristics. Among the top affected pathways identified by GSEA, 
we focused on oxidative phosphorylation in an in vitro system. Colorectal cancer 
HCT116 and LoVo cells treated with hydroxytyrosol or OPWPs extracts showed 
enhancement of the respiratory chain complexes' protein levels, ATP production 
and membrane potential, suggesting stimulation of mitochondrial functions. The 
major proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and fusion events of 
mitochondrial dynamics were positively affected, as by Western blot, fostering 
increase of the mitochondrial mass organized in a network of elongated 
organelles. Mechanistically, we proved that PPARγ mediates the effects as they 
are mimicked by a specific ligand and impaired by a specific inhibitor. OPWP 
extracts and hydroxytyrosol, thus, promote mitochondrial functionality via a 
feed-forward regulatory loop involving the PPARγ/PGC-1α axis. These results 
support their use in functional foods and as adjuvants in cancer therapy."
2080,"Cancer immunotherapy has now entered clinical practice and has reshaped the 
standard of care for many cancer patients. With these new strategies, specific 
toxicities have emerged, and renal side effects have been described. In this 
review, we will describe the causes of acute kidney injury in CAR T cell, immune 
checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer immuno-therapy recipients. CAR T cell 
therapy and bispecific T cell engaging antibodies can lead to acute kidney 
injury as a consequence of cytokine release syndrome, tumor lysis syndrome, 
sepsis or specific CAR T cell infiltration. Immune checkpoint blockade most 
often results in acute tubular interstitial nephritis, but glomerular diseases 
have also been described. Although the pathophysiology remains mostly elusive, 
we will describe the mechanisms of renal damage in these contexts, its prognosis 
and treatment. As the place of immunotherapy in the anti-cancer armamentarium is 
exponentially increasing, close collaboration between nephrologists and 
oncologists is of utmost importance to provide the best standard of care for 
these patients."
2081,"Mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux by NCLX is a critical rate-limiting step in 
mitochondria signaling. We previously showed that NCLX is phosphorylated at a 
putative Casein Kinase 2 (CKII) site, the serine 271 (S271). Here, we asked if 
NCLX is regulated by CKII and interrogated the physiological implications of 
this control. We found that CKII inhibitors down-regulated NCLX-dependent Ca2+ 
transport activity in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells and primary hippocampal neurons. 
Furthermore, we show that the CKII phosphomimetic mutants on NCLX inhibited 
(S271A) and constitutively activated (S271D) NCLX transport, respectively, 
rendering it insensitive to CKII inhibition. These phosphomimetic NCLX mutations 
also control the allosteric regulation of NCLX by mitochondrial membrane 
potential (ΔΨm). Since the omnipresent CKII is necessary for modulating the 
plasticity of the axon initial segment (AIS), we interrogated, in hippocampal 
neurons, if NCLX is required for this process. Similarly to WT neurons, NCLX-KO 
neurons can exhibit homeostatic plasticity following M-channel block. However, 
while WT neurons utilize a CKII-sensitive distal relocation of AIS Na+ and Kv7 
channels to decrease their intrinsic excitability, we did not observe such 
translocation in NCLX-KO neurons. Thus, our results indicate that NCLX is 
regulated by CKII and is a crucial link between CKII signaling and fast neuronal 
plasticity."
2082,"The roles of lamin A/C in adipocyte differentiation and skeletal muscle lipid 
metabolism are associated with familial partial lipodystrophy of Dunnigan 
(FPLD). We confirmed that LMNA knockdown (KD) in mouse adipose-derived 
mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) prevented adipocyte maturation. Importantly, in 
in vitro experiments, we discovered a significant increase in phosphorylated 
lamin A/C levels at serine 22 or 392 sites (pLamin A/C-S22/392) accompanying 
increased lipid synthesis in a liver cell line (7701 cells) and two 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines (HepG2 and MHCC97-H cells). Moreover, 
HCC cells did not survive after LMNA knockout (KO) or even KD. Evidently, the 
functions of lamin A/C differ between the liver and adipose tissue. To date, the 
mechanism of hepatocyte lipid metabolism mediated by nuclear lamin A/C remains 
unclear. Our in-depth study aimed to identify the molecular connection between 
lamin A/C and pLamin A/C, hepatic lipid metabolism and liver cancer. Gain- and 
loss-of-function experiments were performed to investigate functional changes 
and the related molecular pathways in 7701 cells. Adenosine 5' 
monophosphate-activated protein kinase α (AMPKα) was activated when 
abnormalities in functional lamin A/C were observed following lamin A/C 
depletion or farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) treatment. Active AMPKα 
directly phosphorylated acetyl-CoA-carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and subsequently 
inhibited lipid synthesis but induced glycolysis in both HCC cells and normal 
cells. According to the mass spectrometry analysis, lamin A/C potentially 
regulated AMPKα activation through its chaperone proteins, ATPase or ADP/ATP 
transporter 2. Lonafarnib (an FTI) combined with low-glucose conditions 
significantly decreased the proliferation of the two HCC cell lines more 
efficiently than lonafarnib alone by inhibiting glycolysis or the maturation of 
prelamin A."
2083,"MicroRNA (miRNA)-disease association (MDA) prediction is critical for disease 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Traditional MDA wet experiments, on the 
other hand, are inefficient and costly.Therefore, we proposed a multi-layer 
collaborative unsupervised training base model called SGAEMDA (Stacked Graph 
Autoencoder-Based Prediction of Potential miRNA-Disease Associations). First, 
from the original miRNA and disease data, we defined two types of initial 
features: similarity features and association features. Second, stacked graph 
autoencoder is then used to learn unsupervised low-dimensional representations 
of meaningful higher-order similarity features, and we concatenate the 
association features with the learned low-dimensional representations to obtain 
the final miRNA-disease pair features. Finally, we used a multilayer perceptron 
(MLP) to predict scores for unknown miRNA-disease associations. SGAEMDA achieved 
a mean area under the ROC curve of 0.9585 and 0.9516 in 5-fold and 10-fold 
cross-validation, which is significantly higher than the other baseline methods. 
Furthermore, case studies have shown that SGAEMDA can accurately predict 
candidate miRNAs for brain, breast, colon, and kidney neoplasms."
2084,"Bile acid (BA) synthesis from cholesterol by hepatocytes is inhibited by 
inflammatory cytokines. Whether liver inflammation also affects BA side chain 
shortening and conjugation was investigated. In human liver cell lines (IHH, 
HepG2, and HepaRG), agonists of nuclear receptors including the farnesoid X 
receptor (FXR), liver X receptor (LXR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptors (PPARs) did not affect the expression of BA-related peroxisomal 
enzymes. In contrast, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) inhibition 
down-regulated acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (ACOX2). ACOX2 was repressed by fibroblast 
growth factor 19 (FGF19), which was prevented by extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase (ERK) pathway inhibition. These changes were paralleled by altered BA 
synthesis (HPLC-MS/MS). Cytokines able to down-regulate 
cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) had little effect on peroxisomal enzymes 
involved in BA synthesis except for ACOX2 and bile acid-CoA:amino acid 
N-acyltransferase (BAAT), which were down-regulated, mainly by oncostatin M 
(OSM). This effect was prevented by Janus kinase (JAK) inhibition, which 
restored BA side chain shortening and conjugation. The binding of OSM to the 
extracellular matrix accounted for a persistent effect after culture medium 
replacement. In silico analysis of four databases (n = 201) and a validation 
cohort (n = 90) revealed an inverse relationship between liver inflammation and 
ACOX2/BAAT expression which was associated with changes in HNF4α levels. In 
conclusion, BA side chain shortening and conjugation are inhibited by 
inflammatory effectors. However, other mechanisms involved in BA homeostasis 
counterbalance any significant impact on the serum BA profile."
2085,"Current treatments for lower-grade glioma (LGG) do not effectively improve life 
expectancy rates, and this is a major global health concern. Improving our 
knowledge of this disease will ultimately help to improve prevention, accurate 
prognosis, and treatment strategies. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of 
regulated cell death, which plays an important role in tumor progression and 
occurrence. There is still a lack of effective markers to evaluate the prognosis 
of LGG patients. We collected paraffin-embedded tissue samples and prognostic 
information from 85 patients with low-grade gliomas and fabricated them into a 
tissue microarray. Combining data from public databases, we explored the 
relationship between pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) and the prognoses of 
patients with LGG and investigated their correlations with the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) by means of machine learning, single-cell, 
immunohistochemical, nomogram, GSEA, and Cox regression analyses. We developed a 
six-gene PRG-based prognostic model, and the results have identified CASP4 as an 
effective marker for LGG prognosis predictions. Furthermore, the effects on 
immune cell infiltration may also provide guidance for future immunotherapy 
strategies."
2086,"The plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells is composed of a large number of lipid 
species that are laterally segregated into functional domains as well as 
asymmetrically distributed between the outer and inner leaflets. Additionally, 
the spatial distribution and organization of these lipids dramatically change in 
response to various cellular states, such as cell division, differentiation, and 
apoptosis. Division of one cell into two daughter cells is one of the most 
fundamental requirements for the sustenance of growth in all living organisms. 
The successful completion of cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division, is 
critically dependent on the spatial distribution and organization of specific 
lipids. In this review, we discuss the properties of various lipid species 
associated with cytokinesis and the mechanisms involved in their polarization, 
including forward trafficking, endocytic recycling, local synthesis, and 
cortical flow models. The differences in lipid species requirements and 
distribution in mitotic vs. male meiotic cells will be discussed. We will 
concentrate on sphingolipids and phosphatidylinositols because their 
transbilayer organization and movement may be linked via the cytoskeleton and 
thus critically regulate various steps of cytokinesis."
2087,"Historical standard of care treatments of T-cell malignancies generally entailed 
the use of cytotoxic and depleting approaches. These strategies are, however, 
poorly validated and record dismal long-term outcomes. More recently, the 
introduction and approval of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has 
revolutionized the therapy of B-cell malignancies. Translating this success to 
the T-cell compartment has so far proven hazardous, entangled by risks of 
fratricide, T-cell aplasia, and product contamination by malignant cells. 
Several strategies have been utilized to overcome these challenges. These 
include the targeting of a selective cognate antigen exclusive to T-cells or a 
subset of T-cells, disruption of target antigen expression on CAR-T constructs, 
use of safety switches, non-viral transduction, and the introduction of 
allogeneic compounds and gene editing technologies. We herein overview these 
historical challenges and revisit the opportunities provided as potential 
solutions. An in-depth understanding of the tumor microenvironment is required 
to optimally harness the potential of the immune system to treat T-cell 
malignancies."
2088,"The Myc Network, comprising a small assemblage of bHLH-ZIP transcription 
factors, regulates many hundreds to thousands of genes involved in 
proliferation, energy metabolism, translation and other activities. A 
structurally and functionally related set of factors known as the Mlx Network 
also supervises some of these same functions via the regulation of a more 
limited but overlapping transcriptional repertoire. Target gene co-regulation by 
these two Networks is the result of their sharing of three members that suppress 
target gene expression as well as by the ability of both Network's members to 
cross-bind one another's consensus DNA sites. The two Networks also differ in 
that the Mlx Network's control over transcription is positively regulated by 
several glycolytic pathway intermediates and other metabolites. These 
distinctive properties, functions and tissue expression patterns potentially 
allow for sensitive control of gene regulation in ways that are differentially 
responsive to environmental and metabolic cues while allowing for them to be 
both rapid and of limited duration. This review explores how such control might 
occur. It further discusses how the actual functional dependencies of the Myc 
and Mlx Networks rely upon cellular context and how they may differ between 
normal and neoplastic cells. Finally, consideration is given to how future 
studies may permit a more refined understanding of the functional 
interrelationships between the two Networks."
2089,"Non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Abl plays a role in the pathogenesis of several 
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. 
Here, we found that TDP-43, which was one of the main proteins comprising 
pathological deposits in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a novel 
substrate for c-Abl. The phosphorylation of tyrosine 43 of TDP-43 by c-Abl led 
to increased TDP-43 levels in the cytoplasm and increased the formation of 
G3BP1-positive stress granules in SH-SY5Y cells. The kinase-dead mutant of c-Abl 
had no effect on the cytoplasmic localization of TDP-43. The expression of 
phosphor-mimetic mutant Y43E of TDP-43 in primary cortical neurons accumulated 
the neurite granule. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of TDP-43 at tyrosine 43 
by c-Abl promoted the aggregation of TDP-43 and increased neuronal cell death in 
primary cortical neurons, but not in c-Abl-deficient primary cortical neurons. 
Identification of c-Abl as the kinase of TDP43 provides new insight into the 
pathogenesis of ALS."
2090,"Artificial intelligence (AI), a field of research in which computers are applied 
to mimic humans, is continuously expanding and influencing many aspects of our 
lives. From electric cars to search motors, AI helps us manage our daily lives 
by simplifying functions and activities that would be more complex otherwise. 
Even in the medical field, and specifically in oncology, many studies in recent 
years have highlighted the possible helping role that AI could play in clinical 
and therapeutic patient management. In specific contexts, clinical decisions are 
supported by ""intelligent"" machines and the development of specific softwares 
that assist the specialist in the management of the oncology patient. Melanoma, 
a highly heterogeneous disease influenced by several genetic and environmental 
factors, to date is still difficult to manage clinically in its advanced stages. 
Therapies often fail, due to the establishment of intrinsic or secondary 
resistance, making clinical decisions complex. In this sense, although much work 
still needs to be conducted, numerous evidence shows that AI (through the 
processing of large available data) could positively influence the management of 
the patient with advanced melanoma, helping the clinician in the most favorable 
therapeutic choice and avoiding unnecessary treatments that are sure to fail. In 
this review, the most recent applications of AI in melanoma will be described, 
focusing especially on the possible finding of this field in the management of 
drug treatments."
2091,"Liver diseases are responsible for global mortality and morbidity and are a 
significant cause of death worldwide. Consequently, the advancement of new liver 
disease targets is of great interest. Non-coding RNA (ncRNA), such as microRNA 
(miRNA) and long ncRNA (lncRNA), has been proven to play a significant role in 
the pathogenesis of virtually all acute and chronic liver disorders. Recent 
studies demonstrated the medical applications of miRNA in various phases of 
hepatic pathology. PPARs play a major role in regulating many signaling pathways 
involved in various metabolic disorders. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) is the most prevalent form of chronic liver disease in the world, 
encompassing a spectrum spanning from mild steatosis to severe non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH). PPARs were found to be one of the major regulators in 
the progression of NAFLD. There is no recognized treatment for NAFLD, even 
though numerous clinical trials are now underway. NAFLD is a major risk factor 
for developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and its frequency increases as 
obesity and diabetes become more prevalent. Reprogramming anti-diabetic and 
anti-obesity drugs is an effective therapy option for NAFLD and NASH. Several 
studies have also focused on the role of ncRNAs in the pathophysiology of NAFLD. 
The regulatory effects of these ncRNAs make them a primary target for treatments 
and as early biomarkers. In this study, the main focus will be to understand the 
regulation of PPARs through ncRNAs and their role in NAFLD."
2092,"(1) Background: Both sepsis acute lung injury (SALI) and non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) are life-threatening diseases caused by immune response disorders 
and inflammation, but the underlining linking mechanisms are still not clear. 
This study aimed to detect the shared gene signature and potential molecular 
process between SALI and NSCLC. (2) Methods: RNA sequences and patient 
information on sepsis and NSCLC were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to 
build a co-expression network associated with sepsis and NSCLC. Protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) analysis of shared genes was intuitively performed by the 
Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database. 
The involvement of EZH2 in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and sepsis 
immune microenvironment (IME) was assessed by R software. Western blot, flow 
cytometry, and other in vitro assays were performed to further confirm the 
function and mechanism of EZH2 in NSCLC and SALI. (3) Results: WGCNA recognized 
three major modules for sepsis and two major modules for NSCLC, and there were 
seven shared genes identified for the two diseases. Additionally, the hub gene 
EZH2 was screened out. It was shown that EZH2 was closely related to the IME in 
the two diseases. In the validation assay, our data showed that EZH2 was 
expressed at a higher level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 
septic patients than those of healthy donors (HDs), and EZH2 was also expressed 
at a higher level in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PBMCs and non-small cell 
lung cancer (A549) cells. EZH2 inhibitor (GSK343) downregulated the 
proliferation ability of A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, 
parallel with the decreased expression level of PD-L1. Similarly, GSK343 
inhibited PD-L1 protein expression and downregulated the level of 
proinflammatory factors in LPS-induced PBMCs. In the co-culture system of PBMCs 
and human type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATIIs), the addition of GSK343 to 
PBMCs significantly downregulated the apoptosis of LPS-induced ATIIs. (4) 
Conclusions: This study illustrated that EZH2 inhibition could ameliorate A549 
cell proliferation and LPS-induced ATII apoptosis in parallel with 
downregulation of PD-L1 protein expression, which provided new insights into 
molecular signaling networks involved in the pathogenetics of SALI and NSCLC."
2093,"Gamma-ray irradiation is an effective and clean method of sterilization by 
inactivating microorganisms. It can also be applied to induce anti-oxidants for 
future application. In this study, the mung bean (Vigna radiata) was exposed to 
gamma-ray irradiation under the dose of 0, 5 or 10 kGy. With increasing 
irradiation doses, the concentrations of malondiadehyde decreased while the 
levels of total flavonoids and DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical 
scavenging activity increased. It has been shown that consuming flavonoids can 
provide protective effects. In addition, proteomic analysis identified several 
proteins having anti-oxidant activities in the 5 kGy irradiated group. These 
proteins are Apocytochrome f, Systemin receptor SR 160, DELLA protein DWARF8, 
DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase 9, ζ-carotene desaturase (ZDS), and Floral 
homeotic protein AGAMOUS. Our findings indicate that plants contain a variety of 
phytochemicals and antioxidant proteins which may effectively prevent oxidative 
stress caused by irradiated peroxidation."
2094,"Urtica dioica (UD) is a multi-functional plant known to be used as both food and 
medicine from ancient times. The plant has the potential to be used as a 
fertilizer and for biological pest control. It is also used in textile and 
related industries for its quality fibers. In the recent past, the plant has 
received great attention for its numerous important biological activities and 
food applications. The antioxidant activity of UD is the crucial factor 
supporting its important biological activities, such as anticancer, antidiabetic 
and anti-inflammatory properties. The antioxidant activity of UD is also found 
to be protective in different organs, including the brain, liver, lungs, kidney, 
ovary, and uterus, and may also be protective against diseases associated with 
these organs. Few clinical studies have endorsed the antioxidant potential of UD 
in patients. The current work is an attempt to comprehensively compile and 
discuss the antioxidant activity of UD from in vitro, in vivo and human studies. 
The insights of the current study would be helpful in getting a panoramic view 
of the antioxidant potential of UD, and provide direction for optimizing and 
developing it for therapeutic applications against important diseases and 
conditions in the near future."
2095,"Lead and cadmium are non-essential and toxic heavy metals. Their presence and 
elevated levels can lead to many pathologies. They disrupt the antioxidant 
properties of many enzymes, consume the resources of antioxidant cells, and thus 
participate in the generation of oxidative stress, which may result in DNA 
damage. In addition, they have been found to be carcinogenic through their 
genotoxic properties. They have been shown to be present in various types of 
cancer, including cancer of the female reproductive system. Both metals have 
been recognized as metalloestrogens, which are important in hormone-related 
cancers. Participation in the oncogenesis of ovarian, endometrial and cervical 
cancer was analysed in detail, using the available research in this field. We 
emphasize their role as potential biomarkers in cancer risk and diagnosis as 
well as advancement of gynaecological malignancies."
2096,"Chemoprevention is a method of health control in modern industrialized 
societies. Traditional breeding (hybridization) has been widely used to produce 
new (sub)species with beneficial phenotypes. Previously, we produced a number of 
doubled haploid (DH) lines of Brassica rapa with a high glucosinolate (GSL) 
content. In this study, we evaluated the anticancer activities of extracts from 
three selected high-GSL (HGSL)-containing DH lines (DHLs) of Brassica rapa in 
human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The three HGSL DHL extracts showed 
anti-proliferative activities in the 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assay and pro-apoptotic 
activities in the cell cycle or annexin V analysis with the induction of 
pro-apoptotic protein expression in CRC cells. Mechanistically, HGSL DHL 
extracts inhibited the NF-κB and ERK pathways, leading to a reduction in the 
nuclear localization of NF-κB p65. In addition, reactive oxygen species were 
induced by HGSL DHL extract treatment in CRC cells. In conclusion, our data 
suggest that the newly developed HGSL DHLs possess enhanced anticancer 
activities and are potentially helpful as a daily vegetable supplement with 
chemopreventive activities."
2097,"Coffee consumption positively influences colon health. Conversely, high levels 
of tryptophan metabolites such as skatole released from intestinal putrefactive 
fermentation in the presence of excessive dietary animal protein intake, and gut 
microbiota alterations, may have several adverse effects, including the 
development of colorectal cancer. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the 
potential protective effects of coffee in the presence of different skatole 
levels. The results showed that skatole exposure induced reduced cell viability 
and oxidative stress in the HT-29 human colon cancer cell line. However, 
co-treatment of cells with skatole and coffee samples was able to reduce ROS 
production (up to 45% for espresso) compared to cells not treated with coffee. 
Real-time PCR analysis highlighted that treating HT-29 cells with skatole 
increased the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines TNF-α, IL-1β, 
IL-8, and IL12, whereas exposure to coffee extracts in cells that were 
pretreated with skatole showed anti-inflammatory effects with decreased levels 
of these cytokines. These findings demonstrate that coffee may counteract the 
adverse effects of putrefactive compounds by modulating oxidative stress and 
exerting anti-inflammatory activity in colonocytes, thus suggesting that coffee 
intake could improve health conditions in the presence of altered intestinal 
microbiota metabolism."
2098,"SLC7A11 is a cell transmembrane protein composing the light chain of system xc-, 
transporting extracellular cystine into cells for cysteine production and GSH 
biosynthesis. SLC7A11 is a critical gateway for redox homeostasis by maintaining 
the cellular levels of GSH that counter cellular oxidative stress and suppress 
ferroptosis. SLC7A11 is overexpressed in various human cancers and regulates 
tumor development, proliferation, metastasis, microenvironment, and treatment 
resistance. Upregulation of SLC7A11 in cancers is needed to adapt to high 
oxidative stress microenvironments and maintain cellular redox homeostasis. High 
basal ROS levels and SLC7A11 dependences in cancer cells render them vulnerable 
to further oxidative stress. Therefore, cyst(e)ine depletion may be an effective 
new strategy for cancer treatment. However, the effectiveness of the SLC7A11 
inhibitors or cyst(e)inase has been established in many preclinical studies but 
has not reached the stage of clinical trials for cancer patients. A better 
understanding of cysteine and SLC7A11 functions regulating and interacting with 
redox-active proteins and their substrates could be a promising strategy for 
cancer treatment. Therefore, this review intends to understand the role of 
cysteine in antioxidant and redox signaling, the regulators of cysteine 
bioavailability in cancer, the role of SLC7A11 linking cysteine redox signaling 
in cancer metabolism and targeting SLC7A11 for novel cancer therapeutics."
2099,"Cyanobacteria are rich in phytochemicals, which have beneficial impacts on the 
prevention of many diseases. This study aimed to comprehensively characterize 
phytochemicals and evaluate multifunctional bioactivities in the ethanolic 
extract of the cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya sp. KC45. Results found that the 
extract mainly contained chlorophylls, carotenoids, phenolics, and flavonoids. 
Through LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS analysis, 38 phenolic compounds with promising 
bioactivities were discovered, and a higher diversity of flavonoids was found 
among the phenolic compounds identified. The extract effectively absorbed the 
harmful UV rays and showed high antioxidant activity on DPPH, ABTS, and PFRAP. 
The extract yielded high-efficiency inhibitory effects on enzymes (tyrosinase, 
collagenase, ACE, and α-glucosidase) related to diseases. Interestingly, the 
extract showed a strong cytotoxic effect on cancer cells (skin A375, lung A549, 
and colon Caco-2), but had a much smaller effect on normal cells, indicating a 
satisfactory level of safety for the extract. More importantly, the combination 
of the DNA ladder assay and the TUNEL assay proved the appearance of DNA 
fragmentation in cancer cells after a 48 h treatment with the extract, 
confirming the apoptosis mechanisms. Our findings suggest that cyanobacterium 
extract could be potentially used as a functional ingredient for various 
industrial applications in foods, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and 
nutraceuticals."
2100,"Polyphenols are bioactive compounds from plants with antioxidant properties that 
may have a protective role against body weight gain, with adipose tissue and 
systemic oxidative stress as potential targets. We aimed to investigate the 
dietary intake of individual polyphenols and their association with 5-year body 
weight change in a sub-cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into 
Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). This study included 349,165 adult participants from 
nine European countries. Polyphenol intake was estimated through 
country-specific validated dietary questionnaires and the Phenol-Explorer 
database. Body weight was obtained at recruitment and after a mean follow-up 
time of 5 years. Associations were estimated using multilevel mixed linear 
regression models. From 91 polyphenols included, the majority (n = 67) were 
inversely associated with 5-year body weight change after FDR-correction (q &lt; 
0.05). The greatest inverse associations were observed for quercetin 
3-O-rhamnoside (change in weight for doubling in intake: -0.071 (95% CI: -0.085; 
-0.056) kg/5 years). Only 13 polyphenols showed positive associations with body 
weight gain, mainly from the subclass hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) with coffee 
as the main dietary source, such as 4-caffeoylquinic acid (0.029 (95% CI: 0.021; 
0.038) kg/5 years). Individual polyphenols with fruit, tea, cocoa and whole 
grain cereals as the main dietary sources may contribute to body weight 
maintenance in adults. Individual HCAs may have different roles in body weight 
change depending on their dietary source."
2101,"Legumes are a highly nutritious source of plant protein, fiber, minerals and 
vitamins. However, they also contain several bioactive compounds with 
significant potential benefits for human health. The objectives of this study 
were to evaluate the antioxidant, antitumor and chemopreventive activity of 
functional extracts from legumes using raw and germinated flours of six legume 
species of commercial interest. The methodology carried out consisted on the 
development of protein hydrolysates, assessment of their antioxidant capacity 
and in vitro tests on T84, HCT15 and SW480 colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. 
Our results showed a high antitumor activity of protein hydrolysate from M. 
sativa. Likewise, when combined with 5-Fluorouracile (5-Fu), there was a 
synergistic effect using extract concentrations from 50 to 175 µg/mL and 5-Fu 
concentrations from 1.5 to 5 µM. Similarly, the induction effect on detoxifying 
enzymes by the extracts of M. sativa, germinated V. faba Baraca × LVzt1 and V. 
narbonensis, which produced a higher induction rate than the positive control 
sulforaphane (10 µM), should be highlighted. Therefore, incorporating these 
enzymes into the diet could provide nutritional effects, as well as play an 
effective role in cancer chemoprevention and therapy."
2102,"Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) has been reported as one of the major targets 
for ferroptosis induction, due to its pivotal role in lipid hydroperoxide 
removal. However, recent studies pointed toward alternative antioxidant systems 
in this context, such as the Coenzyme Q-FSP1 pathway. To investigate how 
effective these alternative pathways are in different cellular contexts, we used 
human colon adenocarcinoma (CRC) cells, highly resistant to GPX4 inhibition. 
Data obtained in the study showed that simultaneous pharmacological inhibition 
of GPX4 and FSP1 strongly compromised the survival of the CRC cells, which was 
prevented by the ferroptosis inhibitor, ferrostatin-1. Nonetheless, this could 
not be phenocopied by genetic deletion of FSP1, suggesting the development of 
resistance to ferroptosis in FSP1-KO CRC cells. Considering that CRC cells are 
highly glycolytic, we used CRC Warburg-incompetent cells, to investigate the 
role metabolism plays in this phenomenon. Indeed, the sensitivity to inhibition 
of both anti-ferroptotic axes (GPx4 and FSP1) was fully revealed in these cells, 
showing typical features of ferroptosis. Collectively, data indicate that two 
independent anti-ferroptotic pathways (GPX4-GSH and CoQ10-FSP1) operate within 
the overall physiological context of cancer cells and in some instances, their 
inhibition should be coupled with other metabolic modulators, such as inhibitors 
of glycolysis/Warburg effect."
2103,"Radiotherapy (RT) is part of the standard treatment of breast cancer (BC) 
because of its effects on relapse reduction and survival. However, response to 
treatment is highly variable, and some patients may develop disease progression 
(DP), a second primary cancer, or may succumb to the disease. Antioxidant 
systems and inflammatory processes are associated with the onset and development 
of BC and play a role in resistance to treatment. Here, we report our 
investigation into the clinical evolution of BC patients, and the impact of RT 
on the circulating levels of the antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase-1 (PON1), 
cytokines, and other standard biochemical and hematological variables. Gradient 
Boosting Machine (GBM) algorithm was used to identify predictive variables. This 
was a retrospective study in 237 patients with BC. Blood samples were obtained 
pre- and post-RT, with samples of healthy women used as control subjects. 
Results showed that 24 patients had DP eight years post-RT, and eight patients 
developed a second primary tumor. The algorithm identified interleukin-4 and 
total lymphocyte counts as the most relevant indices discriminating between BC 
patients and control subjects, while neutrophils, total leukocytes, eosinophils, 
very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and PON1 activity were potential 
predictors of fatal outcome."
2104,"Over three million Americans are affected by skin cancer each year, largely as a 
result of exposure to sunlight. The purpose of this study was to determine the 
potential of grape consumption to modulate UV-induced skin erythema. With 29 
human volunteers, we report that nine demonstrated greater resistance to UV 
irradiation of the skin after consuming the equivalent of three servings of 
grapes per day for two weeks. We further explored any potential relationship to 
the gut-skin axis. Alpha- and beta-diversity of the gut microbiome were not 
altered, but grape consumption modulated microbiota abundance, enzyme levels, 
and KEGG pathways. Striking differences in the microbiome and metabolome were 
discerned when comparing the nine individuals showing greater UV resistance with 
the 20 non-responders. Notably, three urinary metabolites, 2'-deoxyribonic acid, 
3-hydroxyphenyl acetic and scyllo-inositol, were depressed in the UV-resistant 
group. A ROC curve revealed a 71.8% probability that measurement of urinary 
2'-deoxyribonic acid identifies a UV skin non-responder. 2'-Deoxyribonic acid is 
cleaved from the DNA backbone by reactive oxygen species. Three of the nine 
subjects acquiring UV resistance following grape consumption showed a durable 
response, and these three demonstrated unique microbiomic and metabolomic 
profiles. Variable UV skin sensitivity was likely due to glutathione 
S-transferase polymorphisms. We conclude that a segment of the population is 
capable of demonstrating greater resistance to a dermal response elicited by UV 
irradiation as a result of grape consumption. It is uncertain if modulation of 
the gut-skin axis leads to enhanced UV resistance, but there is correlation. 
More broadly, it is reasonable to expect that these mechanisms relate to other 
health outcomes anticipated to result from grape consumption."
2105,"Colorectal cancer (CRC), associated with an increased intake of processed red 
meats, saturated fats, and simple carbohydrates accompanied by low dietary 
fiber, fruits, and vegetables consumption, presents a high epidemiological 
burden. Connexin43 (Cx43) protein, which forms gap junctions or hemichannels, 
has tumor suppressor or oncogenic activities in a cancer type- and 
stage-dependent manner. Cx43 expression varies during colon carcinogenesis, and 
its functional role is not fully understood. Thus, we evaluated the implications 
of Cx43 heterologous deletion (Cx43+/-) during the early stages of a chemically 
induced model of colon carcinogenesis. Female C57BL/6J mice (wild-type or 
Cx43+/-) were submitted to a colon carcinogenesis model induced by 1,2 
dimethylhydrazine (DMH). Mice were euthanized eight hours (week 7) or 30 weeks 
(week 37) after the last DMH administration to evaluate subacute colon toxicity 
outcomes or the burden of (pre)neoplastic lesions, respectively. At week 7, Cx43 
deficiency inferred no alterations in the DMH-induced increase in systemic 
(peripheral blood), in situ (colonocytes) DNA damage, and apoptosis in the 
colonocytes. At week 30, Cx43+/- mice presented an increase in preneoplastic 
aberrant crypt foci (ACF) multiplicity, while no alterations were observed in 
colorectal adenoma (CRA) occurrence, multiplicity, volume, proliferation, 
growth, and β-catenin immunoexpression. Similarly, an in silico analysis of 
human CRA showed decreased mRNA expression of Cx43 with no correlation with 
proliferation, apoptosis, and β-catenin markers. These findings indicate the 
discrete role of Cx43 in the early stages of chemically induced mouse colon 
carcinogenesis."
2106,"Phytochemicals from plant foods are considered essential to human health. Known 
for their role in the adaptation of plants to their environment, these compounds 
can induce adaptive responses in cells, many of which are directed at 
maintaining the redox tone. Indicaxanthin is a long-known betalain pigment found 
in the genus Opuntia of cactus pear and highly concentrated in the edible fruits 
of O. ficus indica, L. whose bioactivity has been overlooked until recently. 
This review summarizes studies conducted so far in vitro and in vivo, most of 
which have been performed in our laboratory. The chemical and physicochemical 
characteristics of Indicaxanthin are reflected in the molecule's reducing 
properties and antioxidant effects and help explain its ability to interact with 
membranes, modulate redox-regulated cellular pathways, and possibly bind to 
protein molecules. Measurement of bioavailability in volunteers has been key to 
exploring its bioactivity; amounts consistent with dietary intake, or plasma 
concentration after dietary consumption of cactus pear fruit, have been used in 
experimental setups mimicking physiological or pathophysiological conditions, in 
cells and in animals, finally suggesting pharmacological potential and relevance 
of Indicaxanthin as a nutraceutical. In reporting experimental results, this 
review also aimed to raise questions and seek insights for further basic 
research and health promotion applications."
2107,"Manganese Superoxide Dismutase (MnSOD) represents a mitochondrial protein that 
scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for oxidative stress. A 
known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4880 on the SOD2 gene, causing a 
mutation from alanine to valine (Ala16Val) in the primary structure of immature 
MnSOD, has been associated with several types of cancer and other autoimmune 
diseases. However, no conclusive correlation has been established yet. This 
study aims to determine the effect of the alanine to valine mutation on the 
secondary structure of the MnSOD mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). A model 
for each variant of the MTS was prepared and extensively simulated with 
molecular dynamics simulations using the CHARMM36m force field. The results 
indicate that the alanine variant of the MTS preserves a uniform α-helical 
secondary structure favorable for the protein transport into mitochondria, 
whereas the valine variant quickly breaks down its α-helix. Thus, the alanine 
MTS represents the more active MnSOD variant, the benefits of which have yet to 
be determined experimentally."
2108,"Synthetic trans-(±)-kusunokinin ((±)KU), a potential anticancer substance, was 
revealed to have an inhibitory effect on breast cancer. According to the 
computational modeling prediction, AKR1B1, an oxidative stress and cancer 
migration protein, could be a target protein of trans-(-)-kusunokinin. In this 
study, we determined the binding of (±)KU and AKR1B1 on triple-negative breast 
and non-serous ovarian cancers. We found that (±)KU exhibited a cytotoxic effect 
that was significantly stronger than zopolrestat (ZP) and epalrestat (EP) (known 
AKR1B1 inhibitors) on breast and ovarian cancer cells. (±)KU inhibited aldose 
reductase activity that was stronger than trans-(-)-arctiin ((-)AR) but weaker 
than ZP and EP. Interestingly, (±)KU stabilized AKR1B1 on SKOV3 and Hs578T cells 
after being heated at 60 and 75 °C, respectively. (±)KU decreased 
malondialdehyde (MDA), an oxidative stress marker, on Hs578T cells in a 
dose-dependent manner and the suppression was stronger than EP. Furthermore, 
(±)KU downregulated AKR1B1 and its downstream proteins, including PKC-δ, NF-κB, 
AKT, Nrf2, COX2, Twist2 and N-cadherin and up-regulated E-cadherin. (±)KU showed 
an inhibitory effect on AKR1B1 and its downstream proteins, similar to 
siRNA-AKR1B1. Interestingly, the combination of siRNA-AKR1B1 with EP or (±)KU 
showed a greater effect on the suppression of AKR1B1, N-cadherin, E-cadherin and 
NF-κB than single treatments. Taken together, we concluded that (±)KU-bound 
AKR1B1 leads to the attenuation of cellular oxidative stress, as well as the 
aggressiveness of breast cancer cell migration."
2109,"Organisms are continually exposed to exogenous and endogenous sources of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other oxidants that have both beneficial and 
deleterious effects on the cell. ROS have important roles in a wide range of 
physiological processes; however, high ROS levels are associated with oxidative 
stress and disease progression. Oxidative stress has been implicated in nearly 
all major human diseases, from neurogenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric 
disorders to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Antioxidant defence 
systems have evolved as a means of protection against oxidative stress, with the 
transcription factor Nrf2 as the key regulator. Nrf2 is responsible for 
regulating an extensive panel of antioxidant enzymes involved in the 
detoxification and elimination of oxidative stress and has been extensively 
studied in the disease contexts. This review aims to provide the reader with a 
general overview of oxidative stress and Nrf2, including basic mechanisms of 
Nrf2 activation and regulation, and implications in various major human 
diseases."
2110,"Interleukin-33 (IL-33) acts as an 'alarmin', and its role has been demonstrated 
in driving immune regulation and inflammation in many human diseases. However, 
the precise mechanism of action of IL-33 in regulating neutrophil and macrophage 
functioning is not defined in advanced atherosclerosis (aAT) patients. Further, 
the role of IL-33 in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in aAT and 
its consequent effect on macrophage function is not known. In the present study, 
we recruited n = 52 aAT patients and n = 52 control subjects. The neutrophils 
were isolated from both groups via ficoll/percoll-based density gradient 
centrifugation. The effect of IL-33 on the NET formation ability of the 
neutrophils was determined in both groups. Monocytes, isolated via a positive 
selection method, were used to differentiate them into macrophages from each of 
the study subjects and were challenged by IL-33-primed NETs, followed by the 
measurement of oxidative stress by calorimetric assay and the expression of the 
proinflammatory molecules by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Transcript and protein 
expression was determined by qPCR and immunofluorescence/ELISA, respectively. 
The increased expression of IL-33R (ST-2) was observed in the neutrophils, along 
with an increased serum concentration of IL-33 in aAT compared to the controls. 
IL-33 exacerbates NET formation via specifically upregulating CD16 expression in 
aAT. IL-33-primed NETs/neutrophils increased the cellular oxidative stress 
levels in the macrophages, leading to enhanced macrophage necroptosis and the 
release of atherogenic factors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in aAT 
compared to the controls. These findings suggested a pathogenic effect of the 
IL-33/ST-2 pathway in aAT patients by exacerbating NET formation and macrophage 
necroptosis, thereby facilitating the release of inflammatory factors and the 
release of MMPs that may be critical for the destabilization/rupture of 
atherosclerotic plaques in aAT. Targeting the IL-33/ST-2-NETs axis may be a 
promising therapeutic target for preventing plaque instability/rupture and its 
adverse complications in aAT."
2111,"Gastric ulcers are commonly seen in the upper gastrointestinal tract and may be 
related to the Helicobacter pylori infection and the use of aspirin, a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Typically, proton-pump inhibitors 
(PPIs) are used to treat gastric ulcers; however, adverse effects have emerged 
following long-term treatment. Natural medicines are used as alternative 
therapeutic agents in the treatment of gastric ulcers, with few side effects. 
Despite various reports on the anti-H. pylori and anti-gastric cancer activities 
of Anisomeles indica, its gastroprotective effect on ulcers remains 
undetermined. This study investigated the protective effect of A. indica on 
aspirin-induced gastric ulcers in murine models. Our results show that three 
fractions of ethanol-extracted A. indica inhibited aspirin-induced gastric 
injury. Among these, A. indica Fraction 1 was observed to enrich ovatodiolide, 
which effectively diminished gastric acidity and alleviated aspirin-induced 
inflammation in the stomach. Our results provide evidence that A. indica could 
be developed as an effective therapeutic agent for gastroprotective purposes."
2112,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are normal products of a number of biochemical 
reactions and are important signaling molecules. However, at the same time, they 
are toxic to cells and have to be strictly regulated by their antioxidant 
systems. The etiology and pathogenesis of many diseases are associated with 
increased ROS levels, and many external stress factors directly or indirectly 
cause oxidative stress in cells. Within this context, the overexpression of 
genes encoding the proteins in antioxidant systems seems to have become a viable 
approach to decrease the oxidative stress caused by pathological conditions and 
to increase cellular stress resistance. However, such manipulations unavoidably 
lead to side effects, the most dangerous of which is an increased probability of 
healthy tissue malignization or increased tumor aggression. The aims of the 
present review were to collect and systematize the results of studies devoted to 
the effects resulting from the overexpression of antioxidant system genes on 
stress resistance and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In most cases, the 
overexpression of these genes was shown to increase cell and organism 
resistances to factors that induce oxidative and genotoxic stress but to also 
have different effects on cancer initiation and promotion. The last fact greatly 
limits perspectives of such manipulations in practice. The overexpression of 
GPX3 and SOD3 encoding secreted proteins seems to be the ""safest"" among the 
genes that can increase cell resistance to oxidative stress. High efficiency and 
safety potential can also be found for SOD2 overexpression in combinations with 
GPX1 or CAT and for similar combinations that lead to no significant changes in 
H2O2 levels. Accumulation, systematization, and the integral analysis of data on 
antioxidant gene overexpression effects can help to develop approaches for 
practical uses in biomedical and agricultural areas. Additionally, a number of 
factors such as genetic and functional context, cell and tissue type, 
differences in the function of transcripts of one and the same gene, regulatory 
interactions, and additional functions should be taken into account."
2113,"Gypothamnium pinifolium Phil. (Asteraceae) is a small shrub that grows in the 
Paposo Valley of the II Antofagasta Region of Chile. This initial study is of 
the high-resolution phenolic fingerprinting, antioxidant activity, the 
relaxation effects in rat aorta, the inhibitory enzyme potential, plus the 
antiproliferative activity of the ethyl acetate and n-hexane extract from G. 
pinifolium and its two major isolated secondary metabolites (one coumarin: 
2-nor-1,2-secolycoserone, and one diterpene: ent-labda-8,13-E-diene-15-ol). The 
study involves using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography todiode array 
detection coupled with Q-Orbitrap mass spectrometry analysis 
(UHPLC-PDA-Orbi-trap-MS), in which various compounds were identified, including 
specific coumarins. The n-hexane extract showed total phenolic and flavonoid 
contents of 517.4 ± 12.5 mg GAE/100 g extract and 72.3 ± 3.7 mg QE/100 g 
extract, respectively. In addition, the antioxidant activity of the n-hexane 
extract was assessed using in-vitro assays such as bleaching of DPPH and ABTS 
(IC50: 14.3 ± 0.52 and 2.51 ± 0.43 µg extract/mL, respectively), FRAP (347.12 ± 
1.15 μmol Trolox equivalent/g extract), and ORAC (287.3 ± 1.54 μmol Trolox 
equivalents/g extract). Furthermore, the inhibition against cholinesterases 
(acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 4.58 ± 0.04 µg/mL, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) 
IC50: 23.44 ± 0.03 µg/mL) and tyrosinase (IC50: 9.25 ± 0.15 µg/mL) enzymes of 
the n-hexane extract, and main compounds (IC50: 1.21 ± 0.03 µg/mL, 11.23 ± 0.02 
µg/mL, 3.23 ± 0.12 µg/mL, and 103.43 ± 16.86 µg/mL, correspondingly for the most 
active coumarin 1) were measured. The antiproliferative potential of the 
extracts and the two principal compounds against several solid human cancer 
cells was investigated. All of them showed good activity against cancer cells. 
Label-free live-cell imaging studies on HeLa cells exposed to the isolated 
coumarin and the diterpene enabled the observation of cell death and several 
apoptotic hallmarks. Our results indicate that G. pinifolium Phil. is a valuable 
source of secondary metabolites with potential activity against noncommunicable 
diseases."
2114,"Haberlea rhodopensis is a Balkan endemic plant that belongs to the Gesneriaceae 
family, and is believed to have medicinal use and health-promoting properties. 
This study aimed to (i) prepare aqueous (HAE) and ethanolic (HEE) extracts from 
the leaves of H. rhodopensis from in vitro propagated plants, (ii) screen for 
their potential antiproliferative and antimigratory activities, and (iii) 
chemically characterize both HAE and HEE by identifying compounds which may 
contribute to their observed bioactivity thereby further supporting their 
potential use in biomedical applications. The antiproliferative activity of both 
extracts was assessed against six human cancer cell lines by employing the 
sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay. HEE was found to be more potent in inhibiting 
cancer cell growth as compared to HAE. Therefore, HEE's antimigratory effects 
were further studied in hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and non-small cell lung 
adenocarcinoma (A459) cell lines as they were among the most sensitive ones to 
its antiproliferative activity. HEE was found to exert significant antimigratory 
concentration-dependent effects in both cell lines assessed with the wound 
healing assay. Chemical characterization by UPLC-MS/MS analysis identified that 
HEE contains higher levels of flavonoids, phenolic compounds, pigments 
(chlorophyll-/-b, lycopene, and β-carotene), monoterpenoids, and condensed 
tannins compared to HAE, while HAE, contains higher levels of soluble protein 
and sugars. Furthermore, HEE demonstrated remarkable antioxidant activity 
evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH●), 2,2-azinobis 
(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS●+) and ferric 
reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. We have obtained comprehensive results 
highlighting the potential of HEE as a source of bioactive compounds with 
anticancer properties. Future studies should aim at identifying the chemical 
constituents responsible for the bioactivities observed, and focus on 
investigating HEE's effects, in in vivo preclinical cancer models."
2115,"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a non-invasive imaging technique which 
allows qualitative and quantitative assessment of tissue perfusion. Although 
CEUS offers numerous advantages, a major challenge remains the variability in 
tissue perfusion quantification. This study aimed to assess intra- and 
inter-observer variability for quantification of renal perfusion. Two observers 
with different levels of expertise performed a quantitative analysis of 36 renal 
CEUS studies, twice. The CEUS data were collected from 12 healthy cats at 3 
different time points with a 7-day interval. The inter- and intra-observer 
agreement was assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient. Within and 
between observers, a good agreement was demonstrated for intensity-related 
parameters in the cortex, medulla, and interlobular artery. For some parameters, 
ICCinter was considerably lower than ICCintra, mostly when the ROI encompassed 
the entire kidney or medulla. With the exception of time to peak (TTP) and mean 
transit time (mTTI), time-related and slope-related parameters showed poor 
agreement among observers. In conclusion, it may be advised against having the 
quantitative assessment of renal perfusion performed by different observers, 
especially if their experience levels differ. The cortical mTTI seemed to be the 
most appropriate parameter as it showed a favorable inter-observer agreement and 
inter-period agreement."
2116,"Nasturtium officinale contains high amounts of phytochemical compounds that work 
against oxidative damages leading to improved health conditions in animals as 
well as humans. The study was performed to investigate the health benefits of 
nonencapsulated and nanoliposome-encapsulated phenolic rich fractions obtained 
from Nasturtium officinale on mice induced colorectal cancer. The experiment 
focused on encapsulation efficiency in improving the effectiveness of plant 
bioactive compounds. Phenolic rich fractions (PRF) were successfully loaded in 
the nanoliposome structure, a nanometer in size, of spherical shape and with 
homogeneous dispersion. Induction of colorectal cancer in mice impaired weight 
gain and feed intake, liver function and structural characteristics of ileum, 
while the dietary administration of nanoliposome-encapsulated PRF regulated the 
expression of Caspase 3, Bax, Bcl2, iNOS and SOD genes in the tumor tissue. The 
addition of nonencapsulated PRF and nanoliposome encapsulated PRF at the 
concentration of 100 mg TPC/kg BW/day improved the genes expression, although 
the nanoliposome-encapsulated PRF revealed better health outcomes compared to 
nonencapsulated PRF. Furthermore, both PRF improved intestinal morphology when 
the mice were challenged with colorectal cancer. The higher health promoting 
activity of nanoliposome-encapsulated PRF could be associated with its enhanced 
intestinal absorption, bioavailability, bioaccessibility and bioactivity. 
Consequently, the nanoliposome-encapsulated PRF could be considered as a 
promising anticancer agent against colorectal cancer."
2117,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is highly aggressive with poor patient outcomes, 
and a deeper understanding of ovarian cancer tumorigenesis could help guide 
future treatment development. We proposed an optimized hit network-target sets 
model to systematically characterize the underlying pathological mechanisms and 
intra-tumoral heterogeneity in human ovarian cancer. Using TCGA data, we 
constructed an epithelial ovarian cancer regulatory network in this study. We 
use three distinct methods to produce different HNSs for identification of the 
driver genes/nodes, core modules, and core genes/nodes. Following the creation 
of the optimized HNS (OHNS) by the integration of DN (driver nodes), CM (core 
module), and CN (core nodes), the effectiveness of various HNSs was assessed 
based on the significance of the network topology, control potential, and 
clinical value. Immunohistochemical (IHC), qRT-PCR, and Western blotting were 
adopted to measure the expression of hub genes and proteins involved in 
epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We discovered that the OHNS has two key 
advantages: the network's central location and controllability. It also plays a 
significant role in the illness network due to its wide range of capabilities. 
The OHNS and clinical samples revealed the endometrial cancer signaling, and the 
PI3K/AKT, NER, and BMP pathways. MUC16, FOXA1, FBXL2, ARID1A, COX15, COX17, 
SCO1, SCO2, NDUFA4L2, NDUFA, and PTEN hub genes were predicted and may serve as 
potential candidates for new treatments and biomarkers for EOC. This research 
can aid in better capturing the disease progression, the creation of potent 
multi-target medications, and the direction of the therapeutic community in the 
optimization of effective treatment regimens by various research objectives in 
cancer treatment."
2118,"During development, thyroid hormones play an important role in eye development, 
while in adults, some pathological thyroid conditions can affect the normal 
functioning of the eyes. Thyroid eye disease is the most well-known eye 
pathology caused by a pathological thyroid condition. Few studies have 
investigated the association between ocular parameters and thyroid function. 
Thus, in this study, we aimed to examine whether thyroid activity affects ocular 
parameters. This cross-sectional study included 4633 healthy adults recruited 
within the 10,001 Dalmatians project of the Croatian Biobank. The plasma levels 
of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free 
thyroxine (fT4), thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb), and 
thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) were measured by an immunoassay. We 
determined 20 ocular parameters for each participant (10 for each eye, including 
corneal radius, corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber 
angle, lens thickness, posterior chamber length, axial length, intraocular lens 
power (IOL), spherical power, and cylinder power). Patients with hyperthyroidism 
had thicker corneas compared to euthyroid individuals. Corneal thickness was 
also negatively associated with plasma TSH levels. Intra-ocular lens power was 
higher in patients with clinical hypothyroidism, while spherical power was 
higher in euthyroid individuals with positive antibodies compared to euthyroid 
individuals. Intra-ocular lens power negatively correlated with fT4 levels, 
while spherical power positively correlated with TgAb, TPOAb, and Tg levels and 
negatively correlated with TSH levels. The anterior chamber angle was positively 
associated with plasma TSH levels and TPOAb levels and negatively associated 
with plasma fT4 levels. These findings suggest an interesting interplay between 
ophthalmic measures and thyroid status, detectable even in the general adult 
population."
2119,"Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are a promising platform for their use in 
biomedical research, especially given their anticancer and antimicrobial 
activities. This work presents the synthesis of ZnO NPs doped with different 
amounts of rare-earth ions of ytterbium (Yb) and cerium (Ce) and the assessment 
of their anticancer and antimicrobial activities. The structural investigations 
indicated a hexagonal wurtzite structure for all prepared NPs. The particle size 
was reduced by raising the amount of Ce and Yb in ZnO. The anticancer 
capabilities of the samples were examined by the cell viability MTT assay. Post 
48-h treatment showed a reduction in the cancer cell viability, which was x = 
0.00 (68%), x = 0.01 (58.70%), x = 0.03 (80.94%) and x = 0.05 (64.91%), 
respectively. We found that samples doped with x = 0.01 and x = 0.05 of Yb and 
Ce showed a better inhibitory effect on HCT-116 cancer cells than unadded ZnO (x 
= 0.00). The IC50 for HCT-116 cells of Ce and Yb co-doped ZnO nanoparticles was 
calculated and the IC50 values were x = 0.01 (3.50 µg/mL), x = 0.05 (8.25 
µg/mL), x = 0.00 (11.75 µg/mL), and x = 0.03 (21.50 µg/mL). The treatment-doped 
ZnO NPs caused apoptotic cell death in the HCT-116 cells. The nanoparticles 
showed inhibitory action on both C. albicans and E. coli. It can be concluded 
that doping ZnO NPs with Yb and Ce improves their apoptotic effects on cancer 
and microbial cells."
2120,"BACKGROUND: In children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), volume 
overload (VO) is inevitable, and the right ventricle (RV) pumps blood into the 
systemic circulation. Understanding the molecular differences and their 
different responses to VO between the RV and left ventricle (LV) at the neonatal 
and highly plastic stages may improve the long-term management of children with 
HLHS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A neonatal rat ventricular VO model was established by the 
creation of a fistula between the inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta on 
postnatal day 1 (P1) and confirmed by echocardiographic and histopathological 
analyses. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that some of the major 
differences between a normal neonatal RV and LV were associated with the thyroid 
hormone and insulin signaling pathways. Under the influence of VO, the levels of 
insulin receptors and thyroid hormone receptors were significantly increased in 
the LV but decreased in the RV. The transcriptomic analysis also demonstrated 
that under the influence of VO, the top two common enriched pathways between the 
RV and LV were the insulin and thyroid hormone signaling pathways, whereas the 
RV-specific enriched pathways were primarily associated with lipid metabolism 
and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC); further, the 
LV-specific enriched pathways were primarily associated with nucleic acid 
metabolism and microRNAs in cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Insulin and thyroid hormones may play critical roles in the 
differences between a neonatal RV and LV as well as their common responses to 
VO. Regarding the isolated responses to VO, the RV favors an ARVC change and the 
LV favors a reduction in microRNAs in cancer. The current study suggests that 
insulin, thyroid hormone, and cancer-associated microRNAs are potential 
therapeutic targets that should be explored by basic science studies to improve 
the function of the RV to match that of the LV."
2121,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a severe disease mostly caused by asbestos 
exposure. Today, one of the best available biomarkers is the soluble 
mesothelin-related protein (SMRP), also known as mesothelin. Recent studies have 
shown that mesothelin levels are influenced by individual genetic variability. 
This study aimed to investigate the influence of three mesothelin (MSLN) gene 
variants (SNPs) in the 5'-untranslated promoter region (5'-UTR), MSLN rs2235503 
C &gt; A, rs3764246 A &gt; G, rs3764247 A &gt; C, and one (rs1057147 G &gt; A) 
in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the MSLN gene on plasma concentrations 
of mesothelin in 410 asbestos-exposed males without cancer and 43 males with 
prediagnostic MM (i.e., with MM diagnosed later on) from the prospective MoMar 
study, as well as 59 males with manifest MM from Germany. The mesothelin 
concentration differed significantly between the different groups (p &lt; 
0.0001), but not between the prediagnostic and manifest MM groups (p = 0.502). 
Five to eight mutations of the four SNP variants studied were associated with 
increased mesothelin concentrations (p = 0.001). The highest mesothelin 
concentrations were observed for homozygous variants of the three promotor SNPs 
in the 5'-UTR (p &lt; 0.001), and the highest odds ratio for an elevated 
mesothelin concentration was observed for MSLN rs2235503 C &gt; A. The four 
studied SNPs had a clear influence on the mesothelin concentration in plasma. 
Hence, the analysis of these SNPs may help to elucidate the diagnostic 
background of patients displaying increased mesothelin levels and might help to 
reduce false-positive results when using mesothelin for MM screening in 
high-risk groups."
2122,"Background and aim: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated 
vasculitis (AAV) is a rare multisystem autoimmune disease developed by 
autoantibody production against human neutrophilic granulocytes, including 
proteinase-3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The management of AAV patients is 
difficult due to the multiorgan involvement, high rate of relapse, and 
complications of immunosuppressive agents that make it challenging. This study 
aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of rituximab (RTX) therapy in 
patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis 
(MPA) subtypes. Method: The PubMed/Medline database was searched for any studies 
related to RTX therapy in ANCA-associated vasculitis (GPA and MPA subtypes), 
from inception to 1 August 2022, and proceeded in accordance with Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Results: Our 
search resulted in 1082 initial records. After the elimination of review papers, 
irrelevant studies, and non-English records, 223 articles were included, and the 
data related to the efficacy and safety of RTX therapy were extracted. Several 
randomized and non-randomized studies showed that RTX is an effective treatment 
option for patients with AAV. Most of the studies showed the very effective 
effect of RTX in controlling disease in AAV patients, including pediatrics, 
adults, and elderlies, although RTX cannot completely prevent relapse. However, 
maintenance therapy helps delay the disease's relapse and causes sustained 
remission. Not only the licensed dose (375 mg/m2 intravenous per week for 4 
weeks) could induce disease remission, but studies also showed that a single 
infusion of RTX could be effective. Although RTX could resolve many rare 
manifestations in AAV patients, there are few reports showing treatment failure. 
Additionally, few sudies have reported the unexpeted worsening of the disease 
after RTX administration. Generally, RTX is relatively safe compared to 
conventional therapies, but some serious adverse effects, mainly infections, 
cytopenia, hypogammaglobinemia, malignancy, and hypersensitivity have been 
reported. Conclusions: RTX is an effective and relatively safe therapeutic 
option for AAV. Studies on the evaluation of the safety profiles of RTX and the 
prevention of severe RTX-related side effects in AAV patients are required."
2123,"Height is inversely associated with inflammation that stimulates endothelial 
repair. In our previous study involving elderly men aged 60-69 years, we found 
that active arterial wall thickening, which is known as the process of 
endothelial repair, requires CD34-positive cells. As thyroid hormone regulates 
CD34-positive cell production and as the absence of thyroid cysts might indicate 
latent damage in the thyroid, the status of thyroid cysts possibly influences 
the association between height and active arterial wall thickening. We conducted 
a 2-year follow-up study of Japanese aged 60-69 years. For participants with 
thyroid cysts, height was significantly inversely associated with active 
arterial wall thickening (thyroid function and baseline CIMT adjusted odds ratio 
of active arterial wall thickening for one increment of standard deviation of 
height (5.7 cm for men and 4.8 cm for women), 0.66 [0.49, 0.89]), while for 
those without thyroid cysts, a positive tendency between the two parameters was 
observed (1.19 [0.96, 1.50]). An inverse association between height and active 
arterial wall thickening was observed only for elderly participants with thyroid 
cysts possibly because of a supportive role of thyroid hormone, as the absence 
of thyroid cysts might indicate latent damage in the thyroid."
2124,"The lack of precise molecular signatures limits the early diagnosis of non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study used gene expression data and 
interaction networks to develop a highly accurate model with the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for predicting NSCLC. The 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in NSCLC compared with 
normal tissues using TCGA and GTEx data. A biological network was constructed 
using DEGs, and the top 20 upregulated and 20 downregulated hub genes were 
identified. These hub genes were used to identify signature genes with penalized 
logistic regression using the LASSO to predict NSCLC. Our model's development 
involved the following steps: (i) the dataset was divided into 80% for training 
(TR) and 20% for testing (TD1); (ii) a LASSO logistic regression analysis was 
performed on the TR with 10-fold cross-validation and identified a combination 
of 17 genes as NSCLC predictors, which were used further for development of the 
LASSO model. The model's performance was assessed on the TD1 dataset and 
achieved an accuracy and an area under the curve of the receiver operating 
characteristics (AUC-ROC) of 0.986 and 0.998, respectively. Furthermore, the 
performance of the LASSO model was evaluated using three independent NSCLC test 
datasets (GSE18842, GSE27262, GSE19804) and achieved high accuracy, with an 
AUC-ROC of &gt;0.99, &gt;0.99, and 0.95, respectively. Based on this study, a 
web application called NSCLCpred was developed to predict NSCLC."
2125,"The human gastrointestinal microbiota contains a diverse consortium of microbes, 
including bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and fungi. Through millennia of 
co-evolution, the host-microbiota interactions have shaped the immune system to 
both tolerate and maintain the symbiotic relationship with commensal microbiota, 
while exerting protective responses against invading pathogens. Microbiome 
research is dominated by studies describing the impact of prokaryotic bacteria 
on gut immunity with a limited understanding of their relationship with other 
integral microbiota constituents. However, converging evidence shows that 
eukaryotic organisms, such as commensal protozoa, can play an important role in 
modulating intestinal immune responses as well as influencing the overall health 
of the host. The presence of several protozoa species has recently been shown to 
be a common occurrence in healthy populations worldwide, suggesting that many of 
these are commensals rather than invading pathogens. This review aims to discuss 
the most recent, conflicting findings regarding the role of intestinal protozoa 
in gut homeostasis, interactions between intestinal protozoa and the bacterial 
microbiota, as well as potential immunological consequences of protozoa 
colonization."
2126,"Lung cancer is a very prevalent and heterogeneous group of malignancies, and 
most of them are etiologically associated with tobacco smoking. However, viral 
infections have been detected in lung carcinomas, with high-risk human 
papillomaviruses (HR-HPVs) being among them. The role of HR-HPVs in lung cancer 
has been considered to be controversial. This issue is due to the highly 
variable presence of this virus in lung carcinomas worldwide, and the low viral 
load frequently that is detected. In this review, we address the epidemiological 
and mechanistic findings regarding the role of HR-HPVs in lung cancer. Some 
mechanisms of HR-HPV-mediated lung carcinogenesis have been proposed, including 
(i) HPV works as an independent carcinogen in non-smoker subjects; (ii) HPV 
cooperates with carcinogenic compounds present in tobacco smoke; (iii) HPV 
promotes initial alterations being after cleared by the immune system through a 
""hit and run"" mechanism. Additional research is warranted to clarify the role of 
HPV in lung cancer."
2127,"OBJECTIVE: The virtual reality (VR)-based path integration task shows 
substantial promise in predicting dementia risk. However, the reliability and 
validity in healthy populations need further exploration. The present study 
investigates the relationship between task indicators and brain structures in a 
healthy population using a VR-based navigation task, particularly the entorhinal 
cortex (EC) and hippocampus.
METHODS: Sixty healthy adults were randomly recruited to perform a VR-based path 
integration task, the digit span task (DST), and an MRI scan. The indicators of 
the VR-based path integration task were calculated, including the absolute 
distance error (ADE), degree of angle deviation (DAD), degree of path deviation 
(DPD), and return time (Time). The reliability of the above indicators was then 
estimated using the split-half method and Cronbach's alpha. Correlation and 
regression analyses were then performed to examine the associations between 
these indicators and age, general cognitive ability (DST), and brain structural 
measures.
RESULTS: ADE, DAD, and DPD showed reasonable split-half reliability estimates 
(0.84, 0.81, and 0.72) and nice Cronbach's alpha estimates (0.90, 0.86, and 
0.96). All indicators correlated with age and DST. ADE and DAD were sensitive 
predictors of hippocampal volume, and return time was a predictor of EC 
thickness.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the VR-based path integration task 
exhibits good reliability and validity in the healthy population. The task 
indicators are age-sensitive, can capture working memory capacity, and are 
closely related to the integrity of individual EC and hippocampal structures."
2128,"Given the lack of advances in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) therapy in 
recent years, pharmacological strategies to block OSCC-related signaling 
pathways have gained prominence. The present study aimed to evaluate the 
therapeutic potential of Arsenic Trioxide (ATO) concerning its antitumoral 
effects and the inhibition of the Hedgehog (HH) pathway in OSCC. Initially, ATO 
cytotoxicity was assessed in a panel of cell lines. Cell viability, cell cycle, 
death patterns, and cell morphology were analyzed, as well as the effect of ATO 
on the expression of HH pathway components. After the cytotoxic assay, HSC3 
cells were chosen for all in vitro assays. ATO increased apoptotic cell death 
and nuclear fragmentation in the sub-G1 cell cycle phase and promoted changes in 
cell morphology. In addition, the reduced expression of GLI1 indicated that ATO 
inhibits HH activity. The present study provides evidence of ATO as an effective 
cytotoxic drug for oral cancer treatment in vitro."
2129,"Protein convertases (PCs) play a significant role in post-translational 
procedures by transforming inactive precursor proteins into their active forms. 
The role of PCs is crucial for cellular homeostasis because they are involved in 
cell signaling. They have also been described in many diseases such as 
Alzheimer's and cancer. Cancer cells are secretory cells that send signals to 
the tumor microenvironment (TME), remodeling the surrounding space for their own 
benefits. One of the most important components of the TME is the immune system 
of the tumor. In this review, we describe recent discoveries that link PCs to 
the immune escape of tumors. Among PCs, many findings have determined the role 
of Furin (PC3) as a paramount enzyme causing the TME to induce tumor immune 
evasion. The overexpression of various cytokines and proteins, for instance, 
IL10 and TGF-B, moves the TME towards the presence of Tregs and, consequently, 
immune tolerance. Furthermore, Furin is implicated in the regulation of 
macrophage activity that contributes to the increased impairment of DCs 
(dendritic cells) and T effector cells. Moreover, Furin interferes in the MHC 
Class_1 proteolytic cleavage in the trans-Golgi network. In tumors, the T 
cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) response is impeded by the PD1 receptor (PD1-R) 
located on CTLs and its ligand, PDL1, located on cancer cells. The inhibition of 
Furin is a subtle means of enhancing the antitumor response by repressing PD-1 
expression in tumors or macrophage cells. The impacts of other PCs in tumor 
immune escape have not yet been clarified to the extent that Furin has. 
Accordingly, the influence of other types of PCs in tumor immune escape is a 
promising topic for further consideration."
2130,"Background: Radiotherapy is a mainstay in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC) treatment but is mostly applied without stratification by molecular 
diagnostics. Development of reliable biomarkers may have the potential to 
improve radiotherapy (RT) efficacy and reduce toxicity. We conducted a 
systematic review to summarize the field of biomarkers in HNSCC treated by RT. 
Methods: Pubmed and EMBASE were searched independently by two researchers 
following pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Z curves were generated 
to investigate publication bias. OncoKB was used for identification of druggable 
targets. Results: 134 manuscripts remained for data extraction. 12% of tumors 
were AJCC/UICC stage I-II and 82% were stage III-IV. The most common biomarkers 
were proteins (39%), DNA (14%) and mRNA (9%). Limiting analysis to prospective 
data and statistically significant results, we found three potentially druggable 
targets: ERCC2, PTCH1 and EGFR. Regarding data quality, AJCC/UICC stage was 
missing in 32% of manuscripts. 73% of studies were retrospective and only 7% 
were based on prospective randomized trials. Z-curves indicated the presence of 
publication bias. Conclusion: An abundance of potential biomarkers in HNSCC is 
available but data quality is limited by retrospective collection, lack of 
validation and publication bias. Improved study design and reporting quality 
might accelerate successful development of personalized treatments in HNSCC."
2131,"Multiple tumor exacerbations and treatment procedures, such as extracellular 
matrix remodeling, metabolic reprogramming, immunological evasion, and 
resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are influenced by intratumoral 
hypoxia. It is becoming increasingly clear how hypoxia interacts with the 
extracellular matrix and how this affects the growth of cancer. We analyzed the 
published sequencing results of hypoxia-stressed mouse kidney tumor cells and 
found that the expression of miR-29b was significantly downregulated. There are 
several sites that are complementary to the miR-29 seed sequence in the 3' 
non-coding regions (3'UTRs) of various extracellular matrix-related genes, 
including collagen IV. We analyzed the sequences of the 3'UTRs of different 
subunits of collagen IV in different species and constructed the corresponding 
phylogenetic trees. We found that the 3'UTRs of Col4a1 and Col4a4 may have been 
subjected to particular evolutionary pressures. By cloning the 3'UTRs of 
collagen IV subunits into the psiCHECKTM-2 vector, we found that seven of the 
eight sites in the Col4a3-Col4a6 gene complementary to miR-29 were significantly 
repressed by miR-29a, b (except for the 7774-7781 of Col4a3 gene). The 
inhibitory efficiency of miR-29a, b on these seven sites was between 27% and 
57%. The research on the regulation of miR-29 and extracellular matrix by 
hypoxia can provide a theoretical basis for tumor and fibrosis research and 
treatment."
2132,"The invasion and integrin-dependent adhesion of neutrophils to lung tissues and 
their secretion lead to the development of pneumonia in various pulmonary 
pathologies, including acute respiratory distress syndrome in coronavirus 
disease. We studied the effect of ivermectin, a possible therapeutic agent for 
inflammation and cancer, on integrin-dependent neutrophil adhesion to 
fibronectin and the concomitant secretion. Ivermectin did not affect the 
attachment of neutrophils to the substrate and the reactive oxygen species 
production but sharply inhibited the adhesion-induced release of hydroxylysine 
and stimulated the release of phenylalanine and cathepsin G. Hydroxylysine is a 
product of lysyl hydroxylase, which is overexpressed in tumor cells with an 
increased ability to invade and metastasize. The inhibition of hydroxylysine 
release by ivermectin, by analogy, may indicate the suppression of neutrophil 
invasion into tissue. The increase in the release of phenylalanine in our 
experiments coincided with the secretion of cathepsin G, which indicates the 
possible role of this enzyme in the cleavage of phenylalanine. What is the 
substrate in such a reaction is unknown. We demonstrated that exogenously added 
angiotensin II (1-8) can serve as a substrate for phenylalanine cleavage. Mass 
spectrometry revealed the formation of angiotensin II (1-7) in the secretion of 
neutrophils, which attached to fibronectin in the presence of ivermectin and 
exogenous angiotensin II (1-8), indicating a possible involvement of ivermectin 
in the inactivation of angiotensin II."
2133,"The prognosis, metastasis, and behavior of head and neck squamous cancer cells 
are influenced by numerous factors concerning the tumor microenvironment, 
intercellular communication, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The 
aim of this study was to examine the codependent interaction of the mesenchymal 
stroma with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in a 3D spheroid 
structure. To simulate stroma-rich and -poor 3D tumor microenvironments, cells 
of the established cell SCC-040 were cultured with human mesenchymal stromal 
cells (MSCs), forming 3D stroma-tumor spheroids (STSs). STSs were compared to 
uniform spheroids of SCC-040 and MSC, respectively. The expressions of CD24, 
β-catenin, SNAI2, and ZEB2 were analyzed via RT-qPCR. The immunohistochemical 
expressions of E-cadherin, connexin 43, vimentin, and emmprin were analyzed, and 
protein expression pathways as well as Akt signaling were assessed via protein 
analysis. A promotive effect on the expressions of EMT markers ZEB2 (p = 
0.0099), SNAI2 (p = 0.0352), and β-catenin (p = 0.0031) was demonstrated in 
STSs, as was the expression of Akt pathway proteins mTOR (p = 0.007), Erk1/2 (p 
= 0.0045), and p70 S6 Kinase (p = 0.0016). Our study demonstrated a change in 
genetic expression patterns early on in tumor development, indicating a tumor 
turning point."
2134,"LINE L1 are transposable elements that can replicate within the genome by 
passing through RNA intermediates. The vast majority of these element copies in 
the human genome are inactive and just between 100 and 150 copies are still able 
to mobilize. During evolution, they could have been positively selected for 
beneficial cellular functions. Nonetheless, L1 deregulation can be detrimental 
to the cell, causing diseases such as cancer. The activity of miRNAs represents 
a fundamental mechanism for controlling transcript levels in somatic cells. 
These are a class of small non-coding RNAs that cause degradation or 
translational inhibition of their target transcripts. Beyond this, competitive 
endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), mostly made by circular and non-coding RNAs, have been 
seen to compete for the binding of the same set of miRNAs targeting protein 
coding genes. In this study, we have investigated whether autonomously 
transcribed L1s may act as ceRNAs by analyzing public dataset in-silico. We 
observed that genes sharing miRNA target sites with L1 have a tendency to be 
upregulated when L1 are overexpressed, suggesting the possibility that L1 might 
act as ceRNAs. This finding will help in the interpretation of transcriptomic 
responses in contexts characterized by the specific activation of transposons."
2135,"Inherited cancer predisposition genes are described as risk factors in head and 
neck cancer (HNC) families. To explore the clinical and epidemiological data and 
their association with a family history of cancer, we recruited 74 patients and 
164 relatives affected by cancer. The germline copy number alterations were 
evaluated in 18 patients using array comparative genomic hybridization. Two or 
more first-degree relatives with HNC, tobacco-associated tumor sites (lung, 
esophagus, and pancreas), or other related tumors (breast, colon, kidney, 
bladder, cervix, stomach carcinomas, and melanoma) were reported in 74 families. 
Ten index patients had no exposure to any known risk factors. Family members 
presented tumors of 19 topographies (30 head and neck, 26 breast, 21 colon). In 
first-degree relatives, siblings were frequently affected by cancer (n = 58, 13 
had HNC). Breast cancer (n = 21), HNC (n = 19), and uterine carcinoma (n = 15) 
were commonly found in first-degree relatives and HNC in second-degree relatives 
(n = 11). Nineteen germline genomic imbalances were detected in 13 patients; 
three presented gains of WRD genes. The number of HNC patients, the degree of 
kinship, and the tumor types detected in each relative support the role of 
heredity in these families. Germline alterations may potentially contribute to 
cancer development."
2136,"Although we are lately witnessing major improvements in breast cancer treatment 
and patient outcomes, there is still a significant proportion of patients not 
receiving efficient therapy. More precisely, patients with triple-negative 
breast cancer or any type of metastatic disease. Currently available prognostic 
and therapeutic biomarkers are not always applicable and oftentimes lack 
precision. The science of glycans is a relatively new scientific approach to 
better characterize malignant transformation and tumor progression. In this 
review, we summarize the most important information about glycosylation 
characteristics in breast cancer cells and how different glycoproteins and 
enzymes involved in glycosylation could serve as more precise biomarkers, as 
well as new therapeutic targets."
2137,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and one of the leading causes of 
cancer mortality in males. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective 
strategy to inhibit tumour growth at early stages. However, 10~50% of cases are 
estimated to progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
which currently lacks effective treatments. Clinically, salvage treatment 
measures, such as endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, are mostly used for 
advanced prostate cancer, but their clinical outcomes are not ideal. When the 
existing clinical therapeutic methods can no longer inhibit the development of 
advanced prostate cancer, human adenovirus (HAdV)-based gene therapy and viral 
therapy present promising effects. Pre-clinical studies have shown its powerful 
oncolytic effect, and clinical studies are ongoing to further verify its effect 
and safety in prostate cancer treatment. Targeting the prostate by HAdV alone or 
in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy sheds light on patients with 
castration-resistant and advanced prostate cancer. This review summarizes the 
advantages of oncolytic virus-mediated cancer therapy, strategies of HAdV 
modification, and existing preclinical and clinical investigations of 
HAdV-mediated gene therapy to further evaluate the potential of oncolytic 
adenovirus in prostate cancer treatment."
2138,"Vasa previa is a rare fetal life-threatening obstetric disease classified into 
types I and II. This study aimed to examine the characteristics and obstetric 
outcomes of type II vasa previa. A systematic review was performed, and 20 
studies (1998-2022) were identified. The results from six studies showed that 
type II vasa previa accounted for 21.3% of vasa previa cases. The 
characteristics and obstetric outcomes (rate of assisted reproductive technology 
(ART), antenatal diagnosis, emergent cesarean delivery, maternal transfusion, 
gestational age at delivery, and neonatal mortality) were compared between type 
I and II vasa previa, and all outcomes of interest were similar. The association 
between ART and abnormal placenta (bilobed placenta or succenturiate lobe) was 
examined in three studies, and the results were as follows: (i) increased rate 
of succenturiate lobes (ART versus non-ART pregnancy; OR (odds ratio) 6.97, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) 2.45-19.78); (ii) similar rate of abnormal placenta 
(cleavage-stage versus blastocyst embryo transfer); (iii) increased rate of 
abnormal placenta (frozen versus fresh embryo transfer; OR 2.97, 95%CI 
1.10-7.96). Although the outcomes of type II vasa previa appear to be similar to 
those of type I vasa previa, the current evidence is insufficient for a robust 
conclusion."
2139,"Pyrvinium, a lipophilic cation belonging to the cyanine dye family, has been 
used in the clinic as a safe and effective anthelminthic for over 70 years. Its 
structure, similar to some polyaminopyrimidines and mitochondrial-targeting 
peptoids, has been linked with mitochondrial localization and targeting. Over 
the past two decades, increasing evidence has emerged showing pyrvinium to be a 
strong anti-cancer molecule in various human cancers in vitro and in vivo. This 
efficacy against cancers has been attributed to diverse mechanisms of action, 
with the weight of evidence supporting the inhibition of mitochondrial function, 
the WNT pathway, and cancer stem cell renewal. Despite the overwhelming evidence 
demonstrating the efficacy of pyrvinium for the treatment of human cancers, 
pyrvinium has not yet been repurposed for the treatment of cancers. This review 
provides an in-depth analysis of the history of pyrvinium as a therapeutic, the 
rationale and data supporting its use as an anticancer agent, and the challenges 
associated with repurposing pyrvinium as an anti-cancer agent."
2140,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (nCRT) represents the standard of 
care for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC); however, there exists no 
biomarker that can predict the cancer's response to treatment as less than 20% 
of patients experience pathological complete response (pCR). Ionizing radiations 
induce double strand breaks (DSBs) and trigger a DNA damage response (DDR) 
involving ATM, ATR, and the MRN complex (MRE11, Rad50, and NBS1). In this study, 
we performed an extensive mutational analysis of the genes involved in the DDR 
pathway in LARC patients who have undergone nCRT.
METHODS: 13 LARC patients with pCR and 11 LARC patients with partial response 
(pPR) were investigated using a NGS dedicated panel, designed for formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, containing ATR, ATM, and MRE11-RAD50-NBN 
genes. The identified variants were classified according to guidelines' 
recommendations.
RESULTS: Eight non-benign variants, six of which were observed in 3 (23%) out of 
13 pCR patients, were identified. In particular, a pCR patient carried out a 
pathogenetic frameshift mutation in exon 21 of the RAD50 gene. The two remaining 
non-benign missense variants were found in 2 (18%) out of 11 patients in the pPR 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the genes involved in the Homologous 
Recombination (HR) pathway are rarely mutated in LARC; however, given the 
identification of a missense mutation in RAD 50 in one case of pCR, it could be 
worth exploring its potential role as a biomarker in larger series."
2141,"The expression and cellular mechanisms of programmed cell death-1 protein (PD-1) 
and its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) in renal cancer cells are not well known. 
Here, we aimed to investigate the response of renal carcinoma subtypes to the 
immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab and its impact on related signaling 
pathways. All cell lines analyzed (clear cell (cc)RCC (Caki-1, RCC31) and 
papillary (p)RCC (ACHN, RCC30)) expressed PD-1 and both ccRCC cell lines, and 
RCC30 expressed PD-L1. Nivolumab treatment at increasing doses led to increased 
PD-1 levels in analyzed cells and resulted in aggressive behavior of pRCC but 
diminished this behavior in ccRCC. The analysis of PD-1/PD-L1-associated 
signaling pathways demonstrated increased AKT activity in Caki-1 and RCC30 cells 
but decreased activity in ACHN and RCC31 cells, while ribosomal protein S6 
remained largely unchanged. Androgen receptors are related to RCC and were 
predominantly increased in RCC30 cells, which were the only cells that formed 
nivolumab-dependent spheroids. Finally, all cell lines exhibited a complex 
response to nivolumab treatment. Since the pRCC cells responded with increased 
tumorigenicity and PD-1/PD-L1 levels while ccRCC tumorigenicity was diminished, 
further studies are needed to improve nivolumab-based therapy for renal 
carcinoma subtypes, especially the identification of response-involved molecular 
pathways."
2142,"The synucleins are a family of natively unfolded (or intrinsically unstructured) 
proteins consisting of α-, β-, and γ-synuclein involved in neurodegenerative 
diseases and cancer. The current number of publications on synucleins has 
exceeded 16.000. They remain the subject of constant interest for over 35 years. 
Two reasons explain this unchanging attention: synuclein's association with 
several severe human diseases and the lack of understanding of the functional 
roles under normal physiological conditions. We analyzed recent publications to 
look at the main trends and developments in synuclein research and discuss 
possible future directions. Traditional areas of peak research interest which 
still remain high among last year's publications are comparative studies of 
structural features as well as functional research on of three members of the 
synuclein family. Another popular research topic in the area is a mechanism of 
α-synuclein accumulation, aggregation, and fibrillation. Exciting fast-growing 
area of recent research is α-synuclein and epigenetics. We do not present here a 
broad and comprehensive review of all directions of studies but summarize only 
the most significant recent findings relevant to these topics and outline 
potential future directions."
2143,"There is a growing number of multi-domain genomic datasets for human tumors. 
Multi-domain data are usually interpreted after separately analyzing 
single-domain data and integrating the results post hoc. Data fusion techniques 
allow for the real integration of multi-domain data to ideally improve the tumor 
classification results for the prognosis and prediction of response to therapy. 
We have previously described the joint singular value decomposition (jSVD) 
technique as a means of data fusion. Here, we report on the development of these 
methods in open source code based on R and Python and on the application of 
these data fusion methods. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Skin Cutaneous 
Melanoma (SKCM) dataset was used as a benchmark to evaluate the potential of the 
data fusion approaches to improve molecular classification of cancers in a 
clinically relevant manner. Our data show that the data fusion approach does not 
generate classification results superior to those obtained using single-domain 
data. Data from different domains are not entirely independent from each other, 
and molecular classes are characterized by features that penetrate different 
domains. Data fusion techniques might be better suited for response prediction, 
where they could contribute to the identification of predictive features in a 
domain-independent manner to be used as biomarkers."
2144,"(1) Background: T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) is a potential 
immunotherapeutic target in a variety of malignant entities, and antibody-based 
treatments are currently under investigation in clinical trials. While promising 
results were observed in patients with lung cancer, the role of TIGIT in oral 
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as a biomarker as well as a therapeutic target 
remains elusive. Therefore, we evaluated the role of TIGIT as a prognostic 
factor in OSCC. (2) Methods: Here, we describe the results of a retrospective 
tissue microarray (TMA) OSCC cohort. Using immunohistochemistry, TIGIT 
expression was correlated with overall and recurrence-free survival (OAS and 
RFS, respectively). Additionally, in silico analysis was performed based on the 
TCGA Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) cohort in order to correlate 
patients' survival with TIGIT and CD274 (encoding for PD-L1) gene expression 
levels. (3) Results: Database analysis revealed a beneficial outcome in OAS for 
tumor patients with high intraepithelial CD3-TIGIT-expression (n = 327). Hereby, 
OAS was 53.9 months vs. 30.1 months for patients with lower TIGIT gene 
expression levels (p = 0.033). In our retrospective OSCC-TMA cohort, elevated 
TIGIT levels on CD3+ cells correlated significantly with improved OAS (p = 
0.025) as well as distant RFS (p = 0.026). (4) Conclusions: This study 
introduces TIGIT as a novel prognostic factor in OSCC, indicating the improved 
outcome of OSCC patients relative to their increased TIGIT expression. TIGIT 
might provide therapeutic implications for future immunotherapy in 
advanced-stage OSCC patients."
2145,"Rhinosinusitis is common in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Our 
study aimed to explore the role of rhinosinusitis severity in NPC prognosis. 
Medical records and radiologic examinations of 90 patients with NPC at a single 
medical center from 2009-2016 were retrospectively analyzed. The Lund-Mackay 
(L-M) score was obtained for each patient before and after 6 months of 
treatment. Rhinosinusitis diagnosis was based on L-M scores of ≥4. L-M score 
differences were calculated as pre-treatment rhinosinusitis (PRRS) minus 
post-treatment rhinosinusitis (PSRS). L-M score difference was sub-grouped into 
""L-M scores &gt; 0"", ""L-M scores = 0"", and ""L-M scores &lt; 0"". Clinical staging 
of our patients based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition 
were: stage I in nine, stage II in seventeen, stage III in twenty-two, and stage 
IV in forty-two patients; twenty-seven (30%) patients had died. PRRS incidence 
was 34.4%, and PSRS was 36.7%. Median of L-M scores difference was 0 (-2.2). L-M 
score difference was an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival 
of patients with NPC (p &lt; 0.05). Therefore, worsening rhinosinusitis was a 
prognostic factor for patients with NPC. Clinicians should consider NPC as a 
warning sign of poor prognosis during routine follow-ups."
2146,"Disease and treatment-related symptoms and dysfunctions can interfere with the 
psychosocial adjustment of patients with oral cancer. Identifying factors 
influencing psychosocial maladjustment is important because at-risk individuals 
can be targeted for early intervention. This prospective longitudinal study 
investigated psychosocial adjustment changes and associated factors in 
postoperative oral cancer patients. Data on psychosocial adjustment, facial 
disfigurement, symptoms, and social support were collected before surgery (T1) 
at one month (T2), three months (T3), and five months after discharge (T4). 
Fifty subjects completed the study, and their data were included in the 
analysis. Psychosocial maladjustment was reported in 50%, 59.2%, 66%, and 62% of 
subjects at T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively. The subjects' psychosocial 
adjustment deteriorated after surgery. Results from generalized estimating 
equations indicated that financial status, cancer stage, pain, speech problems, 
social eating problems, and less sexuality were significant predictors of 
changes in psychosocial adjustment. Patients with insufficient income, stage 
III/IV cancer, severe pain, speech problems, social eating problems, and less 
sexuality were at higher risk for postoperative psychosocial maladjustment. 
Continued psychosocial assessment and appropriate supportive measures are needed 
to strengthen the psychosocial adjustment of these high-risk groups."
2147,"PURPOSE: Breast arterial calcifications (BAC) have been associated with 
cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to examine whether the presence of BAC could 
predict the development of cardiovascular events in the very long term, as 
evidence has suggested.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a 23-year follow-up retrospective cohort 
study considering women specifically studied for breast cancer. After reviewing 
the mammograms of 1759 women, we selected 128 patients with BAC and an equal 
number of women without BAC.
RESULTS: Women with BAC had higher relative risk (RR) for cardiovascular events, 
globally 1.66 (95% CI): 1.31-2.10 vs. 0.53 (0.39-0.72), and individually for 
ischemic heart disease 3.25 (1.53-6.90) vs. 0.85 (0.77-0.94), hypertensive heart 
disease 2.85 (1.59-5.09) vs. 0.79 (0.69-0.89), valvular heart disease 2.19 
(1.28-3.75) vs. 0.83 (0.73-0.94), congestive heart failure 2.06 (1.19-3.56) vs. 
0.85 (0.75-0.96), peripheral vascular disease 2.8 (1.42-5.52) vs. 0.85 
(0.76-0.94), atrial fibrillation 1.83 (1.09-3.08) vs. 0.86 (0.76-0.98), and 
lacunar infarction 2.23 (1.21-4.09) vs. 0.86 (0.77-0.96). Cox's multivariate 
analysis, also considering classical risk factors, indicated that this BAC was 
significantly and independently associated with survival (both cardiovascular 
event-free and specific survival; 1.94 (1.38-2.73) and 6.6 (2.4-18.4)).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the strong association of BAC on mammograms and 
the development cardiovascular events, but also evidence the association of BAC 
with cardiovascular event-free and specific survival."
2148,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a therapeutic challenge in 
clinical oncology. Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment. However, 
the majority of PDAC patients present with locally advanced/unresectable or 
metastatic disease, where palliative multiagent chemotherapy is the first-line 
treatment with the therapeutic intent to delay progression and prolong survival. 
For locally advanced/unresectable pancreatic cancer patients who are treated 
with chemotherapy, consolidative radiotherapy in the form concurrent 
chemoradiation or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy improves locoregional 
control and pain/symptom control. To improve clinical outcomes of PDAC patients, 
there is a dire need for discoveries that will shed more light on the 
pathophysiology of the disease and lead to the development of more efficacious 
treatment strategies. Inflammatory cytokines are known to play a role in 
mediating tumor progression, chemoresistance, and radioresistance in PDAC. A 
PubMed search on published articles related to radiotherapy, inflammatory 
cytokines, and pancreatic cancer patients in the English language was performed. 
This article primarily focuses on reviewing the clinical literature that 
examines the association of inflammatory cytokines with clinical outcomes and 
the effects of radiotherapy on inflammatory cytokines in PDAC patients."
2149,"The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of suppressive cells 
producing a variety of immunomodulatory proteins, such as programmed death 
ligand 1 (PD-L1) and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Although granzyme B 
(GrB) is known to convey the cytolytic activities of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes, 
it is also expressed by other cells, such as regulatory T and B cells, for 
immunosuppressive purposes. The role of GrB+ lymphocytes in melanoma has not 
been examined extensively. In this study, benign, premalignant, and malignant 
melanocytic tumors were stained immunohistochemically for CD8 and GrB. PD-L1 was 
also stained from malignant samples that had accompanying clinicopathological 
data. The association of CD8+ and GrB+ lymphocytes with PD-L1 expression, tumor 
stage, prognosis, and previously analyzed immunosuppressive factors were 
evaluated. Our aim was to obtain a more comprehensive perception of the 
immunosuppressive TME in melanoma. The results show that both CD8+ and GrB+ 
lymphocytes were more abundant in pT4 compared to pT1 melanomas, and in lymph 
node metastases compared to primary melanomas. Surprisingly, a low GrB/CD8 ratio 
was associated with better recurrence-free survival in primary melanomas, which 
indicates that GrB+ lymphocytes might represent activated immunosuppressive 
lymphocytes rather than cytotoxic T cells. In the present study, CD8+ 
lymphocytes associated positively with both tumor and stromal immune cell PD-L1 
and IDO expression. In addition, PD-L1+ tumor and stromal immune cells 
associated positively with IDO+ stromal immune and melanoma cells. The data 
suggest that IDO and PD-L1 seem to be key immunosuppressive factors in CD8+ 
lymphocyte-predominant tumors in CM."
2150,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. 
Hereditary CRC syndromes account for approximately 5-10% of all CRC, with a 
lifetime risk of CRC that approaches 50-80% in the absence of endoscopic or 
surgical treatment. Hereditary CRC syndromes can be phenotypically divided into 
polyposis and non-polyposis syndrome, mainly according to the conditions of 
polyps. The typical representatives are familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and 
Lynch syndromes (LS), respectively. Over the past few decades, molecular 
genetics enhanced the discovery of cancer-predisposing genes and revolutionized 
the field of clinical oncology. Hereditary CRC syndromes have been a key part of 
this effort, with data showing that pathogenic variants are present in up to 10% 
of cases. Molecular phenotypes of tumors can not only help identify individuals 
with genetic susceptibility to CRC but also guide the precision prevention and 
treatment for the development of CRC. This review emphasizes the molecular basis 
and prevention strategies for hereditary CRC syndromes."
2151,"Introduction-With the high global prevalence of prostate cancer and associated 
mortalities, it is important to enhance current clinical practices for better 
prostate cancer outcomes. The current review is towards understanding the value 
of Zn towards this mission. Method-General information on Zn in biology and 
multiple aspects of Zn involvement in prostate health and disease were referred 
to in PubMed. Results-The most influential feature of Zn towards prostate health 
is its ability to retain sufficient citrate levels for a healthy prostate. Zn 
deficiencies were recorded in serum, hair, and prostate tissue of men with 
prostate cancer compared to non-cancer controls. Zn gut absorption, albumin 
binding, and storage compete with various factors. There are multiple 
associations of Zn cellular influx and efflux transporters, Zn finger proteins, 
matrix metalloproteinases, and Zn signaling with prostate cancer outcomes. Such 
Zn marker variations associated with prostate cancer recorded from biological 
matrices may improve algorithms for prostate cancer screening, prognosis, and 
management when coupled with standard clinical practices. Discussion-The 
influence of Zn in prostatic health and disease is multidimensional, therefore 
more personalized Zn requirements may be beneficial. Several opportunities exist 
to utilize and improve understanding of Zn associations with prostate health and 
disease."
2152,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent liver cancer with high 
lethality and low five-year survival rates leading to a substantial worldwide 
burden for healthcare systems. HCC initiation and progression are favored by 
different etiological risk factors including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, non-/and alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(N/AFLD), and tobacco smoking. In molecular pathogenesis, endogenous alteration 
in genetics (TP53, TERT, CTNNB1, etc.), epigenetics (DNA-methylation, miRNA, 
lncRNA, etc.), and dysregulation of key signaling pathways (Wnt/β-catenin, 
JAK/STAT, etc.) strongly contribute to the development of HCC. The multitude and 
complexity of different pathomechanisms also reflect the difficulties in 
tailored medical therapy of HCC. Treatment options for HCC are strictly 
dependent on tumor staging and liver function, which are structured by the 
updated Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification system. Surgical resection, 
local ablative techniques, and liver transplantation are valid and curative 
therapeutic options for early tumor stages. For multifocal and metastatic 
diseases, systemic therapy is recommended. While Sorafenib had been the 
standalone HCC first-line therapy for decades, recent developments had led to 
the approval of new treatment options as first-line as well as second-line 
treatment. Anti-PD-L1 directed combination therapies either with anti-VEGF 
directed agents or with anti-CTLA-4 active substances have been implemented as 
the new treatment standard in the first-line setting. However, data from 
clinical trials indicate different responses on specific therapeutic regimens 
depending on the underlying pathogenesis of hepatocellular cancer. Therefore, 
histopathological examinations have been re-emphasized by current international 
clinical guidelines in addition to the standardized radiological diagnosis using 
contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging. In this review, we emphasize the 
current knowledge on molecular pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. On this 
occasion, the treatment sequences for early and advanced tumor stages according 
to the recently updated Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification system and 
the current algorithm of systemic therapy (first-, second-, and third-line 
treatment) are summarized. Furthermore, we discuss novel precautional and 
pre-therapeutic approaches including therapeutic vaccination, adoptive cell 
transfer, locoregional therapy enhancement, and non-coding RNA-based therapy as 
promising treatment options. These novel treatments may prolong overall survival 
rates in regard with quality of life and liver function as mainstay of HCC 
therapy."
2153,"The safety profile of hydroxyurea (HU) in patients with sickle-cell disease 
(SCD) is relatively well known. However, despite the suspected association of HU 
with myeloid neoplasms in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and the 
publication of sporadic reports of myeloid malignancies in SCD patients treated 
with HU, the possible excess risk imparted by HU in this population having an 
increasing life expectancy has failed to be demonstrated. Herein, we report one 
case of myelodysplastic syndrome emanating from the results on safety and 
effectiveness of HU on the largest European cohort of 1903 HU-treated adults and 
children who were followed-up prospectively in an observational setting over 10 
years, accounting for a total exposure of 7309.5 patient-years. A comparison of 
this single case with previously published similar cases did not allow us to 
draw any significant conclusions due to the paucity of these events."
2154,"Pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer-related mortality in 
both sexes across the globe. It is associated with extremely poor prognosis and 
remains a critical burden worldwide due to its low survival rates. 
Histologically, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for 80% of all 
pancreatic cancers; the majority of which are diagnosed at advanced stages, 
which makes them ineligible for curative surgery. Conventional chemotherapy 
provides a five-year overall survival rate of less than 8% forcing scientists 
and clinicians to search for better treatment strategies. Recent discoveries in 
cancer immunology have resulted in the incorporation of immunotherapeutic 
strategies for cancer treatment. Particularly, immune-checkpoint inhibitors, 
adoptive cell therapies and cancer vaccines have already shifted guidelines for 
some malignancies, although their efficacy in PDAC has yet to be elucidated. In 
this review, we summarize the existing clinical data on immunotherapy clinical 
outcomes in patients with advanced or metastatic PDAC."
2155,"BACKGROUND: Gain-of-function mutations in CARD14 have recently been shown to be 
involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP). 
Those mutations were found to activate the NF-kB signaling pathway.
OBJECTIVE: Zebrafish is often used to model human diseases in general, and in 
skin disorders more particularly. In the present study, we aimed to examine the 
effect of CARD14 overexpression in zebrafish with the aim to validate this model 
for future translational applications.
METHODS: We used light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, histological 
analysis and whole mount in situ hybridization as well as real-time PCR to 
ascertain the effect of CARD14 overexpression in the developing zebrafish.
RESULTS: Overexpression of human CARD14 had a marked morphological and 
developmental effect on the embryos. Light microscopy demonstrated a 
characteristic cutaneous pattern including a granular surface and a spiky 
pigment pattern. In situ hybridization revealed keratinocytes of uneven size and 
shape. Scanning electron microscopy showed aberrant production of actin 
microridges and a rugged keratinocyte cell surface, reminiscent of the human 
hyperkeratotic phenotype. Developmentally, overexpression of CARD14 had a 
variable effect on anterior-posterior axis symmetry. Similar to what has been 
observed in humans with psoriasis or PRP, NF-kB expression was higher in 
CARD14-overexpressing embryos compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of CARD14 results in a distinct cutaneous pattern 
accompanied by hyperactivation of the NF-kB pathway, suggesting that the 
zebrafish represents a useful system to model CARD14-associated papulosquamous 
diseases."
2156,"A highly specific AXL-receptor targeted family of non-immunoglobulin, single 
domain protein binders (Pronectins™) have been isolated from three (3) synthetic 
libraries that employ the human scaffold of the 14th domain of Fibronectin III 
(14FN3) and evolutionary CDRs diversity of over 25 billion loop sequences. The 
three libraries, each containing diversity in two loops, were designed to expand 
upon a human database of more than 6000 natural scaffold sequences and 
approximately 3000 human loop sequences. We used a bioinformatic-based approach 
to maximize ""human"" amino acid loop diversity and minimize or prevent altogether 
CDR immunogenicity created by the use of mutagenesis processes to generate 
diversity. A combination of phage display and yeast display was used to isolate 
59 AXL receptor targeted Pronectins with KD ranging between 2 and 100 nM. FACS 
analysis with tumor cells over-expressing AXL and the use of an AXL knock-out 
cell line allowed us to identify Pronectin candidates with exquisite specificity 
for AXL receptor. Based upon several in vitro cell-based tests, we selected the 
best candidate, AXL54, to further characterize its in vitro cancer cells killing 
activity. Finally, AXL54 was used to produce the first bi-specific T cell 
engager protein (AXL54 [Pronectin]-linker-scFV CD3), a ""new in class"" protein 
for further testing of its anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo."
2157,"Locally invasive papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) protrudes beyond the thyroid 
capsule and invades local structures. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their 
inhibitors (TIMPs) are implicated in local invasion and metastasis in PTC. The 
aim of our study was to determine expression levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, 
TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 in tissue specimens of invasive and non-invasive PTC. Our 
hypothesis was that expression levels of these biomarkers correlate with the 
development of locally invasive PTC. In our single-center study we 
retrospectively investigated MMP and TIMP expression levels in 50 samples of 
thyroid tissue diagnosed as locally invasive papillary carcinoma (study group) 
and 30 samples of thyroid tissue diagnosed as non-invasive, non-metastatic 
papillary carcinoma (control group). Tissue specimens were immunohistochemically 
stained with primary monoclonal antibodies against MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, 
and TIMP-2. When correlating expression levels of MMPs and TIMPs in thyroid 
tissue, statistically significant differences were found for MMP-1 and TIMP-1 
expression (p &lt; 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test) with the highest levels of 
expression in the invasive PTC group. Although expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-2 
was higher in invasive PTC, the differences were not statistically significant. 
Elevated expression of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 in tumor tissue can predict invasiveness 
for PTC."
2158,"BACKGROUND: With anti-inflammatory properties, cannabinoids may be a potential 
strategy to reduce immune activation in people living with HIV (PLWH) but more 
information on their safety and tolerability is needed.
METHODS: We conducted an open-label interventional pilot study at the McGill 
University Health Centre in Montreal, Canada. PLWH were randomized to oral 
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC): cannabidiol (CBD) combination (THC 2.5 mg/CBD 2.5 
mg) or CBD-only capsules (CBD 200 mg). Individuals titrated doses as tolerated 
to a maximum daily dose THC 15 mg/CBD 15 mg or 800 mg CBD, respectively, for 12 
weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants without any 
significant toxicity based on the WHO toxicity scale (Grades 0-2 scores).
RESULTS: Out of ten individuals, eight completed the study. Two from the 
CBD-only arm were withdrawn for safety concerns: phlebotomy aggravating 
pre-existing anemia and severe hepatitis on 800 mg CBD with newly discovered 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma, respectively. Seven did not have any significant 
toxicity. Cannabinoids did not alter hematology/biochemistry profiles. CD4 
count, CD4/CD8 ratio, and HIV suppression remained stable. Most adverse effects 
were mild-moderate.
CONCLUSIONS: In PLWH, cannabinoids seem generally safe and well-tolerated, 
though larger studies are needed. Screening for occult liver pathology should be 
performed and hepatic enzymes monitored, especially with high CBD doses."
2159,"BACKGROUND: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are approved for 
patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer harboring 
deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA1 and/or 2 mutations. Identifying 
patients with prostate cancer harboring these mutations may be challenging. 
Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) provides an avenue for an easier detection of 
these mutations. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the concordance of BRCA mutations 
in the tumor tissue and cfDNA in patients with metastatic prostate cancer in the 
real-world setting.
METHODS: Somatic genomic profiling results were obtained from a clinical cohort 
of patients at our institution who had at least two samples tested. One of the 
samples needed to be from either primary or metastatic tissue. Concordance was 
adjusted to not include mutation types that the cfDNA platforms were not 
designed to detect.
RESULTS: The presence or absence of mutations in the BRCA gene was assessed in a 
total of 589 samples, including 327 cfDNA samples, from 260 patients with 
metastatic prostate cancer. The median time between the first test and any 
subsequent test was 22.8 (0.0-232) months. BRCA mutation was present in the 
patient's original prostate tissue in 23 samples (3.9%) of patients. The 
adjusted concordance between prostate tumor tissue and cfDNA was 97.9% [95% CI, 
95.3-99.1%]. The adjusted concordance between metastatic samples and cfDNA was 
93.5% [95% CI, 86.4-97.3%]. Of the patients who had a BRCA mutation detected in 
their prostate tissue, there was a 70% probability of detecting a BRCA mutation 
in the patient's cfDNA as well. For patients who did not have a detectable BRCA 
mutation in their primary prostate tissue, the probability of detecting a 
subsequent one later in the disease course was less than 0.9%.
CONCLUSION: There is a high level of concordance between tissue and blood for 
BRCA mutations. Testing cfDNA can provide reliable information on BRCA 
mutational status and is a viable alternative to solid tissue sequencing when 
unavailable. The development of a new BRCA mutation later in the disease course 
is a rare event."
2160,"BACKGROUND: A critical unmet medical need in clinical management of colorectal 
cancer (CRC) pivots around lack of noninvasive and or minimally invasive 
techniques for early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of clinical outcomes. 
Because DNA methylation can capture the regulatory landscape of tumors and can 
be measured in body fluids, it provides unparalleled opportunities for the 
discovery of early diagnostic and prognostics markers predictive of clinical 
outcomes. Here we investigated use of DNA methylation for the discovery of 
potential clinically actionable diagnostic and prognostic markers for predicting 
survival in CRC.
METHODS: We analyzed DNA methylation patterns between tumor and control samples 
to discover signatures of CpG sites and genes associated with CRC and predictive 
of survival. We conducted functional analysis to identify molecular networks and 
signaling pathways driving clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We discovered a signature of aberrantly methylated genes associated 
with CRC and a signature of thirteen (13) CpG sites predictive of survival. We 
discovered molecular networks and signaling pathways enriched for CpG sites 
likely to drive clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The investigation revealed that CpG sites can predict survival in 
CRC and that DNA methylation can capture the regulatory state of tumors through 
aberrantly methylated molecular networks and signaling pathways."
2161,"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, a burgeoning type of the 
innate-like T cells, play a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis, 
particularly in host defense. Although many studies have implied the use of MAIT 
cells in tumor immunity, whether MAIT cells are pro-tumor or anti-tumor has 
remained elusive, as in the case for other innate-like T cells that possess 
dichotomous roles in tumor immunity. Although this difficulty persists where 
endogenous MAIT cells are the target for therapeutic intervention, the advent of 
induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived MAIT cells (reMAIT cells) will make it 
possible to harness these cells for immune cell therapy. In this review, we will 
discuss possible roles of MAIT cells in tumor immunity and the potential of 
reMAIT cells to treat tumors."
2162,"Multiple tumors have responded well to immunotherapies, which use monoclonal 
antibodies to block the immune checkpoint proteins and reactivate the T-cell 
immune response to cancer cells. Significantly, the anti-PD-1 antibodies 
pembrolizumab and nivolumab, which were approved in 2014, have revolutionized 
cancer therapy, demonstrating dramatic improvement and longer duration. The US 
FDA authorized the third anti-PD-1 medication, cemiplimab, in 2018 for use in 
patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. To further understand the 
molecular mechanism of the antibody drug, we now reveal the intricate structure 
of PD-1 in complex with the cemiplimab Fab at a resolution of 1.98 Å. The 
cemiplimab-PD-1 interaction preoccupies the space for PD-L1 binding with a 
greater binding affinity than the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, which is the basis for 
the PD-1 blocking mechanism. The structure reveals that cemiplimab and 
dostarlimab are significantly similar in PD-1 binding, although the precise 
interactions differ. A comparative investigation of PD-1 interactions with the 
four FDA-approved antibodies reveals that the BC, C'D, and FG loops of PD-1 
adopt distinct conformations for optimal interaction with the antibodies. The 
structural characteristics in this work could be helpful information for 
developing more potent anti-PD-1 biologics against cancer."
2163,"Targeted liposomes triggered by ultrasound are a promising drug delivery system 
as they potentially improve the clinical outcomes of chemotherapy while reducing 
associated side effects. In this work, a comprehensive model fitting was 
performed for a large dataset of liposomal release profiles with seven targeting 
moieties (albumin, cRGD, estrone, hyaluronic acid, Herceptin, lactobionic acid, 
and transferrin) in addition to the control liposomes under ultrasound release 
protocols. Two levels of ultrasound frequencies were tested: low frequency (20 
kHz) at 6.2, 9, and 10 mW/cm2 as well as high frequencies (1.07 MHz and 3 MHz) 
at 10.5 and 173 W/cm2. At a low frequency, Hixson-Crowell, Korsmeyer-Peppas, 
Gompertz, Weibull, and Lu-Hagen showed good fits to our release profiles at all 
three power densities. At high frequencies, the former three models reflected 
the best fit. These models will aid in predicting drug release profiles for 
future in vitro studies."
2164,"Engineered magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are emerging as advanced tools for 
medical applications. The coating of MNPs using polyelectrolytes (PEs) is a 
versatile means to tailor MNP properties and is used to optimize MNP 
functionality. Dendritic cells (DCs) are critical regulators of adaptive immune 
responses. Functionally distinct DC subsets exist, either under steady-state or 
inflammatory conditions, which are explored for the specific treatment of 
various diseases, such as cancer, autoimmunity, and transplant rejection. Here, 
the impact of the PE coating of ferumoxytol for uptake into both inflammatory 
and steady-state DCs and the cellular responses to MNP labeling is addressed. 
Labeling efficiency by uncoated and PE-coated ferumoxytol is highly variable in 
different DC subsets, and PE coating significantly improves the labeling of 
steady-state DCs. Uncoated ferumoxytol results in increased cytotoxicity of 
steady-state DCs after labeling, which is abolished by the PE coating, while no 
increased cell death is observed in inflammatory DCs. Furthermore, uncoated and 
PE-coated ferumoxytol appear immunologically inert in inflammatory DCs, but they 
induce activation of steady-state DCs. These results show that the PE coating of 
MNPs can be applied to endow particles with desired properties for enhanced 
uptake and cell type-specific responses in distinct target DC populations."
2165,"Autologous platelet concentrates, like liquid platelet rich fibrin (iPRF), 
optimize wound healing; however, the underlying immunological mechanisms are 
poorly understood. Platelets, the main cellular component of iPRF, highly 
express the protein, Glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP), on their 
surfaces. GARP plays a crucial role in maintaining peripheral tolerance, but its 
influence on the immune capacity of iPRF remains unclear. This study analyzed 
the interaction of iPRF with immune cells implicated in the wound healing 
process (human monocyte derived macrophages and CD4+ T cells) and evaluated the 
distinct influence of GARP on these mechanisms in vitro. GARP was determined to 
be expressed on the surface of platelets and to exist as a soluble factor in 
iPRF. Platelets derived from iPRF and iPRF itself induced a regulatory phenotype 
in CD4+ T cells, shown by increased expression of Foxp3 and GARP as well as 
decreased production of IL-2 and IFN-γ. Application of an anti-GARP antibody 
reversed these effects. Additionally, iPRF polarized macrophages to a 
""M0/M2-like"" phenotype in a GARP independent manner. Altogether, this study 
demonstrated for the first time that the immune capacity of iPRF is mediated in 
part by GARP and its ability to induce regulatory CD4+ T cells."
2166,"We previously established mouse models of biliary tract cancer (BTC) based on 
the injection of cells with biliary epithelial stem cell properties derived from 
KRAS(G12V)-expressing organoids into syngeneic mice. The resulting mouse tumors 
appeared to recapitulate the pathological features of human BTC. Here we 
analyzed images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for both the mouse tumor 
tissue and human cholangiocarcinoma tissue by pixel-level clustering with 
machine learning. A pixel-clustering model that was established via training 
with mouse images revealed homologies of tissue structure between the mouse and 
human tumors, suggesting similarities in tumor characteristics independent of 
animal species. Analysis of the human cholangiocarcinoma tissue samples with the 
model also revealed that the entropy distribution of cancer regions was higher 
than that of noncancer regions, with the entropy of pixels thus allowing 
discrimination between these two types of regions. Histograms of entropy tended 
to be broader for noncancer regions of late-stage human cholangiocarcinoma. 
These analyses indicate that our mouse BTC models are appropriate for 
investigation of BTC carcinogenesis and may support the development of new 
therapeutic strategies. In addition, our pixel-level clustering model is highly 
versatile and may contribute to the development of a new BTC diagnostic tool."
2167,"The use of a new bioinformatics pipeline allowed the identification of 
deregulated transcription factors (TFs) coexpressed in lung cancer that could 
become biomarkers of tumor establishment and progression. A gene regulatory 
network (GRN) of lung cancer was created with the normalized gene expression 
levels of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the microarray dataset 
GSE19804. Moreover, coregulatory and transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) 
analyses were performed for the main regulators identified in the GRN analysis. 
The gene targets and binding motifs of all potentially implicated regulators 
were identified in the TRN and with multiple alignments of the TFs' target gene 
sequences. Six transcription factors (E2F3, FHL2, ETS1, KAT6B, TWIST1, and 
RUNX2) were identified in the GRN as essential regulators of gene expression in 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and related to the lung tumoral process. Our 
findings indicate that RUNX2 could be an important regulator of the lung cancer 
GRN through the formation of coregulatory complexes with other TFs related to 
the establishment and progression of lung cancer. Therefore, RUNX2 could become 
an essential biomarker for developing diagnostic tools and specific treatments 
against tumoral diseases in the lung after the experimental validation of its 
regulatory function."
2168,"EMR1, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor family (ADGRE1), is a 
macrophage marker that is abnormally expressed in cancer cells. However, its 
clinical significance in colorectal cancer (CRC) is not well-known. In this 
investigation, EMR1 expression in tumor cells (EMR1-TC) was found in 91 (22.8%) 
of the 399 CRC samples tested by immunohistochemical staining and showed a 
significant relationship with lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, EMR1-TC was 
significantly associated with CD68+ CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), 
and CRC with a high combined EMR1-TC+CD68+CD163+ score showed worse 
recurrence-free survival prognosis. In an in vitro co-culture assay of colon 
cancer cells with myeloid cells, we found that EMR1 expression significantly 
upregulated in cancer cells was induced by macrophages. In addition, there was 
increased expression of M2 markers (CD163 and interleukin-6 & 10) in myeloid 
portion, while that of M1 markers (CD86 and iNOS) remained unchanged. 
Accordingly, upon treatment with M2 macrophage polarization inhibitors (O-ATP, 
trametinib, bardoxolone methyl), EMR1 expression reduced significantly, along 
with M2 markers (CD163 and interleukin-6 & 10). In conclusion, EMR1-TC was a 
high-risk factor for lymph node metastasis and correlated with poor recurrence 
free survival, particularly in patients with TAM-rich CRC. Furthermore, EMR1 
expression in colon cancer cells may be related to M2 macrophage polarization 
and vice versa."
2169,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer and the 
fourth cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Presently, a few drugs are 
available for HCC treatment and prevention, including both natural and synthetic 
compounds. In this study, a new chalcone, 
(E)-1-(2,4,6-triethoxyphenyl)-3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (ETTC), 
was synthesized and its effects and mechanisms of action over human hepatoma 
cells were investigated. Cytotoxic activity was revealed in HCC cells, while no 
effects were observed in normal hepatocytes. In HCC cells, ETTC caused subG1 
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, characterized by nuclear fragmentation. The 
activation of caspases 3/7 and 9, the increase in pro-apoptotic BAX, and the 
decrease in anti-apoptotic BCL-2 suggest the activation of the intrinsic pathway 
of apoptosis. ETTC mitochondrial targeting is confirmed by the reduction in 
mitochondrial membrane potential and Complex I activity together with levels of 
superoxide anion increasing. Our outcomes prove the potential 
mitochondria-mediated antitumor effect of newly synthesized chalcone ETTC in 
HCC."
2170,"Currently, sensitive and specific methods for the detection and prognosis of 
early stage PCa are lacking. To establish the diagnosis and further identify an 
appropriate treatment strategy, prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test 
followed by tissue biopsy have to be performed. The combination of tests is 
justified by the lack of a highly sensitive, specific, and safe single test. 
Tissue biopsy is specific but invasive and may have severe side effects, and 
therefore is inappropriate for screening of the disease. At the same time, the 
PSA blood test, which is conventionally used for PCa screening, has low 
specificity and may be elevated in the case of noncancerous prostate tumors and 
inflammatory conditions, including benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. 
Thus, diverse techniques of liquid biopsy have been investigated to supplement 
or replace the existing tests of prostate cancer early diagnosis and 
prognostics. Here, we provide a review on the advances in diagnosis and 
prognostics of non-metastatic prostate cancer by means of various biomarkers 
extracted via liquid biopsy, including circulating tumor cells, exosomal miRNAs, 
and circulating DNAs."
2171,"Patients with stage IV colorectal cancer (CRC) who have not undergone primary 
tumor resection (PTR) are at risk of sudden medical emergencies. Despite the 
ongoing controversy over the necessity and timing of PTR in patients with stage 
IV CRC, studies comparing the survival outcomes of elective and emergency 
surgery in this population are scarce. This is a retrospective study conducted 
at a single institute. The patients were divided into two groups: the elective 
surgery (ELS) group (n = 46) and the emergency surgery (EMS) group (n = 26). The 
primary outcome was 2-year overall survival (OS). During a median follow-up 
period of 27.0 months, the 2-year OS was significantly better in the ELS group 
(80% vs. 42.9%, p = 0.002). No significant differences were observed in the 
2-year relapse-free survival and 30-day postoperative complication rates. 
Planning and performing elective surgery could help increase the survival rate 
of patients with synchronous stage IV CRC, especially those that undergo 
simultaneous or staged metastasectomy."
2172,"Humans and other organisms are continuously exposed to thousands of chemicals 
through the atmosphere, drinking water, food, or direct contact. A large 
proportion of such chemicals are present in very low concentrations and may have 
synergistic effects, even at their no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL). 
Complex mixtures of contaminants are very difficult to assess by traditional 
toxicological methods. There is increasing attention on how different pollutants 
induce adverse physiological functions in the human body through effects on the 
circadian rhythm. However, it is very difficult to screen for compounds with 
circadian-rhythm-disrupting effects from a large number of chemicals or their 
complex mixtures. We established a stable firefly luciferase reporter gene 
knock-in U2-OS cell line by CRISPR/Cas9 to screen circadian-rhythm-disrupting 
pollutants. The luciferase gene was inserted downstream of the core clock gene 
BMAL1 and controlled by an endogenous promoter. Compared to detection systems 
using exogenous promoters, these cells enable the detection of compounds that 
interfere with the circadian rhythm system mediated by BMAL1 gene expression. 
The U2-OS knock-in cells showed BMAL1 and luciferase activity had parallel 
changes when treated with BMAL1 inhibitor and activator. Furthermore, the 
luciferase reporter gene has high sensitivity and is faster and more 
cost-effective than classic toxicology methods. The knock-in cell line can be 
used for high-throughput and efficient screening of circadian-rhythm-disrupting 
chemicals such as drugs and pollutants."
2173,"Therapy options for advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) include 
the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) 
with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE, however further optimization in the therapeutic 
landscape is required as response rates are still low. In this study, we 
investigated the synergistic and potentially enhanced efficacy of a combined 
treatment with everolimus and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in a mouse model. Baseline 
[68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET scans were obtained five days after athymic CD1 mice were 
inoculated with AR42J tumor cells, before separating the animals into four 
groups. Group 1 received a placebo, group 2 everolimus, group 3 a placebo and 
PRRT, and group 4 everolimus and PRRT. The treatment response was monitored by 
manually measuring the tumor volumes (manual tumor volume, MTV) and conducting 
sequential [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET scans at one, two, and four weeks after 
treatment induction. The biological tumor volume (BTV) was derived from PET 
scans using threshold-based volume of interest (VOI) measurements. Tracer uptake 
was measured semi-quantitatively as a tumor to background ratio (TBR). Mice were 
euthanized due to excessive tumor growth according to the ethics protocol; blood 
samples were drawn for the preparation of full blood counts and kidneys were 
obtained for histological analysis. For the histological assessment, a 
standardized score (renal damage score, RDS) was used. Full blood counts showed 
significantly increased numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the groups 
receiving PRRT. All other parameters did not differ relevantly. In the 
histological analysis, groups receiving PRRT had a significantly higher RDS, 
whereas everolimus only tended to cause an increase in the RDS. Mice in groups 1 
and 2 had to be euthanized due to excessive tumor growth two weeks after the 
start of the therapy, whereas follow-up in groups 3 and 4 comprised four weeks. 
PRRT significantly inhibited tumor growth; the administration of everolimus did 
not induce an additional effect. A good correlation existed between MTV and BTV. 
PRRT significantly reduced the TBR. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE PET is suitable for 
monitoring tumor growth in the applied model. The high efficacy of 
[177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE is not enhanced by the combination with everolimus."
2174,"The human genome is composed of unique DNA sequences that encode proteins and 
unique sequence noncoding RNAs that are essential for normal development and 
cellular differentiation. The human genome also contains over 50% of genome 
sequences that are repeat in nature (tandem and interspersed repeats) that are 
now known to contribute dynamically to genetic diversity in populations, to be 
transcriptionally active under certain physiological conditions, and to be 
aberrantly active in disease states including cancer, where consequences are 
pleiotropic with impact on cancer cell phenotypes and on the tumor immune 
microenvironment. Repeat element-derived RNAs play unique roles in exogenous and 
endogenous cell signaling under normal and disease conditions. A key component 
of repeat element-derived transcript-dependent signaling occurs via triggering 
of innate immune receptor signaling that then feeds forward to inflammatory 
responses through interferon and NFκB signaling. It has recently been shown that 
cancer cells display abnormal transcriptional activity of repeat elements and 
that this is linked to either aggressive disease and treatment failure or to 
improved prognosis/treatment response, depending on cell context and the 
amplitude of the so-called 'viral mimicry' response that is engaged. 'Viral 
mimicry' refers to a cellular state of active antiviral response triggered by 
endogenous nucleic acids often derived from aberrantly transcribed endogenous 
retrotransposons and other repeat elements. In this paper, the literature 
regarding transcriptional activation of repeat elements and engagement of 
inflammatory signaling in normal (focusing on hematopoiesis) and cancer is 
reviewed with an emphasis on the role of innate immune receptor signaling, in 
particular by dsRNA receptors of the RIG-1 like receptor family and 
interferons/NFκB. How repeat element-derived RNA reprograms cell identity 
through RNA-guided chromatin state modulation is also discussed."
2175,"Cancer is a prominent cause of death worldwide in the pediatric population. 
Since childhood cancer is not possible to prevent, it is essential to focus on a 
prompt and correct diagnosis followed by effective, evidence-based therapy with 
individualized supportive care. Given the enhancement of childhood cancer 
management over the past decades, survival rate has significantly improved, thus 
leading to the progression of several late effects, including metabolic 
derangements. These metabolic imbalances are associated with the underlying 
disease and the cancer treatments. As a result, the metabolic state may 
contribute to a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and premature mortality 
among childhood cancer survivors. This review aims to summarize the potential 
pathophysiological mechanisms linked to the risk of diabetes and metabolic 
syndrome and screening recommendations. Further investigations are needed to 
clarify the underlying mechanisms of such metabolic abnormalities and to improve 
long-term cardiometabolic survival among these patients."
2176,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies induce durable responses in 
approximately 15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who exhibit microsatellite 
instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR). However, more than 
80% of CRC patients do not respond to current immunotherapy. The main challenge 
with these patients is lack of MHC-I signaling to unmask their cancer cells so 
the immune cells can detect them. Here, we started by comparing IFNγ signature 
genes and MHC-I correlated gene lists to determine the potential candidates for 
MHC-I regulators. Then, the protein expression level of listed potential 
candidates in normal and cancer tissue was compared to select final candidates 
with enough disparity between the two types of tissues. ISG15 and DDX60 were 
further tested by wet-lab experiments. Overexpression of DDX60 upregulated the 
expression of MHC-I, while knockdown of DDX60 reduced the MHC-I expression in 
CRC cells. Moreover, DDX60 was downregulated in CRC tissues, and lower levels of 
DDX60 were associated with a poor prognosis. Our data showed that DDX60 could 
regulate MHC-I expression in CRC; thus, targeting DDX60 may improve the effects 
of immunotherapy in some patients."
2177,"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in children and adolescents 
worldwide; among the types of liver cancer, hepatoblastoma (HBL) is the most 
common in childhood. Although it affects only two to three individuals in a 
million, it is mostly asymptomatic at diagnosis, so by the time it is detected 
it has already advanced. There are specific recommendations regarding HBL 
treatment, and ongoing studies to stratify the risks of HBL, understand the 
pathology, and predict prognostics and survival rates. Although magnetic 
resonance imaging spectroscopy is frequently used in diagnostics of HBL, 
high-resolution magic-angle-spinning (HR-MAS) NMR spectroscopy of HBL tissues is 
scarce. Using this technique, we studied the alterations among tissue 
metabolites of ex vivo samples from (a) HBL and non-cancer liver tissues (NCL), 
(b) HBL and adjacent non-tumor samples, and (c) two regions of the same HBL 
samples, one more centralized and the other at the edge of the tumor. It was 
possible to identify metabolites in HBL, then metabolites from the HBL center 
and the border samples, and link them to altered metabolisms in tumor tissues, 
highlighting their potential as biochemical markers. Metabolites closely related 
to liver metabolisms such as some phospholipids, triacylglycerides, fatty acids, 
glucose, and amino acids showed differences between the tissues."
2178,"In modern oncology, therapies are based on combining monotherapies to overcome 
treatment resistance and increase therapy precision. The application of 
microsecond-pulsed electric fields (PEF) is approved to enhance local 
chemotherapeutic drug uptake within combination electrochemotherapy regimens. 
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in anticancer effects, and 
cold physical plasma produces vast amounts of ROS, which have recently been 
shown to benefit head and neck cancer patients. PEF and cold plasma technology 
have been linked to immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction, a regulated cell 
death accompanied by sterile inflammation that promotes antitumor immunity. To 
this end, we investigated the combined effect of both treatments regarding their 
intracellular ROS accumulation, toxicity, ICD-related marker expression, and 
optimal exposure sequence in a leukemia model cell line. The combination 
treatment substantially increased ROS and intracellular glutathione levels, 
leading to additive cytotoxic effects accompanied by a significantly increased 
expression of ICD markers, such as the eat-me signal calreticulin (CRT). 
Preconditioned treatment with cold plasma followed by PEF exposure was the most 
potent treatment sequence. The results indicate additive effects of cold plasma 
and PEF, motivating further studies in skin and breast tumor models for the 
future improvement of ECT in such patients."
2179,"Hormonally upregulated neu-associated kinase (HUNK) is a serine/threonine (S/T) 
protein kinase related to the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase 
(AMPK) family of kinases. HUNK was originally discovered using a screen to 
identify kinases expressed in the mouse mammary gland. Therefore, the majority 
of studies to date have been carried out in models specific to this tissue, and 
the kinase was named to reflect its mammary gland-specific physiology and 
pathology. Prior studies show a clear pathogenic role for HUNK in breast cancer. 
HUNK is upregulated in response to oncogenic HER2/neu and Akt, and there is 
strong evidence that HUNK is critical for the survival of breast cancer cells. 
Further evidence shows that inhibiting HUNK using a variety of breast cancer 
models, including those that are resistant, inhibits tumorigenesis and 
metastasis. However, HUNK alterations are infrequent. Here, the incidence and 
consequence of HUNK alterations in breast cancer is reviewed using data mined

studies."
2180,"The COVID-19 outbreak had a strong impact on people's lives all over the world. 
Patients with hematologic diseases have been heavily affected by the pandemic, 
because their immune system may be compromised due to anti-cancer or 
immunosuppressive therapies and because diagnosis and treatment of their 
baseline conditions were delayed during lockdowns. Hematologic malignancies 
emerged very soon as risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection, increasing the 
mortality rate. SARS-CoV2 can also induce or exacerbate immune-mediated 
cytopenias, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemias, complement-mediated anemias, 
and immune thrombocytopenia. Active immunization with vaccines has been shown to 
be the best prophylaxis of severe COVID-19 in hematologic patients. However, the 
immune response to vaccines may be significantly impaired, especially in those 
receiving anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or immunosuppressive agents. Recently, 
antiviral drugs and monoclonal antibodies have become available for pre-exposure 
and post-exposure prevention of severe COVID-19. As adverse events after 
vaccines are extremely rare, the cost-benefit ratio is largely in favor of 
vaccination, even in patients who might be non-responders; in the hematological 
setting, all patients should be considered at high risk of developing 
complications due to SARS-CoV2 infection and should be offered all the therapies 
aimed to prevent them."
2181,"CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7, which are located in a multigene locus (CYP3A), play 
crucial roles in drug metabolism. To understand the highly variable hepatic 
expression of CYP3As, regulatory network analyses have focused on transcription 
factors (TFs). Since long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) likely contribute to such 
networks, we assessed the regulatory effects of both TFs and lncRNAs on CYP3A 
expression in the human liver and small intestine, main organs of CYP3A 
expression. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of GTEx 
v8 RNA expression data and multiple stepwise regression analysis, we constructed 
TF-lncRNA-CYP3A co-expression networks. Multiple lncRNAs and TFs displayed 
robust associations with CYP3A expression that differed between liver and small 
intestines (LINC02499, HNF4A-AS1, AC027682.6, LOC102724153, and RP11-503C24.6), 
indicating that lncRNAs contribute to variance in CYP3A expression in both 
organs. Of these, HNF4A-AS1 had been experimentally demonstrated to affect CYP3A 
expression. Incorporating ncRNAs into CYP3A expression regulatory network 
revealed additional candidate TFs associated with CYP3A expression. These 
results serve as a guide for experimental studies on lncRNA-TF regulation of 
CYP3A expression in the liver and small intestines."
2182,"Ocular metastases are the most frequent ocular malignant tumors; their 
prevalence is estimated around 5-10% and is even higher in patients with breast 
or lung cancer. They represent various clinical situations, but they share the 
same hierarchical multidisciplinary therapeutic challenge with respect to the 
way systemic and local therapies should be selected in combination or 
sequentially in the personalized medical history of a patient. The challenges 
include tumor control, eye preservation, and the minimization of iatrogenic 
damage to sensitive tissues surrounding the tumor in order to preserve vision. 
These aims should further contribute to maintaining quality of life in patients 
with metastases. Many patients with choroidal metastases have systemic molecular 
treatment for their primary tumor. However, secondary resistance to systemic 
treatment is common and may ultimately be associated with cancer relapse, even 
after an initial response. Therefore, it makes sense to propose local treatment 
concomitantly or after systemic therapy to provide a more sustainable response. 
The aim of this review is to present current therapeutic strategies in ocular 
metastases and discuss how to tailor the treatment to a specific patient."
2183,"Interleukin-37 (IL-37) is a relatively new IL-1 family cytokine that, due to its 
immunoregulatory properties, has lately gained increasing attention in basic and 
translational biomedical research. Emerging evidence supports the implication of 
this protein in any human disorder in which immune homeostasis is compromised, 
including cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the prognostic and/or 
diagnostic potential of IL-37 and its receptor SIGIRR (single immunoglobulin 
IL-1-related receptor) in human tumors. We utilized a series of bioinformatics 
tools and -omics datasets to unravel possible associations of IL-37 and SIGIRR 
expression levels and genetic aberrations with tumor development, 
histopathological parameters, distribution of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, 
and survival rates of patients. Our data revealed that amongst the 17 human 
malignancies investigated, IL-37 exhibits higher expression levels in tumors of 
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Moreover, the expression profiles of IL-37 and 
SIGIRR are associated with LUAD development and tumor stage, whereas their high 
mRNA levels are favorable prognostic factors for the overall survival of 
patients. What is more, IL-37 correlates positively with a LUAD-associated 
transcriptomic signature, and its nucleotide changes and expression levels are 
linked with distinct infiltration patterns of certain cell subsets known to 
control LUAD anti-tumor immune responses. Our data indicate the potential value 
of IL-37 and its receptor SIGIRR to serve as biomarkers and/or immune-checkpoint 
therapeutic targets for LUAD patients. Further, the data highlight the urgent 
need for further exploration of this cytokine and the underlying pathogenetic 
mechanisms to fully elucidate its implication in LUAD development and 
progression."
2184,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T adoptive cell therapy is one of the most 
promising advanced therapies for the treatment of cancer, with unprecedented 
outcomes in haematological malignancies. However, it still lacks efficacy in 
solid tumours, possibly because engineered T cells become inactive within the 
immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME). In the TME, cells of the 
myeloid lineage (M) are among the immunosuppressive cell types with the highest 
tumour infiltration rate. These cells interact with other immune cells, 
mediating immunosuppression and promoting angiogenesis. Recently, the 
development of CAR-M cell therapies has been put forward as a new candidate 
immunotherapy with good efficacy potential. This alternative CAR strategy may 
increase the efficacy, survival, persistence, and safety of CAR treatments in 
solid tumours. This remains a critical frontier in cancer research and opens up 
a new possibility for next-generation personalised medicine to overcome TME 
resistance. However, the exact mechanisms of action of CAR-M and their effect on 
the TME remain poorly understood. Here, we summarise the basic, translational, 
and clinical results of CAR-innate immune cells and CAR-M cell immunotherapies, 
from their engineering and mechanistic studies to preclinical and clinical 
development."
2185,"Gliomas are the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors. Gliomas carry a 
poor prognosis because of the tumor's resistance to radiation and chemotherapy 
leading to nearly universal recurrence. Recent advances in large-scale genomic 
research have allowed for the development of more targeted therapies to treat 
glioma. While precision medicine can target specific molecular features in 
glioma, targeted therapies are often not feasible due to the lack of actionable 
markers and the high cost of molecular testing. This review summarizes the 
clinically relevant molecular features in glioma and the current cost of care 
for glioma patients, focusing on the molecular markers and meaningful clinical 
features that are linked to clinical outcomes and have a realistic possibility 
of being measured, which is a promising direction for precision medicine using 
artificial intelligence approaches."
2186,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy in men of middle and older 
age. The standard treatment strategy for PCa ranges from active surveillance in 
low-grade, localized PCa to radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation 
therapy, hormonal treatment and chemotherapy. Recently, the use of 
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) for 
metastatic castration-resistant PCa has been approved. PSMA is predominantly, 
but not exclusively, expressed on PCa cells. Because of its high expression in 
PCa, PSMA is a promising target for diagnostics and therapy. To understand the 
currently used RLT, knowledge about pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics 
(PD) of the PSMA ligand and the PSMA protein itself is crucial. PK and PD 
properties of the ligand and its target determine the duration and extent of the 
effect. Knowledge on the concentration-time profile, the target affinity and 
target abundance may help to predict the effect of RLT. Increased specific 
binding of radioligands to PSMA on PCa cells may be associated with better 
treatment response, where nonspecific binding may increase the risk of toxicity 
in healthy organs. Optimization of the radioligand, as well as synergistic 
effects of concomitant agents and an improved dosing strategy, may lead to more 
individualized treatment and better overall survival."
2187,"The malignant melanoma of the skin is a very aggressive tumor. The determination 
of prognostic biomarkers is important for the early detection of recurrence, and 
for the enrollment of the patients into different treatment regimens. An 
evaluation of a cohort of 375 Polish MM cases revealed that a low serum iron 
concentration (i.e., below 893.05 µg/L) was associated with increased mortality. 
The study group was followed up from the date of melanoma diagnosis until death 
or 2020. Patients were assigned to one of four categories in accordance with 
increasing iron level (I-IV quarters). Patients with a low iron level of below 
893.05 µg/L (I quarter) had a significantly lower survival rate when compared to 
the subgroup with the highest iron level, above 1348.63 µg/L (IV quarter; HR = 
4.12; p = 0.028 and HR = 4.66; p = 0.019 for uni- and multivariable models, 
respectively). Multivariable analysis took into account the following factors: 
iron levels, Clark, sex, and age. Future studies based upon the examination of a 
larger number of cases should be conducted to confirm our findings."
2188,"BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most commonly 
detected neoplasms worldwide. Not all mechanisms associated with cell cycle 
disturbances are known in OSCC. Examples of genes involved in the control of the 
cell cycle are CDKN2A, MDM2, E2F2 and LTF. The aim of this study was to examine 
the possible association between CDKN2A, MDM2, E2F2 and LTF mRNA expression and 
influence on clinical variables.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 88 Polish patients. The gene expression 
levels were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR.
RESULTS: We found no statistically significant differences in the expression 
level of CDKN2A, MDM2, E2F2 and LTF genes in tumour samples compared to margin 
samples. No association was found between the gene expression levels and 
clinical parameters, except E2F2. The patients with G2 tumours had a 
significantly higher gene expression level of E2F2 than patients with low-grade 
G1 tumours.
CONCLUSIONS: We have not demonstrated that a change in expression profiles of 
genes has a significant impact on the pathogenesis of OSCC. It may also be 
useful to conduct further studies on the use of E2F2 expression profile changes 
as a factor to describe the invasiveness and dynamics of OSCC development."
2189,"Comprehensive genomic profiling examinations (CGPs) have recently been 
developed, and a variety of tumor-agnostic mutations have been detected, leading 
to the development of new molecular-targetable therapies across solid tumors. In 
addition, the elucidation of hereditary tumors, such as breast and ovarian 
cancer, has pioneered a new age marked by the development of new treatments and 
lifetime management strategies required for patients with potential or presented 
hereditary cancers. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, few tumor-agnostic 
or hereditary mutations have been the focus of investigation, with associated 
molecular-targeted therapies remaining poorly developed. We focused on 
representative tumor-agnostic mutations such as the TP53, KIT, KRAS, BRCA1, ATM, 
JAK2, NTRK3, FGFR3 and EGFR genes, referring to a CGP study conducted in Japan, 
and we considered the possibility of developing molecular-targeted therapies for 
AML with tumor-agnostic mutations. We summarized the frequency, the prognosis, 
the structure and the function of these mutations as well as the current 
treatment strategies in solid tumors, revealed the genetical relationships 
between solid tumors and AML and developed tumor-agnostic molecular-targeted 
therapies and lifetime management strategies in AML."
2190,"BACKGROUND: Oesophageal cancer patients have poor survival, and most are unfit 
for curative or systemic palliative treatment. This article aims to review the 
best supportive care for oesophageal cancer, focusing on the management of its 
most frequent or distinctive symptoms and complications.
METHODS: Evidence-based review on palliative supportive care of oesophageal 
cancer, based on Pubmed search for relevant clinical practice guidelines, 
reviews and original articles, with additional records collected from related 
articles suggestions, references and societies recommendations.
RESULTS: We identified 1075 records, from which we screened 138 records that 
were related to oesophageal cancer supportive care, complemented with 48 
additional records, finally including 60 records. This review summarizes the 
management of oesophageal cancer-related main problems, including dysphagia, 
malnutrition, pain, nausea and vomiting, fistula and bleeding. In recent years, 
several treatments have been developed, while optimal management is not yet 
standardized.
CONCLUSION: This review contributes toward improving supportive care and 
decision making for oesophageal cancer patients, presenting updated summary 
recommendations for each of their main symptoms. A robust body of evidence is 
still lacking, and the best supportive care decisions should be individualized 
and shared."
2191,"Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease that can be triggered by genetic 
alterations in mammary epithelial cells, leading to diverse disease outcomes in 
individual patients. The metabolic heterogeneity of BC enhances its ability to 
adapt to changes in the tumor microenvironment and metabolic stress, but 
unfavorably affects the patient's therapy response, prognosis and clinical 
effect. Extrinsic factors from the tumor microenvironment and the intrinsic 
parameters of cancer cells influence their mitochondrial functions, which 
consequently alter their lipid metabolism and their ability to proliferate, 
migrate and survive in a harsh environment. The balanced interplay between 
mitochondria and fatty acid synthesis or fatty acid oxidation has been 
attributed to a combination of environmental factors and to the genetic makeup, 
oncogenic signaling and activities of different transcription factors. Hence, 
understanding the mechanisms underlying lipid metabolic heterogeneity and 
alterations in BC is gaining interest as a major target for drug resistance. 
Here we review the major recent reports on lipid metabolism heterogeneity and 
bring to light knowledge on the functional contribution of diverse lipid 
metabolic pathways to breast tumorigenesis and therapy resistance."

healthcare access (HCA) [...]."
2193,"Radiation necrosis represents a potentially devastating complication after 
radiation therapy in brain tumors. The establishment of the diagnosis and 
especially the differentiation from progression and pseudoprogression with its 
therapeutic implications requires interdisciplinary consent and monitoring. 
Herein, we want to provide an overview of the diagnostic modalities, therapeutic 
possibilities and an outlook on future developments to tackle this challenging 
topic. The aim of this report is to provide an overview of the current 
morphological, functional, metabolic and evolving imaging tools described in the 
literature in order to (I) identify the best criteria to distinguish 
radionecrosis from tumor recurrence after the radio-oncological treatment of 
malignant gliomas and cerebral metastases, (II) analyze the therapeutic 
possibilities and (III) give an outlook on future developments to tackle this 
challenging topic. Additionally, we provide the experience of a tertiary tumor 
center with this important issue in neuro-oncology and provide an institutional 
pathway dealing with this problem."
2194,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy. It 
originates from the bile ducts and is the second most common primary cancer of 
the liver. Surgery is considered the only curative treatment of ICC, offering 
the best chance for long-term survival. The purpose of this article is to review 
the available literature on ICC, with a focus on the various aspects of the 
surgical care in this potentially lethal malignancy."
2195,"BACKGROUND: A 23-gene classifier has been developed based on gene expression 
profiles of Taiwanese luminal-like breast cancer. We aim to stratify risk of 
relapse and identify patients who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy based 
on genetic model among distinct clinical risk groups.
METHODS: There were 248 luminal (hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal 
growth factor receptor II-negative) breast cancer patients with 23-gene 
classifier results. Using the modified Adjuvant! Online definition, clinical 
high/low-risk groups were tabulated with the genetic model. The primary endpoint 
was a recurrence-free interval (RFI) at 5 years.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the high/low-risk groups 
defined by the 23-gene classifier for the 5-year prognosis of recurrence (16 
recurrences in high-risk and 3 recurrences in low-risk; log-rank test: p &lt; 
0.0001). Among the clinically high-risk group, the 5-year RFI of high risk 
defined by the 23-gene classifier was significantly higher than that of the 
low-risk group (15 recurrences in high-risk and 2 recurrences in low-risk; 
log-rank test: p &lt; 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This study showed that 23-gene classifier can be used to stratify 
clinically high-risk patients into distinct survival patterns based on genomic 
risks and displays the potentiality to guide adjuvant chemotherapy. The 23-gene 
classifier can provide a better estimation of breast cancer prognosis which can 
help physicians make a better treatment decision."
2196,"Endometrial cancers (ECs) are mostly adenocarcinomas arising from the inner part 
of the uterus. The identification of serum biomarkers, either soluble or carried 
in the exosome, may be useful in making an early diagnosis. We used label-free 
quantification mass spectrometry (LFQ-MS)-based proteomics to investigate the 
proteome of exosomes in the albumin-depleted serum from 12 patients with EC, as 
compared to 12 healthy controls. After quantification and statistical analysis, 
we found significant changes in the abundance (p &lt; 0.05) of 33 proteins in EC 
vs. control samples, with a fold change of ≥1.5 or ≤0.6. Validation using 
Western blotting analysis in 36 patients with EC as compared to 36 healthy 
individuals confirmed the upregulation of APOA1, HBB, CA1, HBD, LPA, SAA4, 
PF4V1, and APOE. A multivariate logistic regression model based on the abundance 
of these proteins was able to separate the controls from the EC patients with 
excellent sensitivity levels, particularly for stage 1 ECs. The results show 
that using LFQ-MS to explore the specific proteome of serum exosomes allows for 
the identification of biomarkers in EC. These observations suggest that PF4V1, 
CA1, HBD, and APOE represent biomarkers that are able to reach the clinical 
stage, after a validation phase."
2197,"The purpose of the present study was to examine the potential of a machine 
learning model with integrated clinical and CT-based radiomics features in 
predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant systemic therapy 
(NST) in breast cancer. Contrast-enhanced CT was performed in 329 patients with 
breast tumors (n = 331) before NST. Pyradiomics was used for feature extraction, 
and 107 features of seven classes were extracted. Feature selection was 
performed on the basis of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and six 
ICC thresholds (0.7-0.95) were examined to identify the feature set resulting in 
optimal model performance. Clinical factors, such as age, clinical stage, cancer 
cell type, and cell surface receptors, were used for prediction. We tried six 
machine learning algorithms, and clinical, radiomics, and clinical-radiomics 
models were trained for each algorithm. Radiomics and clinical-radiomics models 
with gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features only were also built for 
comparison. The linear support vector machine (SVM) regression model trained 
with radiomics features of ICC ≥0.85 in combination with clinical factors 
performed the best (AUC = 0.87). The performance of the clinical and radiomics 
linear SVM models showed statistically significant difference after correction 
for multiple comparisons (AUC = 0.69 vs. 0.78; p &lt; 0.001). The AUC of the 
radiomics model trained with GLCM features was significantly lower than that of 
the radiomics model trained with all seven classes of radiomics features (AUC = 
0.85 vs. 0.87; p = 0.011). Integration of clinical and CT-based radiomics 
features was helpful in the pretreatment prediction of pCR to NST in breast 
cancer."
2198,"Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer, the high-grade serous 
ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) being its most common and most aggressive form. Despite 
the latest therapeutical advancements following the introduction of vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) targeting angiogenesis inhibitors and 
poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) inhibitors to supplement the standard 
platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy, the expected overall survival of HGSC 
patients has not improved significantly from the five-year rate of 42%. This 
calls for the development and testing of more efficient treatment options. Many 
oncogenic kinase-signaling pathways are dysregulated in HGSC. Since 
small-molecule kinase inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of many solid 
cancers due to the generality of the increased activation of protein kinases in 
carcinomas, it is reasonable to evaluate their potential against HGSC. Here, we 
present the latest concluded and on-going clinical trials on kinase inhibitors 
in HGSC, as well as the recent work concerning ovarian cancer patient organoids 
and xenograft models. We discuss the potential of kinase inhibitors as 
personalized treatments, which would require comprehensive assessment of the 
biological mechanisms underlying tumor spread and chemoresistance in individual 
patients, and their connection to tumor genome and transcriptome to establish 
identifiable subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit from a given 
therapy."
2199,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks third among all cancers in terms of prevalence. 
There is growing evidence that gut microbiota has a role in the development of 
colorectal cancer. Fusobacterium nucleatum is overrepresented in the 
gastrointestinal tract and tumor microenvironment of patients with CRC. This 
suggests the role of F. nucleatum as a potential risk factor in the development 
of CRC. Hence, we aimed to explore whole genomes of F. nucleatum strains related 
to CRC to predict potential therapeutic markers through a pan-genome integrated 
subtractive genomics approach. In the current study, we identified 538 proteins 
as essential for F. nucleatum survival, 209 non-homologous to a human host, and 
12 as drug targets. Eventually, riboflavin synthase (RiS) was selected as a 
therapeutic target for further processing. Three different inhibitor libraries 
of lead-like natural products, i.e., cyanobactins (n = 237), streptomycins (n = 
607), and marine bacterial secondary metabolites (n = 1226) were screened 
against it. After the structure-based study, three compounds, i.e., CMNPD3609 
(-7.63) &gt; Malyngamide V (-7.03) &gt; ZINC06804365 (-7.01) were prioritized as 
potential inhibitors of F. nucleatum. Additionally, the stability and 
flexibility of these compounds bound to RiS were determined via a molecular 
dynamics simulation of 50 ns. Results revealed the stability of these compounds 
within the binding pocket, after 5 ns. ADMET profiling showed compounds as 
drug-like, non-permeable to the blood brain barrier, non-toxic, and HIA 
permeable. Pan-genomics mediated drug target identification and the virtual 
screening of inhibitors is the preliminary step towards inhibition of this 
pathogenic oncobacterium and we suggest mouse model experiments to validate our 
findings."
2200,"Autologous stem cell transplantation is routinely used in the management of 
several hematological diseases, solid tumors, and immune disorders. Peripheral 
blood stem cell (PBSC) collection performed by apheresis is the preferred source 
of stem cells. In this study, the potential impact of mobilization regimens on 
the performance of the Spectra Optia® continuous mononuclear cell collection 
system was evaluated. We performed a retrospective data analysis for patients 
undergoing autologous PBSC collection at the Medical University Vienna, Vienna 
General Hospital between September 2016 and June 2018. Collections were divided 
into two main groups according to the mobilization regimen received: without 
(210 collections) or with (99 collections) plerixafor. Assessed variables 
included product characteristics and collection efficiency (CE). Overall, 
product characteristics were similar between the groups. Median CD34+ CE2 was 
50.1% versus 53.0%, and CE1 was 66.9% versus 69.9% following mobilization 
without and with plerixafor, respectively; the difference was not statistically 
significant. Simple linear regression showed a very weak positive correlation 
between the mobilization method and CE1 or CE2 (mobilization with plerixafor 
increased CE2 by 4.106%). In conclusion, the Spectra Optia® apheresis system led 
to high CE and a good quality of PBSC products when mobilization regimens with 
or without plerixafor were used."
2201,"The limited treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer with brain 
metastasis (TNBC-BM) have left the door of further drug development for these 
patients wide open. Although immunotherapy via monoclonal antibodies has shown 
some promising results in several cancers including TNBC, it cannot be 
considered the most effective treatment for brain metastasis. This is due to the 
protective role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which limits the entrance of 
most drugs, especially the bulky ones such as antibodies, to the brain. For a 
drug to traverse the BBB via passive diffusion, various physicochemical 
properties should be considered. Since natural medicine has been a key 
inspiration for the development of the majority of current medicines, in this 
paper, we review several naturally-derived molecules which have the potential 
for immunotherapy via blocking the interaction of programmed cell death 
protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1. The mechanism of action, physicochemical 
properties and pharmacokinetics of these molecules and their theoretical 
potential to be used for the treatment of TNBC-BM are discussed."
2202,"Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among women in 
low- and middle-income countries such as South Africa. The current impact of 
national cervical cancer control and sexual and reproductive health 
interventions in South Africa reduce its burden. The aim of this study was to 
assess the trends in cervical cancer mortality and its relation to breast and 
gynaecological cancers in South Africa from 1999 to 2018. We conducted joinpoint 
regression analyses of the trends in crude and age-standardised mortality rates 
(ASMR) for cervical cancer mortality in South Africa from 1999 to 2018. An 
age-period-cohort regression analysis was also conducted to determine the impact 
of age, period, and cohort on cervical cancer mortality trends. Analyses were 
stratified by ethnicity. Cervical cancer (n = 59,190, 43.92%, 95% CI: 
43.65-44.18%) was responsible for about 43.9% of breast and gynecological cancer 
deaths. The mortality rate of cervical cancer (from 11.7 to 14.08 per 100,000) 
increased at about 0.9% per annum (Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC): 0.9% 
(AAPC: 0.9%, p-value &lt; 0.001)), and young women aged 25 to 49 years (AAPC: 
1.2-3.5%, p-value &lt; 0.001) had increased rates. The risk of cervical cancer 
mortality increased among successive birth cohorts. In 2018, cervical cancer 
mortality rate among Blacks (16.74 per 100,000 women) was about twice the rates 
among Coloureds (8.53 deaths per 100,000 women) and approximately four-fold 
among Indians/Asians (4.16 deaths per 100,000 women), and Whites (3.06 deaths 
per 100,000 women). Cervical cancer control efforts should be enhanced in South 
Africa and targeted at ethnic difference, age, period, and cohort effects."
2203,"MiR-22 was first identified as a proto-oncogenic microRNA (miRNA) due to its 
ability to post-transcriptionally suppress the expression of the potent PTEN 
(Phosphatase And Tensin Homolog) tumor suppressor gene. miR-22 tumorigenic role 
in cancer was subsequently supported by its ability to positively trigger 
lipogenesis, anabolic metabolism, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
towards the metastatic spread. However, during the following years, the picture 
was complicated by the identification of targets that support a 
tumor-suppressive role in certain tissues or cell types. Indeed, many papers 
have been published where in vitro cellular assays and in vivo immunodeficient 
or immunosuppressed xenograft models are used. However, here we show that all 
the studies performed in vivo, in immunocompetent transgenic and knock-out 
animal models, unanimously support a proto-oncogenic role for miR-22. Since 
miR-22 is actively secreted from and readily exchanged between normal and 
tumoral cells, a functional immune dimension at play could well represent the 
divider that allows reconciling these contradictory findings. In addition to a 
critical review of this vast literature, here we provide further proof of the 
oncogenic role of miR-22 through the analysis of its genomic locus vis a vis the 
genetic landscape of human cancer."
2204,"In this work, a time-dependent and time-independent study on bleomycin-based 
high-frequency nsECT (3.5 kV/cm × 200 pulses) for the elimination of LLC1 
tumours in C57BL/6J mice is performed. We show the efficiency of nsECT (200 ns 
and 700 ns delivered at 1 kHz and 1 MHz) for the elimination of tumours in mice 
and increase of their survival. The dynamics of the immunomodulatory effects 
were observed after electrochemotherapy by investigating immune cell populations 
and antitumour antibodies at different timepoints after the treatment. ECT 
treatment resulted in an increased percentage of CD4+ T, splenic memory B and 
tumour-associated dendritic cell subsets. Moreover, increased levels of 
antitumour IgG antibodies after ECT treatment were detected. Based on the 
time-dependent study results, nsECT treatment upregulated PD 1 expression on 
splenic CD4+ Tr1 cells, increased the expansion of splenic CD8+ T, CD4+CD8+ T, 
plasma cells and the proportion of tumour-associated pro inflammatory 
macrophages. The Lin- population of immune cells that was increased in the 
spleens and tumour after nsECT was identified. It was shown that nsECT prolonged 
survival of the treated mice and induced significant changes in the immune 
system, which shows a promising alliance of nanosecond electrochemotherapy and 
immunotherapy."
2205,"BACKGROUND: Real-time split-dose PET can identify the targeted colorectal liver 
metastasis (CLM) and eliminate the need for repeated contrast administration 
before and during thermal ablation (TA). This study aimed to assess the added 
value of pre-ablation real-time split-dose PET when combined with non-contract 
CT in the detection of CLM for ablation and the evaluation of the ablation zone 
and margins.
METHODS: A total of 190 CLMs/125 participants from two IRB-approved prospective 
clinical trials using PET/CT-guided TA were analyzed. Based on detection on 
pre-TA imaging, CLMs were categorized as detectable, non-detectable, and of poor 
conspicuity on CT alone, and detectable, non-detectable, and low FDG-avidity on 
PET/CT after the initial dose. Ablation margins around the targeted CLM were 
evaluated using a 3D volumetric approach.
RESULTS: We found that 129/190 (67.9%) CLMs were detectable on CT alone, and 
61/190 CLMs (32.1%) were undetectable or of poor conspicuity, not allowing 
accurate depiction and targeting by CT alone. Thus, the theoretical 5- and 10-mm 
margins could not be defined in these tumors (32.1%) using CT alone. When TA 
intraprocedural PET/CT images are obtained and inspected (fused PET/CT), only 4 
CLM (2.1%) remained undetectable or had a low FDG avidity.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of PET to non-contrast CT improved CLM detection for 
ablation targeting, margin assessments, and continuous depiction of the FDG avid 
CLMs during the ablation without the need for multiple intravenous contrast 
injections pre- and intra-procedurally."
2206,"(1) Background: radiotherapy is a cornerstone of cancer treatment. When 
delivering a tumoricidal dose, the risk of severe late toxicities is usually 
kept below 5% using dose-volume constraints. However, individual radiation 
sensitivity (iRS) is responsible (with other technical factors) for unexpected 
toxicities after exposure to a dose that induces no toxicity in the general 
population. Diagnosing iRS before radiotherapy could avoid unnecessary 
toxicities in patients with a grossly normal phenotype. Thus, we reviewed iRS 
diagnostic data and their impact on decision-making processes and the RT 
workflow; (2) Methods: following a description of radiation toxicities, we 
conducted a critical review of the current state of the knowledge on individual 
determinants of cellular/tissue radiation; (3) Results: tremendous advances in 
technology now allow minimally-invasive genomic, epigenetic and functional 
testing and a better understanding of iRS. Ongoing large translational studies 
implement various tests and enriched NTCP models designed to improve the 
prediction of toxicities. iRS testing could better support informed radiotherapy 
decisions for individuals with a normal phenotype who experience unusual 
toxicities. Ethics of medical decisions with an accurate prediction of 
personalized radiotherapy's risk/benefits and its health economics impact are at 
stake; (4) Conclusions: iRS testing represents a critical unmet need to design 
personalized radiotherapy protocols relying on extended NTCP models integrating 
iRS."
2207,"BACKGROUND: Spinal meningiomas are the most common primary intradural spinal 
tumors. Although they are a separate entity, a large portion of the knowledge on 
spinal meningiomas is based on findings in intracranial meningiomas. Therefore, 
a comprehensive review of all the literature on spinal meningiomas was 
performed.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for all studies on spinal 
meningiomas dating from 2000 and onward. Findings of matching studies were 
pooled to strengthen the current body of evidence.
RESULTS: A total of 104 studies were included. The majority of patients were 
female (72.83%), elderly (peak decade: seventh), and had a world health 
organization (WHO) grade 1 tumor (95.7%). Interestingly, the minority of 
pediatric patients had a male overrepresentation (62.0% vs. 27.17%) and 
higher-grade tumors (33.3% vs. 4.3%). Sensory and motor dysfunction and pain 
were the most common presenting symptoms. Despite a handful of studies reporting 
promising findings associated with the use of non-surgical treatment options, 
the literature still suffers from contradictory results and limitations of study 
designs.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly females with WHO grade 1 tumors constituted the 
stereotypical type of patient. Compared to surgical alternatives, the evidence 
for the use of non-surgical treatments is still relatively weak."
2208,"INTRODUCTION: Factors other than PD-L1 (Programmed Death Ligand 1) are being 
sought as predictors for cancer immuno- or chemoimmunotherapy in ongoing studies 
and long-term observations. Despite high PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, some 
patients do not benefit from immunotherapy, while others, without the expression 
of this molecule, respond to immunotherapy. Attention has been paid to the 
composition of the gut microbiome as a potential predictive factor for 
immunotherapy effectiveness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study enrolled 47 Caucasian patients with stage IIIB 
or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). They were eligible for treatment with 
first- or second-line immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. We collected stool 
samples before the administration of immunotherapy. We performed next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) on DNA isolated from the stool sample and analyzed bacterial V3 
and V4 of the 16S rRNA gene.
RESULTS: We found that bacteria from the families Barnesiellaceae, 
Ruminococcaceae, Tannerellaceae, and Clostridiaceae could modulate immunotherapy 
effectiveness. A high abundance of Bacteroidaaceae, Barnesiellaceae, and 
Tannerellaceae could extend progression-free survival (PFS). Moreover, the risk 
of death was significantly higher in patients with a high content of 
Ruminococcaceae family (HR = 6.3, 95% CI: 2.6 to 15.3, p &lt; 0.0001) and in 
patients with a low abundance of Clostridia UCG-014 (HR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5 to 
9.8, p = 0.005) regardless of the immunotherapy line.
CONCLUSIONS: The Clostridia class in gut microbiota could affect the 
effectiveness of immunotherapy, as well as the length of survival of NSCLC 
patients who received this method of treatment."
2209,"Central nervous system (CNS) metastatic spread in neuroblastoma (NB) is rare and 
occurs more often at relapse/progression. We report on CNS involvement in high 
risk (HR) NB over 25 years. For this retrospective study, we reviewed the CNS 
imaging of all the patients treated at Bambino Gesù Children Hospital from 1 
July 1996 to 30 June 2022. A total of 128 patients with HR NB were diagnosed 
over 26 years. Out of 128 patients, CNS metastatic spread occurred in 6 
patients: 3 patients presented a metastatic spread at diagnosis, while in 3 
patients, CNS was involved at relapse. Overall, the rate of occurrence of CNS 
spread is 4.7% with the same distribution at diagnosis and at relapse, namely 
2.3%. Interestingly, CNS spread at diagnosis was observed only before 2012, 
whereas CNS was observed at relapse only after 2012, in the immunotherapy era. 
CNS metastases presented similar imaging features at diagnosis and at relapse, 
with a peculiar hemorrhagic aspect and mainly hemispheric localization in 
patients with bone skull involvement at the time of diagnosis. The outcome is 
dismal, and 3 out of 6 patients died for progressive disease."
2210,"BACKGROUND: Low-dose-rate brachytherapy is an effective organ-sparing treatment 
for patients with early-stage penile cancer. However, only limited data are 
available on the role of high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) in this clinical 
setting.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2020, 31 patients with early penile cancer were 
treated at our center with interstitial HDR BT at a dose of 18 × 3 Gy twice 
daily. A breast brachytherapy template was used for the fixation of stainless 
hollow needles.
RESULTS: The median follow-up was 117.5 months (range, 5-210). Eight patients 
(25.8%) developed a recurrence; of these, seven were salvaged by partial 
amputation. Six patients died of internal comorbidities or a second cancer. The 
probability of local control at 5 and 10 years was 80.7% (95% CI: 63.7-97.7%) 
and 68.3% (95% CI: 44.0-92.6%), respectively. Cause-specific survival was 100%. 
Only one case of radiation-induced necrosis was observed. The probability of 
penile sparing at 5 and 10 years was 80.6% (95% CI: 63.45-97.7%) and 62.1% (95% 
CI: 34.8-89.4%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show that HDR-BT for penile cancer can achieve 
results comparable to LDR-BT with organ sparing. Despite the relatively large 
patient cohort-the second largest reported to date in this clinical 
setting-prospective data from larger samples are needed to confirm the role of 
HDR-BT in penile cancer."
2211,"Uveal melanoma originating in the eye and metastasizing to the liver is 
associated with poor prognosis and has only one approved therapeutic option. We 
hypothesized that liver-borne growth factors may contribute to UM growth. 
Therefore, we investigated the role of IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling in UM. Here, we 
found that IRS-1, the insulin receptor substrate, is overexpressed in both UM 
cells and tumors. Since we previously observed that IGF-1R antibody therapy was 
not clinically effective in UM, we investigated the potential of NT157, a small 
molecule inhibitor of IRS-1/2, in blocking this pathway in UM. NT157 treatment 
of multiple UM cell lines resulted in reduced cell growth and migration and 
increased apoptosis. This treatment also significantly inhibited UM tumor growth 
in vivo, in the chicken egg chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and subcutaneous 
mouse models, validating the in vitro effect. Mechanistically, through reverse 
phase protein array (RPPA), we identified significant proteomic changes in the 
PI3K/AKT pathway, a downstream mediator of IGF-1 signaling, with NT157 
treatment. Together, these results suggest that NT157 inhibits cell growth, 
survival, and migration in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo via inhibiting IGF-1 
signaling in UM."
2212,"In the United States, over 100,000 women are diagnosed with a gynecologic 
malignancy every year, with ovarian cancer being the most lethal. One of the 
hallmark characteristics of ovarian cancer is the development of resistance to 
chemotherapeutics. While the exact mechanisms of chemoresistance are poorly 
understood, it is known that changes at the cellular and molecular level make 
chemoresistance challenging to treat. Improved therapeutic options are needed to 
target these changes at the molecular level. Using a precision medicine 
approach, such as gene therapy, genes can be specifically exploited to 
resensitize tumors to therapeutics. This review highlights traditional and novel 
gene targets that can be used to develop new and improved targeted therapies, 
from drug efflux proteins to ovarian cancer stem cells. The review also 
addresses the clinical relevance and landscape of the discussed gene targets."
2213,"Antiangiogenic drugs were the only mainstay of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) treatment from 2007 to 2017. However, primary or secondary resistance 
hampered their efficacy. Primary resistance could be due to different molecular 
and/or genetic characteristics of HCC and their knowledge would clarify the 
optimal treatment approach in each patient. Several molecular mechanisms 
responsible for secondary resistance have been discovered over the last few 
years; they represent potential targets for new specific drugs. In this light, 
the advent of checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has been a new opportunity; however, 
their use has highlighted other issues: the vascular normalization compared to a 
vessel pruning to promote the delivery of an active cancer immunotherapy and the 
development of resistance to immunotherapy which leads to a better selection of 
patients as candidates for ICIs. Nevertheless, the combination of antiangiogenic 
therapy plus ICIs represents an intriguing approach with high potential to 
improve the survival of these patients. Waiting for results from ongoing 
clinical trials, this review depicts the current knowledge about the resistance 
to antiangiogenic drugs in HCC. It could also provide updated information to 
clinicians focusing on the most effective combinations or sequential approaches 
in this regard, based on molecular mechanisms."
2214,"An improved understanding of relapse kinetics is required to optimize detection 
and treatment strategies for the post-transplant relapse of myeloid neoplasms. 
Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed data from 91 patients allografted for MDS 
(n = 54), AML-MRC (n = 29) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML, n = 8), 
who relapsed after transplant. Patients with early (&lt;12 months, n = 56) and 
late relapse (&gt;12 months, n = 35) were compared regarding patient-, disease- 
and transplant-related factors, including karyotype analyses at diagnosis and 
relapse. After a median follow-up of 17.4 months after relapse, late relapses 
showed improved outcomes compared with early relapses (2-yr OS 67% vs. 32%, p = 
0.0048). Comparing frequency of distinct patient-, disease- and 
transplant-related factors among early and late relapses, complex karyotype (p = 
0.0004) and unfavorable disease risk at diagnosis (p = 0.0008) as well as clonal 
evolution at relapse (p = 0.03) were more common in early than in late relapses. 
Furthermore, patients receiving transplant without prior cytoreduction or in 
complete remission were more frequently present in the group of late relapses. 
These data suggest that cytogenetics rather than disease burden at diagnosis and 
transplant-related factors determine the timepoint of post-transplant relapse 
and that upfront transplantation may be favored in order to delay relapse."
2215,"OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the incidence of anastomotic leakage (AL), risk factors 
and utility of drainage and stoma in patients undergoing intestinal surgery for 
ovarian cancer in a single institution and in a review of the literature.
METHODS: retrospective study that includes consecutive patients undergoing 
debulking surgery with en bloc pelvic resection with rectosigmoid colectomy for 
ovarian cancer between 1 November 2011 and 31 December 2021. Data regarding 
patient and tumour characteristics, surgical procedure, hospitalisation, 
complications and follow-up were recorded and analysed. The PubMed database was 
explored for recent publications on this topic.
RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were enrolled in the study. All anastomoses were 
performed at a distance of &gt;6 cm from the anal margin, with negative leak 
tests and tension-free anastomosis. Diverting stoma were performed in just three 
patients (4%). At least one perianastomotic pelvic drain was positioned in 71 
patients (94.7%) and was removed on average on postoperative day 7. Four 
patients (5.3%) experienced AL. In all cases, the drain content was not the only 
sign of complication, as the clinical signs were also highly suggestive. Just 
one patient received conservative treatment. Average postoperative 
hospitalisation was 14.6 days (SD: ±9.7). There were no deaths at 30 and 60 days 
after surgery. Between the AL and non-AL groups, statistically significant 
differences were observed for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, length of the 
intestinal resection and fitness for chemotherapy at 30 days. In ovarian cancer, 
rectosigmoid resection is a standardised procedure with comparable results for 
AL, and risk factors for AL are discretely homogeneous. What is neither 
homogeneous nor standardised according to the literature is the use of stomas 
and/or drains.
CONCLUSION: use in the future of protective stoma and/or intra-abdominal drains 
is to be explored in selected and standardised situations to verify their 
preventive role."
2216,"Although the prognosis of tonsillar cancer (human papillomavirus-positive 
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma) is improving, disease control failure 
(distant metastasis) still occurs in some cases. We explored whether several 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) parameters can 
predict metastasis. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 55 
patients with tonsil squamous cell carcinoma who underwent pretreatment 18F-FDG 
positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) followed by primary 
surgery. During the follow-up period, systemic metastases were found in 7 of the 
55 patients. The most common sites were the lungs (33%), bone (22%), brain/skull 
base (22%), small bowel (11%), and liver (11%). Pathologically, P53 mutation was 
less common in patients with systemic metastasis (41.7% vs. 14.3%, p = 0.054) 
than without systemic metastasis. In terms of PET parameters, the metabolic 
tumor volume (MTV2.5) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG2.5) values were lower in 
the primary tumor, and higher in the metastatic lymph nodes, of human 
papillomavirus (HPV)-positive compared to HPV-negative patients (all p &lt; 
0.05). The MTV2.5, TLG2.5, and tumor-to-liver uptake ratio were 36.07 ± 54.24 
cm3, 183.46 ± 298.62, and 4.90 ± 2.77, respectively, in the systemic metastasis 
group, respectively; all of these values were higher than those of the patients 
without systemic metastasis (all p &lt; 0.05). The MTV2.5 value was 
significantly different between the groups even when the values for the primary 
tumor and metastatic lymph nodes were summed (53.53 ± 57.78 cm3, p = 0.036). The 
cut-off value, area under the curve (95% confidence interval), sensitivity, and 
specificity of MTV2.5 for predicting systemic metastasis were 11.250 cm3, 0.584 
(0.036-0.832), 0.571, and 0.565, respectively. The MTV2.5 of metastatic lymph 
nodes and summed MTV2.5 values of the primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes 
were significantly higher in tonsillar cancer patients with than without 
systemic metastases. We suggest PET/CT scanning for pre-treatment cancer work-up 
and post-treatment surveillance to consider additional systemic therapy in 
patients with a high risk of disease control failure."
2217,"We investigated lung-heart toxicity and mortality in 123 women with stage I-II 
breast cancer enrolled in 2007-2011 in a prospective trial of adjuvant 
radiotherapy (TomoBreast). We were concerned whether the COVID-19 pandemic 
affected the outcomes. All patients were analyzed as a single cohort. Lung-heart 
status was reverse-scored as freedom from adverse-events (fAE) on a 1-5 scale. 
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and pulmonary function tests were 
untransformed. Statistical analyses applied least-square regression to 
calendar-year aggregated data. The significance of outliers was determined using 
the Dixon and the Grubbs corrected tests. At 12.0 years median follow-up, 103 
patients remained alive; 10-years overall survival was 87.8%. In 2007-2019, 15 
patients died, of whom 11 were cancer-related deaths. In 2020, five patients 
died, none of whom from cancer. fAE and lung-heart function declined gradually 
over a decade through 2019, but deteriorated markedly in 2020: fAE dipped 
significantly from 4.6-4.6 to 4.3-4.2; LVEF dipped to 58.4% versus the expected 
60.3% (PDixon = 0.021, PGrubbs = 0.054); forced vital capacity dipped to 2.4 L 
vs. 2.6 L (PDixon = 0.043, PGrubbs = 0.181); carbon-monoxide diffusing capacity 
dipped to 12.6 mL/min/mmHg vs. 15.2 (PDixon = 0.008, PGrubbs = 0.006). In 
conclusion, excess non-cancer mortality was observed in 2020. Deaths in that 
year totaled one-third of the deaths in the previous decade, and revealed 
observable lung-heart deterioration."
2218,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease that accounts for ~20% 
of all childhood leukemias, and more than 40% of children with AML relapse 
within three years of diagnosis. Although recent efforts have focused on 
developing a precise medicine-based approach towards treating AML in adults, 
there remains a critical gap in therapies designed specifically for children. 
Here, we present ex vivo drug sensitivity profiles for children with de novo AML 
using an automated flow cytometry platform. Fresh diagnostic blood or bone 
marrow aspirate samples were screened for sensitivity in response to 78 dose 
conditions by measuring the reduction in leukemic blasts relative to the 
control. In pediatric patients treated with conventional chemotherapy, 
comprising cytarabine, daunorubicin and etoposide (ADE), ex vivo drug 
sensitivity results correlated with minimal residual disease (r = 0.63) and one 
year relapse-free survival (r = 0.70; AUROC = 0.94). In the de novo ADE analysis 
cohort of 13 patients, AML cells showed greater sensitivity to 
bortezomib/panobinostat compared with ADE, and comparable sensitivity between 
venetoclax/azacitidine and ADE ex vivo. Two patients showed a differential 
response between ADE and bortezomib/panobinostat, thus supporting the 
incorporation of ex vivo drug sensitivity testing in clinical trials to further 
evaluate the predictive utility of this platform in children with AML."
2219,"The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing in the population aged ≤ 
49 (early-onset CRC-EOCRC). Recent studies highlighted the biological and 
clinical differences between EOCRC and late-onset CRC (LOCRC-age ≥ 50), while 
comparative results about long-term survival are still debated. This study aimed 
to investigate whether age of onset may impact on oncologic outcomes in a 
surgical population of sporadic CRC patients. Patients operated on for sporadic 
CRC from January 2010 to January 2022 were allocated to the EOCRC and LOCRC 
groups. The primary endpoint was the recurrence/progression-free survival 
(R/PFS). A total of 423 EOCRC and 1650 LOCRC was included. EOCRC had a worse 
R/PFS (p &lt; 0.0001) and cancer specific survival (p &lt; 0.0001) compared with 
LOCRC. At Cox regression analysis, age of onset, tumoral stage, signet ring 
cells, extramural/lymphovascular/perineural veins invasion, and neoadjuvant 
therapy were independent risk factors for R/P. The analysis by tumoral stage 
showed an increased incidence of recurrence in stage I EOCRC (p = 0.014), and 
early age of onset was an independent predictor for recurrence (p = 0.035). 
Early age of onset was an independent predictor for worse prognosis, this effect 
was stronger in stage I patients suggesting a potentially-and still unknown-more 
aggressive tumoral phenotype in EOCRC."
2220,"Complete pathological response (pCR) is achieved in 10-20% of rectal cancers 
when treated with short-course radiotherapy (scRT) or long-course 
chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and in 28% with total neoadjuvant therapy (scRT/CRT + 
CTX). pCR is associated with better outcomes and a ""watch-and-wait"" strategy 
(W&W). The aim of this study was to identify baseline clinical or imaging 
factors predicting pCR. All patients with preoperative treatment and delays to 
surgery in Uppsala-Dalarna (n = 359) and Stockholm (n = 635) were included. 
Comparison of pCR versus non-pCR was performed with binary logistic regression 
models. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) models for predicting pCR were 
built using factors with p &lt; 0.10 in multivariate analyses. A pCR was 
achieved in 12% of the 994 patients (scRT 8% [33/435], CRT 13% [48/358], 
scRT/CRT + CTX 21% [43/201]). In univariate and multivariate analyses, choice of 
CRT (OR 2.62; 95%CI 1.34-5.14, scRT reference) or scRT/CRT + CTX (4.70; 
2.23-9.93), cT1-2 (3.37; 1.30-8.78; cT4 reference), tumour length ≤ 3.5 cm 
(2.27; 1.24-4.18), and CEA ≤ 5 µg/L (1.73; 1.04-2.90) demonstrated significant 
associations with achievement of pCR. Age &lt; 70 years, time from radiotherapy 
to surgery &gt; 11 weeks, leucocytes ≤ 109/L, and thrombocytes ≤ 4009/L were 
significant only in univariate analyses. The associations were not fundamentally 
different between treatments. A model including T-stage, tumour length, CEA, and 
leucocytes (with scores of 0, 0.5, or 1 for each factor, maximum 4 points) 
showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.66 (95%CI 0.60-0.71) for all patients, 
and 0.65-0.73 for the three treatments separately. The choice of neoadjuvant 
treatment in combination with low CEA, short tumour length, low cT-stage, and 
normal leucocytes provide support in predicting pCR and, thus, could offer 
guidance for selecting patients for organ preservation."
2221,"BACKGROUND: Loco-regional therapy (LRT) in de novo metastatic breast cancer 
(MBC) has been investigated in several clinical trials, with heterogeneous and 
conflicting results.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of de novo MBC patients treated with 
front-line chemotherapy (FLC) followed by LRT of the primary tumor. Our aims 
were to evaluate the characteristics, treatment, and oncological outcomes in 
terms of progression-free survival (PFS), distant progression-free survival 
(DPFS), and overall survival (OS) of de novo MBC. We also investigated possible 
subgroups of patients with better outcomes according to menopausal status, 
biological sub-type, location, number of metastases, and radiologic complete 
response after FLC.
RESULTS: We included 61 patients in the study. After a median follow-up of 55 
months, disease progression occurred in 60.7% of patients and 49.2% died. There 
were no significant differences in PFS, DPFS, and OS between different subgroups 
of de novo MBC patients. A trend toward better PFS and DPFS was observed in 
triple-positive tumors, without a statistically significant difference in OS.
CONCLUSIONS: No specific subgroup of de novo MBC patients showed a statistically 
significant survival advantage after FLC followed by LRT of the primary tumor."
2222,"INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by durvalumab, an 
immune checkpoint inhibitor, is the standard treatment for locally advanced 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a 
life-threatening toxicity caused by these treatments; however, risk factors for 
the ILD have not yet been established. Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) 
are computed tomography (CT) findings which manifest as minor interstitial 
shadows. We aimed to investigate whether ILAs could be risk factors for 
grade-two or higher ILD during durvalumab therapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with NSCLC who received durvalumab after CRT from 
July 2018 to June 2021 were retrospectively enrolled. We obtained patient 
characteristics, laboratory data, radiotherapeutic parameters, and chest CT 
findings before durvalumab therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 148 patients were enrolled. The prevalence of ILAs before 
durvalumab treatment was 37.8%. Among 148 patients, 63.5% developed ILD during 
durvalumab therapy. The proportion of patients with grade-two or higher ILD was 
33.8%. The univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that older age, high 
dose-volume histogram parameters, and the presence of ILAs were significant risk 
factors for grade-two or higher ILD. The multivariate analysis showed that ILAs 
were independent risk factors for grade-two or higher ILD (odds ratio, 3.70; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.69-7.72; p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that pre-existing ILAs are risk factors for ILD during 
durvalumab treatment after CRT. We should pay attention to the development of 
grade-two or higher ILD during durvalumab treatment in patients with ILAs."
2223,"Accurate detection of HER2 expression through immunohistochemistry (IHC) is of 
great clinical significance in the treatment of breast cancer. However, manual 
interpretation of HER2 is challenging, due to the interobserver variability 
among pathologists. We sought to explore a deep learning method to predict HER2 
expression level and gene status based on a Whole Slide Image (WSI) of the HER2 
IHC section. When applied to 228 invasive breast carcinoma of no special type 
(IBC-NST) DAB-stained slides, our GrayMap+ convolutional neural network (CNN) 
model accurately classified HER2 IHC level with mean accuracy 0.952 ± 0.029 and 
predicted HER2 FISH status with mean accuracy 0.921 ± 0.029. Our result also 
demonstrated strong consistency in HER2 expression score between our system and 
experienced pathologists (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.903, 
Cohen's κ = 0.875). The discordant cases were found to be largely caused by high 
intra-tumor staining heterogeneity in the HER2 IHC group and low copy number in 
the HER2 FISH group."
2224,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a fast-growing public health 
problem and predisposes to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a significant 
proportion of patients. Metabolic alterations might underlie the progression of 
NAFLD to HCC, but the magnitudes of risk and population-attributable risk 
fractions (PAFs) for various metabolic conditions that are associated with HCC 
risk in patients with NAFLD are unknown. We investigated the associations 
between metabolic conditions and HCC development in individuals with a prior 
history of NAFLD. The study included 11,245 participants in the SEER-Medicare 
database, comprising 1310 NAFLD-related HCC cases and 9835 NAFLD controls. We 
excluded individuals with competing liver diseases (e.g., alcoholic liver 
disease and chronic viral hepatitis). Baseline pre-existing diabetes mellitus, 
dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and metabolic syndrome were 
assessed. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was used to calculate odds 
ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). PAFs were also calculated for 
each metabolic condition. The results show that diabetes (OR = 2.39, 95% CI: 
2.04-2.79), metabolic syndrome (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.49-2.01), and obesity (OR = 
1.62, 95% CI: 1.43-1.85) were associated with a higher HCC risk in individuals 
with NAFLD. The highest PAF for HCC was observed for pre-existing diabetes 
(42.1%, 95% CI: 35.7-48.5), followed by metabolic syndrome (28.8%, 95% CI: 
21.7-35.9) and obesity (13.2%, 95% CI: 9.6-16.8). The major predisposing factors 
for HCC in individuals with NAFLD are diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and 
obesity, and their control would be critically important in mitigating the 
rising incidence of NAFLD-related HCC."
2225,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) prior to surgery may 
induce early pathological responses in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC) patients. Routine imaging parameters fail to diagnose these responses 
early on. Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has proven to 
be useful for detecting HNSCC tumor mass after (chemo)radiation therapy.
METHODS: 32 patients with stage II-IV, resectable HNSCC, treated at a phase 
Ib/IIa IMCISION trial (NCT03003637), were retrospectively analyzed using 
MR-imaging before and after two doses of single agent nivolumab (anti-PD-1) (n = 
6) or nivolumab with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) ICB (n = 26). The primary tumors 
were delineated pre- and post-treatment. A total of 32 features were derived 
from the delineation and correlated with the tumor regression percentage in the 
surgical specimen.
RESULTS: MR-DWI data was available for 24 of 32 patients. Smaller baseline tumor 
diameter (p = 0.01-0.04) and higher sphericity (p = 0.03) were predictive of 
having a good pathological response to ICB. Post-treatment skewness and the 
change in skewness between MRIs were negatively correlated with the tumor's 
regression (p = 0.04, p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment DWI tumor diameter and sphericity may be quantitative 
biomarkers for the prediction of an early pathological response to ICB. 
Furthermore, our data indicate that ADC skewness could be a marker for 
individual response evaluation."
2226,"Inflammatory reactions play a crucial role in cancer progression and may 
contribute to systemic inflammation. In routine clinical practice, some 
inflammatory biomarkers can be utilized as valuable predictors for colorectal 
cancer (CRC). This study aims to determine the usefulness of a novel 
cancer-inflammation prognostic index (CIPI) marker derived from calculating 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) multiplied by the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 
(NLR) values established for non-metastatic CRCs. Between January 1995 and 
December 2018, 12,092 patients were diagnosed with stage I to III primary CRC 
and had radical resection-they were all included in this study for further 
investigation. There were 5996 (49.6%) patients in the low-CIPI group and 6096 
(50.4%) patients in the high-CIPI group according to the cutoff value of 8. For 
long-term outcomes, the high-CIPI group had a significantly higher incidence of 
recurrence (30.6% vs. 16.0%, p &lt; 0.001) and worse relapse-free survival (RFS) 
and overall survival (OS) rates (p &lt; 0.001). High CIPI was an independent 
prognostic factor for RFS and OS in univariate and multivariate analyses. This 
research is the first to document the independent significance of CIPI as a 
prognostic factor for CRC. To ensure that it works, this CIPI needs to be tested 
on more CRC prediction models."
2227,"Melanoma is among the most devastating human malignancies. Accurate diagnosis 
and prognosis are essential to offer optimal treatment. Histopathology is the 
gold standard for establishing melanoma diagnosis and prognostic features. 
However, discrepancies often exist between pathologists, and analysis is costly 
and time-consuming. Deep-learning algorithms are deployed to improve melanoma 
diagnosis and prognostication from histological images of melanoma. In recent 
years, the development of these machine-learning tools has accelerated, and 
machine learning is poised to become a clinical tool to aid melanoma histology. 
Nevertheless, a review of the advances in machine learning in melanoma histology 
was lacking. We performed a comprehensive literature search to provide a 
complete overview of the recent advances in machine learning in the assessment 
of melanoma based on hematoxylin eosin digital pathology images. In our work, we 
review 37 recent publications, compare the methods and performance of the 
reviewed studies, and highlight the variety of promising machine-learning 
applications in melanoma histology."
2228,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) oncogenesis is mainly driven by VHL gene 
inactivation, leading to overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF). The use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) directed against VEGF and 
its receptor (VEGFR) revolutionised the management of metastatic renal cancer in 
the 2000s. The more recent development of next-generation TKIs such as 
cabozantinib or lenvatinib has made it possible to bypass some of the mechanisms 
of resistance to first-generation anti-VEGFR TKIs. During the decade 2010-2020, 
the development of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies revolutionised the 
management of many solid cancers, including RCC, in first- and subsequent-line 
settings. Dual ICB or ICB plus anti-VEGFR TKI combinations are now the standard 
of care for patients with advanced clear cell RCC. To optimise these combination 
therapies while preserving patient quality of life, escalation and de-escalation 
strategies are being evaluated in prospective randomised trials, based on 
patient selection according to their prognosis risk. Finally, new therapeutic 
approaches, such as targeting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and the development 
of innovative treatments using antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), CAR-T cells, or 
radiopharmaceuticals, are all potential candidates to improve further patient 
survival."
2229,"Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1MUT) gene occur in various 
types of malignancies, including ~60% of chondrosarcomas, ~30% of intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinomas and &gt;80% of low-grade gliomas. IDH1MUT are causal in the 
development and progression of these types of cancer due to neomorphic 
production of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). Intracellular 
accumulation of D-2HG has been implicated in suppressing homologous 
recombination and renders IDH1MUT cancer cells sensitive to 
DNA-repair-inhibiting agents, such as poly-(adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose) 
polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Hyperthermia increases the efficacy of 
DNA-damaging therapies such as radiotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy, 
mainly by inhibition of DNA repair. In the current study, we investigated the 
additional effects of hyperthermia (42 °C for 1 h) in the treatment of IDH1MUT 
HCT116 colon cancer cells and hyperthermia1080 chondrosarcoma cancer cells in 
combination with radiation, cisplatin and/or a PARPi on clonogenic cell 
survival, cell cycle distribution and the induction and repair of DNA 
double-strand breaks. We found that hyperthermia in combination with radiation 
or cisplatin induces an increase in double-strand breaks and cell death, up to 
10-fold in IDH1MUT cancer cells compared to IDH1 wild-type cells. This 
vulnerability was abolished by the IDH1MUT inhibitor AGI-5198 and was further 
increased by the PARPi. In conclusion, our study shows that IDH1MUT cancer cells 
are sensitized to hyperthermia in combination with irradiation or cisplatin and 
a PARPi. Therefore, hyperthermia may be an efficacious sensitizer to cytotoxic 
therapies in tumors where the clinical application of hyperthermia is feasible, 
such as IDH1MUT chondrosarcoma of the extremities."
2230,"Background: The estimation of biological age is challenging in patients with 
cancers. We aimed to investigate frailty-based biological ages using 
frailty-discriminant scores (FDS) and examined the effect of biological-expected 
life age discrepancy on the prognosis of patients with urological cancers. 
Methods: We retrospectively evaluated frailty in 1035 patients having urological 
cancers. Their frailty-based biological age was then defined by the FDS, which 
is a comprehensive frailty assessment tool, using 1790 noncancer individuals as 
controls. An expected life age (=chronological age + life expectancy) was 
subsequently calculated using the 2019 life expectancy table. The primary 
outcome was the estimation of the biological-expected life age discrepancy 
between the frailty-based biological age and expected life age in patients with 
urological cancers. Secondary outcomes were the evaluation of the effect of the 
biological-expected life age discrepancy on overall survival. Results: We 
included 405, 466, and 164 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, urothelial 
carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma, respectively. The median chronological age, 
life expectancy, and estimated frailty-based biological age were 71, 17, and 83 
years, respectively. The biological-expected life age discrepancy in any 
urological cancers, localized diseases, and metastatic diseases was -4.8, -6.3, 
and +0.15 years, respectively. The biological-expected life age discrepancy of 
&gt;5 years was significantly associated with poor overall survival. 
Conclusions: The biological-expected life age discrepancy between frailty-based 
biological age and expected life age may be helpful in understanding the role of 
frailty and patient/doctor conversation."
2231,"Meningiomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system. 
Based on the 2021 WHO classification, they are classified into three grades 
reflecting recurrence risk and aggressiveness. However, the WHO's 
histopathological criteria defining these grades are somewhat subjective. 
Together with reliable immunohistochemical proliferation indices, other 
molecular markers such as those studied with genome-wide epigenetics promise to 
revamp the current prognostic classification. In this study, 48 meningiomas of 
various grades were randomly included and explored for DNA methylation with the 
Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray over 850k CpG sites. We conducted 
differential and correlative analyses on grade and several proliferation indices 
and markers, such as mitotic index and Ki-67 or MCM6 immunohistochemistry. We 
also set up Cox proportional hazard models for extensive associations between 
CpG methylation and survival. We identified loci highly correlated with cell 
growth and a targeted methylation signature of regulatory regions persistently 
associated with proliferation, grade, and survival. Candidate genes under the 
control of these regions include SMC4, ESRRG, PAX6, DOK7, VAV2, OTX1, and 
PCDHA-PCDHB-PCDHG, i.e., the protocadherin gene clusters. This study highlights 
the crucial role played by epigenetic mechanisms in shaping dysregulated 
cellular proliferation and provides potential biomarkers bearing prognostic and 
therapeutic value for the clinical management of meningioma."
2232,"Prophylactic and early thyroidectomy in RET germline mutation carriers allows 
the removal of the thyroid before medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) develops, or 
while it is still confined to the gland. This study was aimed to assess the 
clinicopathological features in RET carriers according to the age at surgery and 
the long-term outcomes after prophylactic and early thyroidectomy. A 
retrospective analysis of 63 operated asymptomatic RET carriers diagnosed after 
familial genetic screening was performed. Twenty-one RET carriers were operated 
at pediatric (&lt;18 yrs) and 42 at adult (≥18 yrs) age. Serum preoperative 
calcitonin levels were significantly lower in pediatric compared to adult 
patients (p = 0.04); moreover, adult RET carriers had a greater frequency of 
microMTC at pathology (p = 0.009). Permanent postoperative morbidity occurred in 
9.5% of patients, without differences between the two groups. Biochemical 
postoperative cure was achieved in all patients. At a median follow-up of 14 
years, all C-cell hyperplasia patients are disease-free; conversely, 
biochemical, and structural recurrence of disease occurred in three adults and 
one pediatric patient with microMTC. The independent predictive factors of MTC 
were the age at surgery, the preoperative calcitonin level and the RET 
mutational risk profile (p &lt; 0.02). In conclusion, prophylactic and early 
thyroidectomy are safe and effective procedures in achieving definitive cure in 
most RET carriers. However, since recurrences may occur at long-term in case of 
microMTC, thyroidectomy should be possibly performed earlier to prevent microMTC 
development."
2233,"[177Lu]Ludotadipep, which enables targeted delivery of beta-particle radiation 
to prostate tumor cells, had been suggested as a promising therapeutic option 
for mCRPC. From November 2020 to March 2022, a total of 30 patients were 
enrolled for single dose of [177Lu]Ludotadipep RPT, 6 subjects in each of the 5 
different activity groups of 1.9 GBq, 2.8 GBq, 3.7 GBq, 4.6 GBq, and 5.6 GBq. 
[177Lu]Ludotadipep was administered via venous injection, and patients were 
hospitalized for three days to monitor for any adverse effects. Serum PSA levels 
were followed up at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12, and PSMA PET/CT with 
[18F]Florastamin was obtained at baseline and again at weeks 4 and 8. The 
subjects required positive PSMA PET/CT prior to [177Lu]Ludotadipep 
administration. Among the 29 subjects who received [177Lu]Ludotadipep, 36 
treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 17 subjects (58.6%) and 4 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in 3 subjects (10.3%). Of the total 24 subjects 
who had full 12-week follow-up data, 16 (66.7%) showed decrease in PSA of any 
magnitude, and 9 (37.5%) showed a decrease in PSA by 50% or greater. A total of 
5 of the 24 patients (20.8%) showed disease progression (PSA increase of 25% or 
higher from the baseline) at the 12th week following single dose of 
[177Lu]Ludotadipep. These data thus far suggest that [177Lu]Ludotadipep could be 
a promising RPT agent with low toxicity in mCRPC patients who have not been 
responsive to conventional treatments."
2234,"We investigate whether computed tomography (CT) derived radiomics may correlate 
with driver gene mutations in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC). In this retrospective study, 47 patients (mean age 64 ± 11 years; range: 
42-86 years) with PDAC, who were treated surgically and who underwent 
preoperative CT imaging at our institution were included in the study. Image 
segmentation and feature extraction was performed semi-automatically with a 
commonly used open-source software platform. Genomic data from whole genome 
sequencing (WGS) were collected from our institution's web-based resource. Two 
statistical models were then built, in order to evaluate the predictive ability 
of CT-derived radiomics feature for driver gene mutations in PDAC. 30/47 of all 
tumor samples harbored 2 or more gene mutations. Overall, 81% of tumor samples 
demonstrated mutations in KRAS, 68% of samples had alterations in TP53, 26% in 
SMAD4 and 19% in CDKN2A. Extended statistical analysis revealed acceptable 
predictive ability for KRAS and TP53 (Youden Index 0.56 and 0.67, respectively) 
and mild to acceptable predictive signal for SMAD4 and CDKN2A (Youden Index 0.5, 
respectively). Our study establishes acceptable correlation of radiomics 
features and driver gene mutations in PDAC, indicating an acceptable 
prognostication of genomic profiles using CT-derived radiomics. A larger and 
more homogenous cohort may further enhance the predictive ability."
2235,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant neoplasm in adults among all CNS 
gliomas, with the 5-year survival rate being as low as 5%. Among nanocarriers, 
liposomal nanoformulations are considered as a promising tool for precise drug 
delivery. The herein presented study demonstrates the possibility of 
encapsulating four selected natural compounds (curcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, 
acteoside, and orientin) and their mixtures in cationic liposomal 
nanoformulation composed of two lipid types (DOTAP:POPC). In order to determine 
the physicochemical properties of the new drug carriers, specific measurements, 
including particle size, Zeta Potential, and PDI index, were applied. In 
addition, NMR and EPR studies were carried out for a more in-depth 
characterization of nanoparticles. Within biological research, the prepared 
formulations were evaluated on T98G and U-138 MG glioblastoma cell lines in 
vitro, as well as on a non-cancerous human lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) 
using the MTT test to determine their potential as anticancer agents. The 
highest activity was exhibited by liposome-entrapped acteoside towards the T98G 
cell line with IC50 equal 2.9 ± 0.9 µM after 24 hours of incubation. Noteworthy, 
curcumin and orientin mixture in liposomal formulation exhibited a synergistic 
effect against GBM. Moreover, the impact on the expression of 
apoptosis-associated proteins (p53 and Caspase-3) of acteoside as well as 
curcumin and orientin mixture, as the most potent agents, was assessed, showing 
nearly 40% increase as compared to control U-138 MG and T98G cells. It should be 
emphasized that a new and alternative method of extrusion of the studied 
liposomes was developed."
2236,"The aggressive biology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), along with 
its limited sensitivity to many systemic therapies, presents a major challenge 
in the management of patients with metastatic PDAC. Over the past decade, the 
incorporation of combinatorial cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens has improved 
patient outcomes. Despite these advances, resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy 
inevitably occurs, and there is a great need for effective therapies. A major 
focus of research has been to identify molecularly defined subpopulations of 
patients with PDAC who may benefit from targeted therapies that are matched to 
their molecular profile. Recent successes include the demonstration of the 
efficacy of maintenance PARP inhibition in PDAC tumors harboring deleterious 
BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 alterations. In addition, while therapeutic targeting of 
KRAS was long thought to be infeasible, emerging data on the efficacy of KRAS 
G12C inhibitors have increased optimism about next-generation KRAS-directed 
therapies in PDAC. Meanwhile, KRAS wild-type PDAC encompasses a unique molecular 
subpopulation of PDAC that is enriched for targetable genetic alterations, such 
as oncogenic BRAF alterations, mismatch repair deficiency, and FGFR2, ALK, NTRK, 
ROS1, NRG1, and RET rearrangements. As more molecularly targeted therapies are 
developed, precision medicine has the potential to revolutionize the treatment 
of patients with metastatic PDAC."
2237,"BACKGROUND: Most of the knowledge on spinal meningiomas is extrapolated from 
their intracranial counterparts, even though they are considered separate 
entities. This review aimed to systematically summarize studies covering 
different aspects of spinal meningiomas and their management.
METHODS: Databases were searched for all studies concerning spinal meningiomas 
dating from 2000 and onwards. When possible, a meta-analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Neurological outcomes of surgery were consistently favorable across 
studies, with a complication rate of 7.9% and 78.9% of the patients 
demonstrating good postoperative neurological function (McCormick score 1-2). 
The most relevant predictors of unfavorable outcomes were poor preoperative 
status, longer time from diagnosis to surgery, and surgery of recurrent tumors. 
The recurrence rate after surgery was estimated at 6%. Meta-analysis and/or 
survival analysis revealed that higher WHO grade (p &lt; 0.001), higher Simpson 
grade (p &lt; 0.001), ventral tumor location (p = 0.02), and male sex (p = 
0.014) were all associated with higher odds of recurrence. However, the 
meta-analysis did not show any difference between Simpson grade 1 and grade 2 
with respect to the odds of recurrence (p = 0.94). Surgery provided immediate 
and durable health-related quality-of-life improvement, as well as a high 
frequency of return to work.
CONCLUSION: Spinal meningioma surgery is a relatively safe procedure with a low 
risk of tumor recurrence and high likelihood of favorable postoperative 
outcomes."
2238,"The aim of this study was to survey the perceptions of recent (i.e., within the 
past 12 months) Australian medical graduates regarding (i) their understanding 
of the lymphatic system and lymphoedema, and (ii) the extent to which the 
lymphatic system and lymphoedema were covered as part of their medical degree. 
Medical graduates were invited to participate in a 17-item online survey that 
asked respondents to rate their level of agreement (using a 5-point Likert 
scale; higher scores = higher agreement) to statements that explored their 
understanding and comprehensiveness of their medical degree. Responses to each 
item were described using n (%). Subscale scores for understanding and medical 
degree were computed by summing scores of individual items, described using 
means (SD) and compared by participant characteristics. Medical graduates (n = 
230) perceived their understanding of the lymphatic system and lymphoedema to be 
low, and comprehensiveness of medical curricula specific to the lymphatic system 
and lymphoedema to be lacking. Subscale scores did not differ by participant 
characteristics. Improvement of medical graduates understanding of lymphoedema 
may facilitate greater awareness of lymphoedema, thus optimizing the timeliness 
of diagnosis and access to treatment."
2239,"Doublesex and Mab-3 related Transcription Factor 3 (DMRT3) is associated with 
the prognosis of some tumors. It is possible to explore the role of DMRT3 in the 
cancer process using bioinformatic approaches and experimental validation. We 
comprehensively explored the clinical and immunological characteristics of 
DMRT3. The DMRT3 expression is abnormal in human cancers and correlates with 
clinical staging. A high DMRT3 expression is significantly associated with poor 
overall survival (OS) in KIRC, KIRP, LUAD, and UCEC. Amplification was the 
greatest frequency of the DMRT3 alterations in pan-cancer. The OS was 
significantly lower in the DMRT3 altered group than in the DMRT3 unaltered group 
(P = 0.0276). The DMRT3 expression was significantly associated with MSI in 
three cancer types and TMB in six cancer types. The DMRT3 expression was 
significantly correlated with the level of the immune cell infiltration and the 
immune checkpoint genes. The DMRT3 was involved in some pathways in pan-cancer. 
DMRT3 may play a role in chemotherapy and may be associated with 
chemoresistance. A ceRNA network of KCNQ1OT1/miR-335-5p/DMRT3 was constructed in 
LUAD. DMRT3 was significantly upregulated in the LUAD cell lines. DMRT3 was 
aberrantly expressed in pan-cancer and may promote tumorigenesis and progression 
via different mechanisms. DMRT3 can be used as a therapeutic target to treat 
cancer in humans."
2240,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed 
cancers with high incidence and poor prognosis worldwide. Circ_RNF13 is 
upregulated in CRC; however, the biological roles and downstream signaling of 
circ_RNF13 remain undefined.
METHODS: The characterization of circ_RNF13 was determined by Sanger sequencing, 
qRT-PCR, subcellular fractionation assay, and RNA FISH. Western blot analysis 
and qRT-PCR were employed to detect the expression of the key molecules and 
stemness markers in CRC tumor samples and cells. The stem-like activities of CRC 
cells were assessed by sphere formation assay, flow cytometry, and 
immunofluorescence (IF). Cell viability was monitored by CCK-8 assay. The 
chemosensitivity of CRC cells was assessed by colony formation and cell 
apoptosis assays. Bioinformatics analysis, RIP assay, RNA pull-down assay, and 
FISH/IF staining were used to detect the association between circ_RNF13 and 
TRIM24. The transcriptional regulation of DDX27 was investigated by ChIP assay, 
and the post-translational regulation of TRIM24 was detected by Co-IP. The in 
vitro findings were verified in a xenograft model.
RESULTS: circ_RNF13 and DDX27 were elevated in CRC tumor samples and cells. 
Knockdown of circ_RNF13 or DDX27 inhibited stemness and increased 
chemosensitivity in CRC cells. Mechanistically, circ_RNF13 regulated DDX27 
expression via TRIM24-mediated transcriptional regulation, and circ_RNF13 
stabilized TRIM24 via suppressing FBXW7-mediated TRIM24 degradation. In vivo 
studies revealed that the knockdown of circ_RNF13 impaired stemness and enhanced 
the chemosensitivity of CRC in the xenograft model.
CONCLUSION: circ_RNF13 regulated the stemness and chemosensitivity of CRC by 
transcriptional regulation of DDX27 mediated by TRIM24 stabilization."
2241,"Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) is a non-invasive novel technique that allows 
treatment response monitoring. Studies have shown that QUS backscatter variables 
strongly correlate with changes observed microscopically. Increases in cell 
death result in significant alterations in ultrasound backscatter parameters. In 
particular, the parameters related to scatterer size and scatterer concentration 
tend to increase in relation to cell death. The use of QUS in monitoring tumor 
response has been discussed in several preclinical and clinical studies. Most of 
the preclinical studies have utilized QUS for evaluating cell death response by 
differentiating between viable cells and dead cells. In addition, clinical 
studies have incorporated QUS mostly for tissue characterization, including 
classifying benign versus malignant breast lesions, as well as responder versus 
non-responder patients. In this review, we highlight some of the important 
findings of previous preclinical and clinical studies and expand the 
applicability and therapeutic benefits of QUS in clinical settings. We 
summarized some recent clinical research advances in ultrasound-based radiomics 
analysis for monitoring and predicting treatment response and characterizing 
benign and malignant breast lesions. We also discuss current challenges, 
limitations, and future prospects of QUS-radiomics."
2242,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is associated with an increased risk of thrombotic 
complications, which remains substantial despite the implementation of 
thromboprophylaxis. The procoagulant state that characterizes the disease is 
multifactorial, and a greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is 
required to inform appropriate thrombosis prevention. Currently, there is a 
shift towards using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in this setting; 
head-to-head comparisons in the context of controlled clinical trials between 
class agents are still missing. MM-specific VTE risk assessment scores have been 
developed to optimize management and minimize the associated 
mortality/morbidity. Their clinical utility remains to be evaluated. The value 
of adding biomarkers to clinical scores to optimize their performance and 
increase their discriminatory power is also under assessment."
2243,"(1) Background: Paramagnetic seeds are a safe alternative for the wire-guided 
localisation of non-palpable breast lesions, but can also be applied for 
non-breast lesions. This study presents the experience with a paramagnetic seed, 
MagSeed® (Endomagnetics Ltd., Cambridge, UK, CE-registered and FDA-cleared), in 
an academic and non-academic breast centre. (2) Methods: Multicentre, 
retrospective analysis of 374 consecutive patients who underwent surgery after 
paramagnetic seed localisation (MSL) between 2018 and 2020. Indications for 
localisation included non-palpable breast lesions (n = 356), lymph nodes (n = 
15) or soft tissue lesions (n = 3). The primary outcome was feasibility and the 
rate of positive section margins. The secondary outcome was predictive factors 
for positive section margins. (3) Results: The accurate excision of high-risk 
breast lesions, lymph nodes and soft tissue lesions was seen in 91.07% (n = 56). 
Positive section margins were observed in 7.86% (n = 25) after breast conserving 
surgery for invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (n = 318). Invasive 
breast cancer associated with DCIS (p = 0.043) and the size of DCIS (p &lt; 
0.001) were significantly correlated with the positive section margins. (4) 
Conclusion: This study confirms the feasibility of MSL, as well as the higher 
risk for positive margins in cases of breast carcinoma with associated DCIS. 
Soft tissue lesions and lymph nodes associated with other malignancies, e.g., 
melanoma, can also be localised with paramagnetic seeds. This offers 
perspectives for future applications, such as the de-escalation of axillary 
treatment in breast cancer."
2244,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is key to tumor aggressiveness, 
therapy resistance, and immune escape in breast cancer. Because metabolic traits 
might be involved along the EMT continuum, we investigated whether human breast 
epithelial cells engineered to stably acquire a mesenchymal phenotype in 
non-tumorigenic and H-RasV12-driven tumorigenic backgrounds possess unique 
metabolic fingerprints. We profiled mitochondrial-cytosolic bioenergetic and 
one-carbon (1C) metabolites by metabolomic analysis, and then questioned the 
utilization of different mitochondrial substrates by EMT mitochondria and their 
sensitivity to mitochondria-centered inhibitors. ""Upper"" and ""lower"" glycolysis 
were the preferred glucose fluxes activated by EMT in non-tumorigenic and 
tumorigenic backgrounds, respectively. EMT in non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic 
backgrounds could be distinguished by the differential contribution of the 
homocysteine-methionine 1C cycle to the transsulfuration pathway. Both 
non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic EMT-activated cells showed elevated 
mitochondrial utilization of glycolysis end-products such as lactic acid, 
β-oxidation substrates including palmitoyl-carnitine, and tricarboxylic acid 
pathway substrates such as succinic acid. Notably, mitochondria in tumorigenic 
EMT cells distinctively exhibited a significant alteration in the electron flow 
intensity from succinate to mitochondrial complex III as they were highly 
refractory to the inhibitory effects of antimycin A and myxothiazol. Our results 
show that the bioenergetic/1C metabolic signature, the utilization rates of 
preferred mitochondrial substrates, and sensitivity to mitochondrial drugs 
significantly differs upon execution of EMT in non-tumorigenic and tumorigenic 
backgrounds, which could help to resolve the relationship between EMT, 
malignancy, and therapeutic resistance in breast cancer."
2245,"Innovation in both detection and treatment of cancer is necessary for the 
constant improvement in therapeutic strategies, especially in patients with 
novel or resistant variants of cancer. Cancer mortality rates have declined by 
almost 30% since 1991, however, depending on the cancer type, acquired 
resistance can occur to varying degrees. To combat this, researchers are looking 
towards advancing our understanding of cancer biology, in order to inform early 
detection, and guide novel therapeutic approaches. Through combination of these 
approaches, it is believed that a more complete and thorough intervention on 
cancer can be achieved. Here, we will discuss the advances and approaches in 
both detection and treatment of cancer, presented at the 58th Irish Association 
for Cancer Research (IACR) annual conference."
2246,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is an embryonic cancer that develops from neural crest stem 
cells, being one of the most common malignancies in children. The clinical 
manifestation of this disease is highly variable, ranging from spontaneous 
regression to increased aggressiveness, which makes it a major therapeutic 
challenge in pediatric oncology. The p53 family proteins p53 and TAp73 play a 
key role in protecting cells against genomic instability and malignant 
transformation. However, in NB, their activities are commonly inhibited by 
interacting proteins such as murine double minute (MDM)2 and MDMX, mutant p53, 
ΔNp73, Itch, and Aurora kinase A. The interplay between the p53/TAp73 pathway 
and N-MYC, a known biomarker of poor prognosis and drug resistance in NB, also 
proves to be decisive in the pathogenesis of this tumor. More recently, a strong 
crosstalk between microRNAs (miRNAs) and p53/TAp73 has been established, which 
has been the focused of great attention because of its potential for developing 
new therapeutic strategies. Collectively, this review provides an updated 
overview about the critical role of the p53/TAp73 pathway in the pathogenesis of 
NB, highlighting encouraging clues for the advance of alternative NB targeted 
therapies."
2247,"The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved modulator of developmental 
biology with a key role in tissue and organ size regulation under homeostatic 
conditions. Like other signaling pathways with a significant role in embryonic 
development, the deregulation of Hippo signaling contributes to oncogenesis. 
Central to the Hippo pathway is a conserved cascade of adaptor proteins and 
inhibitory kinases that converge and regulate the activity of the oncoproteins 
YAP and TAZ, the final transducers of the pathway. Elevated levels and aberrant 
activation of YAP and TAZ have been described in many cancers. Though most of 
the studies describe their pervasive activation in epithelial neoplasms, there 
is increasing evidence pointing out its relevance in mesenchymal malignancies as 
well. Interestingly, somatic or germline mutations in genes of the Hippo pathway 
are scarce compared to other signaling pathways that are frequently disrupted in 
cancer. However, in the case of sarcomas, several examples of genetic alteration 
of Hippo members, including gene fusions, have been described during the last 
few years. Here, we review the current knowledge of Hippo pathway implication in 
sarcoma, describing mechanistic hints recently reported in specific histological 
entities and how these alterations represent an opportunity for targeted therapy 
in this heterogeneous group of neoplasm."
2248,"Current imaging modalities frequently misjudge disease stage in colorectal, 
gastric and pancreatic cancer. As treatment decisions are dependent on disease 
stage, incorrect staging has serious consequences. Previous preclinical research 
and case reports indicate that prostate-specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA)-targeted PET/CT imaging might provide a solution to some of these 
challenges. This prospective clinical study aims to assess the feasibility of 
[18F]DCFPyL PET/CT imaging to target and visualize primary colon, gastric and 
pancreatic cancer. In this prospective clinical trial, patients with colon, 
gastric and pancreatic cancer were included and underwent both [18F]DCFPyL and 
[18F]FDG PET/CT scans prior to surgical resection or (for gastric cancer) 
neoadjuvant therapy. Semiquantitative analysis of immunohistochemical PSMA 
staining was performed on the surgical resection specimens, and the results were 
correlated to imaging parameters. The results of this study demonstrate 
detection of the primary tumor by [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT in 7 out of 10 patients 
with colon, gastric and pancreatic cancer, with a mean tumor-to-blood pool ratio 
(TBR) of 3.3 and mean SUVmax of 3.6. However, due to the high surrounding 
uptake, visual distinction of these tumors was difficult, and the SUVmax and TBR 
on [18F]FDG PET/CT were significantly higher than on [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT. In 
addition, no correlation between PSMA expression in the resection specimen and 
SUVmax on [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT was found. In conclusion, the detection of several 
gastrointestinal cancers using [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT is feasible. However, low 
tumor expression and high uptake physiologically in organs/background hamper the 
clear distinction of the tumor. As a result, [18F]FDG PET/CT was superior in 
detecting colon, gastric and pancreatic cancers."
2249,"With a younger tendency in morbidity age, endometrial cancer (EC) incidence has 
grown year after year. Worse, even more commonly occurring is endometrial 
hyperplasia (EH), which is a precancerous endometrial proliferation. For young 
women with early EC and EH who want to preserve fertility, progestin therapy has 
been utilized as a routine fertility-preserving treatment approach. 
Nevertheless, progestin medication failure in some patients is mostly due to 
progestin resistance and side effects. In order to further analyze the potential 
mechanisms of progestin resistance in EH and EC, to provide theoretical support 
for effective therapeutic strategies, and to lay the groundwork for searching 
novel treatment approaches, this article reviews the current therapeutic effects 
of progestin in EH and EC, as well as the mechanisms and molecular biomarkers of 
progestin resistance, and systematically expounds on the potential therapeutic 
methods to overcome progestin resistance."
2250,"Acquired immune resistance (AIR) describes a situation in which cancer patients 
who initially responded clinically to immunotherapies, after a certain period of 
time, progress with their disease. Considering that AIR represents a feedback 
response of the tumor against the immune attack generated during the course of 
immunotherapies, it is conceivable that AIR may also occur before treatment 
initiation as a mechanism to escape endogenous adaptive antitumor immunity 
(EAAI). In the present study, we assessed the EAAI in paraffin-embedded breast 
primary tumor tissue samples and drew correlations with the clinical outcomes. 
In particular, we analyzed densities of CD8+ cells as elements mediating 
antitumor cytotoxicity, and of CD163+ and FoxP3+ cells as suppressor elements. 
We found a direct correlation between the densities of CD8+ cells and of CD163+ 
and/or FoxP3+ cells in the vast majority of patients' tumors. Importantly, the 
vast majority of patients whose tumors were overpopulated by CD8+ cells 
developed AIR, which was characterized by high intratumoral CD163+ and/or FoxP3+ 
cell densities and reduced overall survival (OS). We also showed that AIR 
depends on the levels of CD8+ cell-ratios in the tumor center to the invasive 
margin. Our data suggest that tumors develop AIR only when under a robust 
endogenous immune pressure."
2251,"In metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), the clinical response to immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is limited in a subset of patients and the need 
exists to identify non-invasive, blood-based, predictive biomarkers for 
responses. We performed RNA sequencing using whole-blood samples prospectively 
collected from 49 patients with mRCC prior to the administration of ipilimumab 
(IPI) and/or nivolumab (NIVO) to determine whether gene expression profiles were 
associated with responses. An analysis from 33 mRCC patients with complete 
responses (n = 5), partial responses (n = 14), and progressive disease (n = 14) 
showed 460 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to immune responses 
between the responder and non-responder groups with significant differences. A 
set of 14 genes generated from the initial 460 DEGs accurately classified 
responders (sensitivity 94.7% and specificity 50.0%) while consensus clustering 
defined clusters with significantly differing response rates (92.3% and 35.0%). 
These clustering results were replicated in a cohort featuring 16 additional SD 
patients (49 total patients): response rates were 95.8% and 48.0%. Collectively, 
whole-blood gene expression profiles derived from mRCC patients treated with 
ICIs clearly differed by response and hierarchical clustering using immune 
response DEGs accurately classified responder patients. These results suggest 
that such screening may serve as a predictor for ICI responses in mRCC patients."
2252,"Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death, and there are 
few effective therapies for colon cancer. This study explored the use of 
coxsackievirus group B3 (CVB3) as an oncolytic virus for the treatment of colon 
cancer. In this study, we verified that CVB3 induces death of colon cancer cell 
lines by directly observing cell morphology and Western blot results, and 
observed the oncolytic effects of CVB3 by constructing an immunodeficient nude 
mice model. Our data show that CVB3 induces pyroptosis in colon cancer cell 
lines. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that CVB3 causes cleavage of gasdermin E 
(GSDME), but not gasdermin D (GSDMD), by activating caspase-3. This leads to 
production of GSDME N-termini and the development of pores in the plasma 
membrane, inducing pyroptosis of colon cancer cell lines. We also demonstrate 
that CVB3-induced pyroptosis is promoted by reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
Finally, in vivo studies using immunodeficient nude mice revealed that 
intratumoral injection of CVB3 led to significant tumor regression. Our findings 
indicate that CVB3 has oncolytic activity in colon cancer cell lines via 
GSDME-mediated pyroptosis."
2253,"Locked nucleic acid quantitative Real-Time PCR (LNA-qPCR) for IDH1/2 mutations 
in AML measurable residual disease (MRD) detection is rarely reported. LNA-qPCR 
was applied to quantify IDH1/2 mutants MRD kinetics in bone marrow from 88 
IDH1/2-mutated AML patients, and correlated with NPM1-MRD, clinical 
characteristics, and outcomes. The median normalized copy number (NCN) of IDH1/2 
mutants decreased significantly from 53,228 (range 87-980,686)/ALB × 106 at 
diagnosis to 773 (range 1.5-103,600)/ALB × 106 at first complete remission (CR). 
IDH1/2 LNA-qPCR MRD was concordant with remission status or NPM1-MRD in 79.5% 
(70/88) of patients. Younger patients and patients with FLT3 mutations had 
higher concordance. The Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) and concordance 
rate between the log reduction of IDH1/2 LNA-qPCR and NPM1-MRD were 0.68 and 81% 
(K = 0.63, 95% CI 0.50-0.74), respectively. IDH1/2-MRD &gt; 2 log reduction at 
first CR predicted significantly better relapse-free survival (3-year RFS rates 
52.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.007) and cumulative incidence of relapse (3-year CIR 
rates 44.5% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.012) compared to IDH1/2-MRD ≤ 2 log reduction. 
IDH1/2-MRD &gt; 2 log reduction during consolidation is also associated with a 
significantly lower CIR rate than IDH1/2-MRD ≤ 2 log reduction (3-year CIR rates 
42.3% vs. 68.8%, p = 0.019). LNA-qPCR for IDH1/2 mutation is a potential MRD 
technique to predict relapse in IDH1/2-mutated AML patients, especially for 
those with IDH1/2 MRD &gt; 2 log reduction at first CR or a concurrent FLT3 
mutation."
2254,"People exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) both for diagnostic and therapeutic 
purposes is constantly increasing. Since the use of IR involves a risk of 
harmful effects, such as the DNA DSB induction, an accurate determination of 
this induced DNA damage and a correct evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio in 
the clinical field are of key relevance. γH2AX (the phosphorylated form of the 
histone variant H2AX) is a very early marker of DSBs that can be induced both in 
physiological conditions, such as in the absence of specific external agents, 
and by external factors such as smoking, heat, background environmental 
radiation, and drugs. All these internal and external conditions result in a 
basal level of γH2AX which must be considered for the correct assessment of the 
DSBs after IR exposure. In this review we analyze the most common conditions 
that induce H2AX phosphorylation, including specific exogenous stimuli, cellular 
states, basic environmental factors, and lifestyles. Moreover, we discuss the 
most widely used methods for γH2AX determination and describe the principal 
applications of γH2AX scoring, paying particular attention to clinical studies. 
This knowledge will help us optimize the use of available methods in order to 
discern the specific γH2AX following IR-induced DSBs from the basal level of 
γH2AX in the cells."
2255,"Melanoma is a severe skin cancer affecting thousands of people and a growing 
public health concern worldwide. The potential hallmarks of melanoma are genetic 
instability and mutation (GIAM), which are driving mechanisms for phenotypic 
variation and adaptation in melanoma. In metastatic melanoma, DNA 
repair-associated genes are frequently expressed at higher levels than in 
primary cancers, suggesting melanoma cells rely on genetic stability to spread 
distantly. The tumour microenvironment is affected by genomic instability and 
melanoma mutation (GIMM), which plays significant roles in developing GIMM and 
their contributions to the overall disease burden. The GIAM is the crucial 
vulnerability of cancer cells, determining their sensitivity to harmful 
treatments, including radiation and many chemotherapeutics. The high incidence 
of melanoma is typically associated with genetic modifications, and several 
clinical and genetic interventions have been critical in easing the burden."
2256,"Cancer is one of the major deadly diseases globally. The alarming rise in the 
mortality rate due to this disease attracks attention towards discovering potent 
anticancer agents to overcome its mortality rate. The discovery of novel and 
effective anticancer agents from natural sources has been the main point of 
interest in pharmaceutical research because of attractive natural therapeutic 
agents with an immense chemical diversity in species of animals, plants, and 
microorganisms. More than 60% of contemporary anticancer drugs, in one form or 
another, have originated from natural sources. Plants and microbial species are 
chosen based on their composition, ecology, phytochemical, and 
ethnopharmacological properties. Plants and their derivatives have played a 
significant role in producing effective anticancer agents. Some plant 
derivatives include vincristine, vinblastine, irinotecan, topotecan, etoposide, 
podophyllotoxin, and paclitaxel. Based on their particular activity, a number of 
other plant-derived bioactive compounds are in the clinical development phase 
against cancer, such as gimatecan, elomotecan, etc. Additionally, the 
conjugation of natural compounds with anti-cancerous drugs, or some polymeric 
carriers particularly targeted to epitopes on the site of interest to tumors, 
can generate effective targeted treatment therapies. Cognizance from such 
pharmaceutical research studies would yield alternative drug development 
strategies through natural sources which could be economical, more reliable, and 
safe to use."
2257,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone tumor in children and 
adolescents characterized by drug resistance and poor prognosis. As one of the 
key oncogenes, c-Met is recognized as a promising therapeutic target for OS. In 
this report, we show that c-Met inhibitor PF02341066 specifically killed OS 
cells with highly phosphorylated c-Met in vitro. However, the inhibitory effect 
of PF02341066 was abrogated in vivo due to interference from the vascular niche. 
OS cells adjacent to microvessels or forming vascular mimicry suppressed c-Met 
expression and phosphorylation. Moreover, VEGFR2 was activated in OS cells and 
associated with acquired drug resistance. Dual targeting of c-Met and VEGFR2 
could effectively shrink the tumor size in a xenograft model. c-Met-targeted 
therapy combined with VEGFR2 inhibition might be beneficial to achieve an ideal 
therapeutic effect in OS patients. Together, our results confirm the pivotal 
role of tumor heterogeneity and the microenvironment in drug response and reveal 
the molecular mechanism underlying acquired drug resistance to c-Met-targeted 
therapy."
2258,"Reportedly, the intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channel KCa3.1 
contributes to the invasion of glioma cells into healthy brain tissue and 
resistance to temozolomide and ionizing radiation. Therefore, KCa3.1 has been 
proposed as a potential target in glioma therapy. The aim of the present study 
was to assess the variability of the temozolomide- and radiation-sensitizing 
effects conferred by the KCa3.1 blocking agent TRAM-34 between five different 
glioma cell lines grown as differentiated bulk tumor cells or under glioma stem 
cell-enriching conditions. As a result, cultures grown under stem cell-enriching 
conditions exhibited indeed higher abundances of mRNAs encoding for stem cell 
markers compared to differentiated bulk tumor cultures. In addition, stem cell 
enrichment was paralleled by an increased resistance to ionizing radiation in 
three out of the five glioma cell lines tested. Finally, TRAM-34 led to 
inconsistent results regarding its tumoricidal but also temozolomide- and 
radiation-sensitizing effects, which were dependent on both cell line and 
culture condition. In conclusion, these findings underscore the importance of 
testing new drug interventions in multiple cell lines and different culture 
conditions to partially mimic the in vivo inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity."
2259,"BACKGROUND: HER2-Low status is found in approximately half of breast cancer 
patients and shows potential benefits from novel antibody-drug conjugates 
(ADCs). Data on the accuracy of HER2-Low status between core needle biopsy (CNB) 
and surgical excision specimen (SES) samples are lacking. We aimed to 
investigate the accuracy of HER2-Low status diagnosis between CNB and SES 
samples.
METHODS: Consecutive early-stage breast cancer patients who underwent surgery 
from January 2009 to March 2022 with paired CNB and SES samples were 
retrospectively reviewed. HER2-Low was defined as IHC 1+ or IHC2+ and 
FISH-negative. Concordance rates were analyzed by the Kappa test. Further 
clinicopathological characteristics were compared among different HER2 status 
and their changes.
RESULTS: A total of 5610 patients were included, of whom 3209 (57.2%) and 3320 
(59.2%) had HER2-Low status in CNB and SES samples, respectively. The 
concordance rate of HER2 status in the whole population was 82.37% (Kappa = 
0.684, p &lt; 0.001), and was 76.87% in the HER2-Negative patients (Kappa = 
0.372, p &lt; 0.001). Among 1066 HER2-0 cases by CNB, 530 patients were 
classified as HER2-Low tumors. On the contrary, in 3209 patients with HER2-Low 
tumor by CNB, 387 were scored as HER2-0 on the SES samples. ER-negative or Ki67 
high expression tumor by CNB had a high concordance rate of HER2-Low status.
CONCLUSIONS: A relatively low concordance rate was found when evaluating 
HER2-Low status between CNB and SES samples in HER2-Negative breast cancer 
patients, indicating the necessity of retesting HER2 low status at surgery, 
which may guide further therapy in the era of anti-HER2 ADCs."
2260,"Therapies with the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitors 
are not fully curative for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients. Here, we 
propose that some mTORC1-independent disease facets of TSC involve signaling 
through redox factor-1 (Ref-1). Ref-1 possesses a redox signaling activity that 
stimulates the transcriptional activity of STAT3, NF-kB, and HIF-1α, which are 
involved in inflammation, proliferation, angiogenesis, and hypoxia, 
respectively. Here, we demonstrate that redox signaling through Ref-1 
contributes to metabolic transformation and tumor growth in TSC cell model 
systems. In TSC2-deficient cells, the clinically viable Ref-1 inhibitor APX3330 
was effective at blocking the hyperactivity of STAT3, NF-kB, and HIF-1α. While 
Ref-1 inhibitors do not inhibit mTORC1, they potently block cell invasion and 
vasculature mimicry. Of interest, we show that cell invasion and vasculature 
mimicry linked to Ref-1 redox signaling are not blocked by mTORC1 inhibitors. 
Metabolic profiling revealed that Ref-1 inhibitors alter metabolites associated 
with the glutathione antioxidant pathway as well as metabolites that are heavily 
dysregulated in TSC2-deficient cells involved in redox homeostasis. Therefore, 
this work presents Ref-1 and associated redox-regulated transcription factors 
such as STAT3, NF-kB, and HIF-1α as potential therapeutic targets to treat TSC, 
where targeting these components would likely have additional benefits compared 
to using mTORC1 inhibitors alone."
2261,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors 
of the gastrointestinal tract. Gain of function in receptor tyrosine kinases 
type III, KIT, or PDGFRA drives the majority of GIST. Previously, our group 
reported that silencing of the adaptor molecule SH3 Binding Protein 2 (SH3BP2) 
downregulated KIT and PDGFRA and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor 
(MITF) levels and reduced tumor growth. This study shows that SH3BP2 silencing 
also decreases levels of ETV1, a required factor for GIST growth. To dissect the 
SH3BP2 pathway in GIST cells, we performed a miRNA array in SH3BP2-silenced GIST 
cell lines. Among the most up-regulated miRNAs, we found miR-1246 and miR-5100 
to be predicted to target MITF and ETV1. Overexpression of these miRNAs led to a 
decrease in MITF and ETV1 levels. In this context, cell viability and cell cycle 
progression were affected, and a reduction in BCL2 and CDK2 was observed. 
Interestingly, overexpression of MITF enhanced cell proliferation and 
significantly rescued the viability of miRNA-transduced cells. Altogether, the 
KIT-SH3BP2-MITF/ETV1 pathway deserves to be considered in GIST cell survival and 
proliferation."
2262,"BACKGROUND: There are limited published data in the Canadian healthcare system 
on the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) among patients with 
breast cancer. This study characterized real-world G-CSF use during the period 
surrounding the introduction of filgrastim biosimilar.
METHODS: Electronic medical records were reviewed retrospectively for patients 
with breast cancer who received moderately or highly myelosuppressive 
(neo)adjuvant chemotherapy from 2008 to 2019 in Alberta, Canada. Trends in G-CSF 
usage were plotted to elucidate temporal variations and multivariable regression 
models were constructed to identify clinical factors associated with G-CSF use.
RESULTS: We included 6662 patients in our analyses. G-CSF was used in 57.1% of 
patients during their treatment trajectory. Among the 3801 patients who were 
treated with G-CSF, the majority received pegfilgrastim only (91.5%; n = 3477) 
versus filgrastim only (5.7%; n = 217). G-CSF use increased linearly more than 
two-fold over the 11-year study period. Predictors of G-CSF use included younger 
age, south zone of residence, higher neighborhood education, inferior disease 
stage, highly neutropenic risk chemotherapy, and more recent chemotherapy 
initiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing G-CSF usage over time, an appreciable proportion 
of patients for whom G-CSF prophylaxis is recommended did not receive it. G-CSF 
use could be further optimized to align with supportive care clinical guidelines 
and reduce the impact of neutropenia and its associated complications."
2263,"The aim of this retrospective study is to compare the two boost subgroups, IORT 
or IMRT, in terms of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), 
cosmesis, and acute and late toxicity. It shall be shown whether and which of 
the boost techniques offers better results with respect to the facial points, 
since there are already many studies on applying boost to the tumor bed 
after/during breast conserving surgery, and there are few which compare the 
different techniques. For this comparison, two subgroups of 76 patients each (n 
= 152), treated between 2002 and 2015, were enrolled in the study. In one 
subgroup, the 9 Gy boost was intraoperatively administered after complete 
removal of the primary tumor, while the other subgroup received the boost of 8.4 
Gy percutaneously and simultaneously integrated into the tumor bed after breast 
conserving surgery. Both subgroups have subsequently undergone whole breast 
irradiation (WBI) of 50.4/50 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy per fraction. OS and the incidence 
of late toxicity did not differ between the two subgroups and no risk factor was 
found regarding PFS. Acute toxicities initially occurred significantly less (p 
&lt; 0.001) in the IORT subgroup; however, after WBI took place, this difference 
vanished. Therefore, boost application by means of IORT or IMRT can be 
considered equivalent."
2264,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Although 
not frequent, it has a relevant social impact because the peak incidence 
coincides with the age of professional maturity. A number of novel treatments 
have been proposed, yet clinical trials have been disappointing. Recently, a 
phase II clinical trial (REGOMA) demonstrated that the multikinase inhibitor 
regorafenib significantly increased the median overall survival (OS) of GBM 
patients when compared to lomustine-treated patients. On this basis, the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2020 Guidelines included 
regorafenib as a preferred regimen in relapsed GBM treatment. Despite the use in 
GBM patients' therapy, little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing 
regorafenib effectiveness on the GBM tumor. Here we report an in vitro 
characterization of GBM tumor cells' response to regorafenib, performed both on 
cell lines and on patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs). Overall, regorafenib 
significantly reduced cell growth of 2D tumor cell cultures and of 3D tumor 
spheroids. Strikingly, this effect was accompanied by transcriptional regulation 
of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes and by an increased ability 
of surviving tumor cells to invade the surrounding matrix. Taken together, our 
data suggest that regorafenib limits cell growth, however, it might induce an 
invasive phenotype."
2265,"Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) 
scans have higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting lymph nodes or 
metastatic disease relative to conventional imaging in prostate cancer staging. 
Since its FDA approval and incorporation into treatment guidelines, the use of 
PSMA PET has increased in patients undergoing initial staging, those with 
recurrence after initial definitive treatment, and patients with metastatic 
disease. Although the early detection of metastatic lesions is changing disease 
management, it is unclear whether this impact on management translates into 
clinical benefit. This review will summarize evidence pertaining to the change 
in patient management due to PSMA PET use and will discuss the implications of 
PSMA PET on treatment decisions in prostate cancer, particularly in the settings 
of biochemical recurrence and metachronous oligometastatic disease."
2266,"BACKGROUND: In patients affected by head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the 
onset of severe oral mucositis is a decisive factor in completing concurrent 
chemo-radiotherapy, and few interventions have demonstrated a modest benefit. 
The primary aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the role of SAMITAL in 
reducing the incidence of severe mucositis induced by concurrent 
chemo-radiotherapy; the secondary aims were the tolerability and 
patient-reported quality of life measures.
METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive SAMITAL granules for oral 
suspension of 20 mL, four-time daily or matching placebo in a 1:1 fashion using 
a stratified-block randomization scheme by disease site and type of 
chemotherapy. The SAMITAL/placebo was dispensed at the baseline visit and at 
each weekly visit following radiotherapy initiation. Patients were subjected to 
weekly endoscopic evaluations to assess the presence of mucositis. In addition, 
patient-reported outcomes were measured.
RESULTS: Among the 116 patients treated with a median total dose of 66 Gy, 59 
were randomized to SAMITAL and 57 to placebo. Overall, the incidence of severe 
mucositis was 51.7%, with 45.8% in the SAMITAL and 57.9% in the placebo arm (OR 
= 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3-1.3). After chemo-radiotherapy, patients randomized to 
SAMITAL reported significantly lower xerostomia, coughing and swallowing scores 
and a better quality of life.
CONCLUSION: SAMITAL did not significantly reduce the incidence of severe 
mucositis in all studied populations. However, the lower rate of mucositis, 
together with a significantly better quality of life, suggested that a clinical 
benefit existed. This trial is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register 
database, number 2012-002046-20, and with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01941992."
2267,"The Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and 
is an essential bile acid (BA) receptor that regulates the expression of genes 
involved in the metabolism of BAs. FXR protects the liver from BA overload, 
which is a major etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma. Herein, we investigated 
the changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in hepatocytes by 
performing RNA-seq in combination with the Assay for Transposase-Accessible 
Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) using a novel FXR knockout 
mouse model (Fxrex5Δ: Nr1h4ex5Δ/ex5Δ) generated through CRISPR/Cas9. Consistent 
with previous Fxr knockout models, we found that Fxrex5Δ mice develop late-onset 
HCC associated with increased serum and hepatic BAs. FXR deletion was associated 
with a dramatic loss of chromatin accessibility, primarily at 
promoter-associated transcription factor binding sites. Importantly, several 
genes involved in BA biosynthesis and circadian rhythm were downregulated 
following loss of FXR, also displayed reduced chromatin accessibility at their 
promoter regions. Altogether, these findings suggest that FXR helps to maintain 
a transcriptionally active state by regulating chromatin accessibility through 
its binding and recruitment of transcription factors and coactivators."
2268,"Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is highly prevalent within the U.S., with studies 
estimating that over 80% of individuals will contract the virus in their 
lifetime. HPV is considered a primary risk factor for the development and 
progression of oropharyngeal cancers. The impact of the HPV virus's E6 and E7 
oncoproteins on cellular signaling pathways and genomic integration has been 
extensively characterized. Indirect genomic effects; however, remain relatively 
unidentified. In this study, we analyzed 83 HPV+ Head and Neck Squamous Cell 
Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients of varying HPV types. Expression counts of the HPV E6 
and E7 oncogenes were estimated across samples and correlated with genomic 
mutational classes. High expression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins was associated 
with a greater number of total point mutations, especially on chromosomes 1, 11, 
and 17, which have been implicated in HPV-mediated cancers in previous studies. 
Samples with high E6 and E7 expression also exhibited more frequent 
non-clustered structural variation and a lack of clustered variation altogether. 
Copy number segments were present with fewer number of repeats in high E6 and E7 
expression samples, which is known to correlate with decreased expression of 
affected genes. E6 and E7 expression was associated with increased activity of 
several cellular pathways associated in oncogenesis and telomere maintenance. In 
comprehensively characterizing the effects of the HPV oncoproteins on the human 
genome, potential mechanisms of HNSCC pathogenesis may be further elucidated."
2269,"Prostate cancer-associated deaths arise from disease progression and metastasis. 
Metastasis to the liver is associated with the worst clinical outcomes for 
prostate cancer patients, and these metastatic tumors can be particularly 
resistant to the currently widely used chemotherapy and hormonal therapies, such 
as anti-androgens which block androgen synthesis or directly target the androgen 
receptor. The incidence of liver metastases is reportedly increasing, with a 
potential correlation with use of anti-androgen therapies. A key player in 
prostate cancer progression and therapeutic response is the microenvironment of 
the tumor(s). This is a dynamic and adaptive collection of cells and proteins, 
which impart signals and stimuli that can alter biological processes within 
prostate cancer cells. Investigation in the prostate primary site has 
demonstrated that cells of the microenvironment are also responsive to hormones 
and hormonal therapies. In this review, we collate information about what 
happens when cancer moves to the liver: the types of prostate cancer cells that 
metastasize there, the response of resident mesenchymal cells of the liver, and 
how the interactions between the cancer cells and the microenvironment may be 
altered by hormonal therapy."
2270,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive malignant tumor with a high 
mortality rate. It is urgent to find optimal molecular targets for the early 
diagnosis and treatment of PC. Here, we aimed to systematically analyze the 
prognostic, diagnostic, and clinicopathological significance of circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) in PC. Relevant studies were screened through PubMed, Web of Science, 
and other databases. The prognostic value of PC-associated circRNAs was assessed 
using the composite hazard ratio (HR), the diagnostic performance was assessed 
using the area under the summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve 
(AUC), and the correlation with clinicopathological characteristics using the 
composite odds ratio (OR) was explored. In our study, 48 studies were included: 
34 for prognosis, 11 for diagnosis, and 30 for correlation with 
clinicopathological characteristics. For prognosis, upregulated circRNAs were 
associated with poorer overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.02) and disease-free 
survival/progression-free survival (HR = 1.84) while downregulated circRNAs were 
associated with longer OS (HR = 0.55). Notably, the combination of circRNAs, 
including hsa_circ_0064288, hsa_circ_0000234, hsa_circ_0004680, 
hsa_circ_0071036, hsa_circ_0000677, and hsa_circ_0001460, was associated with 
worse OS (HR = 2.35). For diagnosis, the AUC was 0.83, and the pooled 
sensitivity and specificity were 0.79 and 0.73, respectively. For 
clinicopathologic characteristics, upregulated circRNAs were associated with 
poorer tumor differentiation, more nerve and vascular invasion, higher T stage, 
lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis, advanced TNM stage, and higher 
preoperative CA19-9 level. In contrast, downregulated circRNAs were negatively 
associated with PC differentiation and lymphatic metastasis. Overall, our 
results showed that circRNAs are closely related to the prognosis and 
clinicopathological characteristics of PC patients and could be utilized for 
early diagnosis; thus, they are promising biomarkers for clinical application in 
PC."
2271,"Canine apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinoma (AGASACA) is an aggressive canine 
tumor originating from the anal sac glands. Surgical resection, with or without 
adjuvant chemotherapy, represents the standard of care for this tumor, but the 
outcome is generally poor, particularly for tumors diagnosed at an advanced 
stage. For this reason, novel treatment options are warranted, and a few recent 
reports have suggested the activation of the immune checkpoint axis in canine 
AGASACA. In our study, we developed canine-specific monoclonal antibodies 
targeting PD-1 and PD-L1. A total of 41 AGASACAs with complete clinical and 
follow-up information were then analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the 
expression of the two checkpoint molecules (PD-L1 and PD-1) and the presence of 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3 and CD20), which were evaluated within the 
tumor bulk (intratumor) and in the surrounding stroma (peritumor). Seventeen 
AGASACAs (42%) expressed PD-L1 in a range between 5% and 95%. The intratumor 
lymphocytes were predominantly CD3+ T-cells and were positively correlated with 
the number of PD-1+ intratumor lymphocytes (ρ = 0.36; p = 0.02). The peritumor 
lymphocytes were a mixture of CD3+ and CD20+ cells with variable PD-1 expression 
(range 0-50%). PD-L1 expression negatively affected survival only in the 
subgroup of dogs treated with surgery alone (n = 14; 576 vs. 235 days). The 
presence of a heterogeneous lymphocytic infiltrate and the expression of PD-1 
and PD-L1 molecules support the relevance of the immune microenvironment in 
canine AGASACAs and the potential value of immune checkpoints as promising 
therapeutic targets."
2272,"The TNM classification system is one of the most important factors determining 
prognosis for cancer patients. In colorectal cancer, the T category reflects the 
depth of tumor invasion. T3 is defined by a tumor that invades through the 
muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues. The data of 1047 patients with 
complete mesocolic excision were analyzed. The depth of invasion beyond the 
outer border of the muscularis propria into the subserosa or into 
nonperitonealized pericolic tissue was measured and categorized in 655 pT3 
patients: pT3a (≤1 mm), pT3b,c (&gt;1-15 mm) and pT3d (&gt;15 mm). The prognosis 
of these categories was compared. Five-year distant metastasis increased 
significantly from pT3a (5.7%) over pT3b,c (17.7%) to pT3d (37.2%; p = 0.001). 
There was no difference between pT2 (5.3%) and pT3a or between pT3d and pT4a 
(42.1%) or pT4b (33.7%). The 5-year disease-free survival decreased 
significantly from pT3a (77.4%) over pT3b,c (65.4%) to pT3d (50.1%; p = 0.015). 
No significant difference was found between pT2 (80.5%) and pT3a or between pT3d 
and pT4a (43.9%; p = 0.296) or pT4b (53.4%). The prognostic inhomogeneity in pT3 
colon carcinoma has been demonstrated. A three-level subdivision of T3 for colon 
carcinoma in the TNM system into T3a (≤1 mm), T3b (&gt;1-15 mm), and T3c (&gt;15 
mm) is recommended."
2273,"(1) Cases of cancer are expected to increase in the next years and the risk of 
cancer increases with age. Data 2016-2019 from the Italian population-based 
surveillance PASSI d'Argento (PdA) allow the description of the physical and 
psychosocial well-being of people aged ≥65 years diagnosed with cancer (Ca), and 
the comparison with elderly suffering from other chronic conditions (Ch) and 
healthy older individuals (H). (2) Data are collected by Local Health Units' 
professionals using a standardized questionnaire during telephone interviews. 
(3) A total of 8051 out of the 56,352 interviewees reported a previous diagnosis 
of cancer: an annual average cancer prevalence of 12.8% (95% CI 12.4-13.3%) 
corresponding to 1.725 million elderly residing in Italy. In comparison to the 
H, Ca were more likely to refer bad health (aPR = 4.21; 95% CI: 3.70-4.79), 
suffer from depressive symptoms (aPR = 2.65; 95% CI: 2.35-2.99), disability (aPR

provides valuable information to researchers and policy-makers by showing the 
difficulties for older people with cancer in contributing socially and accessing 
basic social and health services, which amplifies the risk of cognitive decline, 
isolation, and psychological deterioration."
2274,"The loss-of-function variants are thought to be associated with inflammation in 
the stomach. We here aimed to evaluate the extent and role of methylation at the 
SSTR2 promoter in inflammation and gastric tumor formation. A whole-genome 
bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed that the SSTR2 promoter was significantly 
hypermethylated in gastric tumors, dysplasia, and intestinal metaplasia compared 
to non-tumor tissues from patients with gastric cancer. Using public data, we 
confirmed SSTR2 promoter methylation in primary gastric tumors and intestinal 
metaplasia, and even aged gastric mucosae infected with Helicobacter pylori, 
suggesting that aberrant methylation is initiated in normal gastric mucosa. The 
loss-of-function of SSTR2 in SNU638 cell-induced cell proliferation in vitro, 
while stable transfection of SSTR2 in AGS and MKN74 cells inhibited cell 
proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. As revealed by a 
comparison of target genes differentially expressed in these cells with hallmark 
molecular signatures, inflammation-related pathways were distinctly induced in 
SSTR2-KO SNU638 cell. By contrast, inflammation-related pathways were inhibited 
in AGS and MKN74 cells ectopically expressing SSTR2. Collectively, we propose 
that SSTR2 silencing upon promoter methylation is initiated in aged gastric 
mucosae infected with H. pylori and promotes the establishment of an 
inflammatory microenvironment via the intrinsic pathway. These findings provide 
novel insights into the initiation of gastric carcinogenesis."
2275,"OBJECTIVES: Combined immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy and chemotherapy 
has become the standard treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). Pleural effusion (PE) is associated with poor outcomes among patients 
with NSCLC undergoing chemotherapy. However, minimal data exists on PE for 
patients undergoing combined ICI and chemotherapy. Therefore, we investigated 
how PE affects survival outcomes in patients with NSCLC undergoing this combined 
therapy.
METHODS: We identified patients with advanced NSCLC undergoing chemotherapy and 
ICI therapy from the Okayama Lung Cancer Study Group-Immune Chemotherapy 
Database (OLCSG-ICD) between December 2018 and December 2020; the OLCSG-ICD 
includes the clinical data of patients with advanced NSCLC from 13 institutions. 
Then, we analyzed the treatment outcomes based on the presence of PE.
RESULTS: We identified 478 patients who underwent combined ICI therapy and 
chemotherapy; 357 patients did not have PE, and 121 patients did have PE. 
Patients with PE had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) than those without PE (median PFS: 6.2 months versus 9.1 
months; p &lt; 0.001; median OS: 16.4 months versus 27.7 months; p &lt; 0.001). 
The negative effect of PE differed based on the patient's programmed cell 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression status; with the effect being more evident in 
patients with high PD-L1 expression. In addition, PFS and OS did not differ 
between patients who did and did not undergo bevacizumab treatment; thus, 
bevacizumab-containing regimens did not improve the survival outcomes for 
patients with PE.
CONCLUSION: PE is associated with poor outcomes among patients with NSCLC 
undergoing combined ICI therapy and chemotherapy."
2276,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown potential for facilitating the detection 
and classification of tumors. In patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 
distinguishing between the most common subtypes, adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 
squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), is crucial for the development of an effective 
treatment plan. This task, however, may still present challenges in clinical 
routine. We propose a two-modality, AI-based classification algorithm to detect 
and subtype tumor areas, which combines information from matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data and digital 
microscopy whole slide images (WSIs) of lung tissue sections. The method 
consists of first detecting areas with high tumor cell content by performing a 
segmentation of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E-stained) WSIs, and 
subsequently classifying the tumor areas based on the corresponding MALDI MSI 
data. We trained the algorithm on six tissue microarrays (TMAs) with tumor 
samples from N = 232 patients and used 14 additional whole sections for 
validation and model selection. Classification accuracy was evaluated on a test 
dataset with another 16 whole sections. The algorithm accurately detected and 
classified tumor areas, yielding a test accuracy of 94.7% on spectrum level, and 
correctly classified 15 of 16 test sections. When an additional quality control 
criterion was introduced, a 100% test accuracy was achieved on sections that 
passed the quality control (14 of 16). The presented method provides a step 
further towards the inclusion of AI and MALDI MSI data into clinical routine and 
has the potential to reduce the pathologist's work load. A careful analysis of 
the results revealed specific challenges to be considered when training neural 
networks on data from lung cancer tissue."
2277,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteolytic enzymes that play a crucial 
role in tumor microenvironment remodeling, contributing to inflammatory and 
angiogenic processes, and ultimately promoting tumor maintenance and 
progression. Several studies on bioactive polypeptides isolated from legumes 
have shown anti-migratory, anti-MMPs, and anti-tumor effects, potentially 
constituting novel strategies for both the prevention and progression of cancer. 
In this work, we investigated the anti-tumor role of deflamin, a protein 
oligomer isolated from white lupine seeds (Lupinus albus) reported to inhibit 
MMP-9 and cell migration in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. We found that 
deflamin exerts an inhibitory effect on tumor growth and metastasis formation, 
contributing to increased tumor apoptosis in the xenotransplanted zebrafish 
larvae model. Furthermore, deflamin resulted not only in a significant reduction 
in MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity but also in impaired cancer cell migration and 
invasion in vitro. Using the xenograft zebrafish model, we observed that 
deflamin inhibits collagen degradation and angiogenesis in the tumor 
microenvironment in vivo. Overall, our work reveals the potential of deflamin as 
an agent against CRC development and progression."
2278,"Environmental factors are established contributors to thyroid carcinomas. Due to 
their known ability to cause cancer, exposure to several organic and inorganic 
chemical toxicants and radiation from nuclear weapons, fallout, or medical 
radiation poses a threat to global public health. Halogenated substances like 
organochlorines and pesticides can interfere with thyroid function. Like 
phthalates and bisphenolates, polychlorinated biphenyls and their metabolites, 
along with polybrominated diethyl ethers, impact thyroid hormones biosynthesis, 
transport, binding to target organs, and impair thyroid function. A deeper 
understanding of environmental exposure is crucial for managing and preventing 
thyroid cancer. This review aims to investigate the relationship between 
environmental factors and the development of thyroid cancer."
2279,"Biological but not chronological age plus performance have more impact on 
decision making in glioblastoma patients. We investigated how progression-free 
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in older patients with IDH wild-type 
glioblastoma were influenced by concomitant radio-chemotherapy and MGMT promotor 
methylation status in real-life settings. In total, 142 out of 273 (52%) 
evaluated patients were older than 65 years, and 77 (55%) of them received 
concomitant radio-chemotherapy. In senior patients, the initiation of 
concomitant radio-chemotherapy was associated with significantly better PFS: 
15.3 months (CI95: 11.7-18.9) vs. 7.0 months (CI95: 4.3-9.6; p = 0.002). The 
favorable influence on PFS was not related to MGMT promotor methylation status 
as it was in the younger cohort. In seniors, concomitant radio-chemotherapy was 
related to significantly better OS: 20.0 months (CI95: 14.3-26.7) vs. 4.9 months 
(CI95: 3.5-6.2), p &lt; 0.001. MGMT promotor methylation was related to a more 
favorable OS only, if concomitant radio-chemotherapy was initiated. In 
conclusion, more than half of the glioblastoma cohort was older than 65 years of 
age. Even if PFS and OS were shorter than in the younger cohort, concomitant 
radio-chemotherapy provided a survival advantage. In real life, MGMT promotor 
methylation had a positive impact on OS only if the adjuvant therapy was 
applied."
2280,"In recent years, the third member of the HER family, kinase impaired HER3, has 
become a target of interest in cancer as there is accumulating evidence that 
HER3 plays a role in tumor growth and progression. This review focuses on HER3 
activation in bladder, breast, colorectal, and lung cancer disease progression. 
HER3 mutations occur at a rate up to ~10% of tumors dependent on the tumor type. 
With patient tumors routinely sequenced for gene alterations in recent years, we 
have focused on HER3 mutations in bladder, breast, colon, and lung cancers 
particularly in response to targeted therapies and the potential to become a 
resistance mechanism. There are currently several HER3 targeting drugs in the 
pipeline, possibly improving outcomes for cancer patients with tumors containing 
HER3 activation and/or alterations."
2281,"BACKGROUND: Despite its toxicity, modified FOLFIRINOX is the main chemotherapy 
for localized, operable pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Sarcopenia is known as a 
factor in lower overall survival (OS). The purpose of this study was to assess 
the impact of sarcopenia on OS in patients with localized pancreatic ductal 
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who received modified FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine as 
adjuvant chemotherapy.
METHODS: Patients with operated PDAC who received gemcitabine-based (GEM group) 
or oxaliplatin-based (OXA group) adjuvant chemotherapy between 2008 and 2021 
were retrospectively included. Sarcopenia was estimated on a baseline computed 
tomography (CT) examination using the skeletal muscular index (SMI). The primary 
evaluation criterion was OS. Secondary evaluation criteria were disease-free 
survival (DFS) and toxicity.
RESULTS: Seventy patients treated with gemcitabine-based (n = 49) and 
oxaliplatin-based (n = 21) chemotherapy were included, with a total of fifteen 
sarcopenic patients (eight in the GEM group and seven in the OXA group). The 
median OS was shorter in sarcopenic patients (25 months) compared to 
non-sarcopenic patients (158 months) (p = 0.01). A longer OS was observed in GEM 
non-sarcopenic patients (158 months) compared to OXA sarcopenic patients (14.4 
months) (p &lt; 0.01). The median OS was 157.7 months in the GEM group vs. 34.1 
months in the OXA group (p = 0.13). No differences in median DFS were found 
between the GEM group and OXA group. More toxicity events were observed in the 
OXA group (50%) than in the GEM group (10%), including vomiting (p = 0.02), 
mucositis (p = 0.01) and neuropathy (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia is associated with a worse prognosis in patients with 
localized operated PDAC whatever the delivered adjuvant chemotherapy."
2282,"The treatment of HER2-positive cancers has changed significantly over the past 
ten years thanks to a significant number of promising new approaches that have 
been added to our arsenal in the fight against cancer, including monoclonal 
antibodies, inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, antibody-drug conjugates, 
vaccination, and particularly, adoptive-T-cell therapy after its great success 
in hematological malignancies. Equally important is the new methodology for 
determining patients eligible for targeted HER2 therapy, which has doubled the 
number of patients who can benefit from these treatments. However, despite the 
initial enthusiasm, there are still several problems in this field represented 
by drug resistance and tumor recurrence that require the further development of 
new more efficient drugs. In this review, we discuss various approaches for 
targeting the HER2 molecule in cancer treatment, highlighting their benefits and 
drawbacks, along with the different mechanisms responsible for resistance to 
HER2-targeted therapies and how to overcome them."
2283,"Two vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, FLT-1 and KDR, are 
expressed preferentially in proliferating endothelium. There is increasing 
evidence that recombinant, soluble VEGF receptor domains interfering with VEGF 
signaling may inhibit in vivo neoangiogenesis, tumor growth and metastatic 
spread. We hypothesized that a soluble form of FLT-1 receptor (sFLT-1) could 
inhibit the growth of pre-established tumors via an anti-angiogenic mechanism. A 
replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad) vector carrying the sflt-1 cDNA (Adsflt) 
was used to overexpress the sFLT-1 receptor in a breast cancer animal model. 
MCF-7 cells, which produce VEGF, were used to establish solid tumors in the 
mammary fat pads of female nude mice. After six weeks, tumors were injected 
either with Adsflt or a negative control virus (AdCMV.βgal). After six months, 
average tumor volume in the Adsflt-infected group (33 ± 22 mm3) decreased by 91% 
relative to that of the negative control group (388 ± 94 mm3; p &lt; 0.05). 
Moreover, 10 of 15 Adsflt-infected tumors exhibited complete regression. The 
vascular density of Adsflt-infected tumors was reduced by 50% relative to that 
of negative controls (p &lt; 0.05), which is consistent with sFLT-1-mediated 
tumor regression through an anti-angiogenic mechanism. Moreover, cell necrosis 
and fibrosis associated with long-term regression of Adsflt-infected tumors were 
preceded by apoptosis of tumor vascular endothelial cells. Mice treated with 
Adsflt intratumorally showed no delay in the healing of cutaneous wounds, 
providing preliminary evidence that Ad-mediated sFLT-1 overexpression may be an 
effective anti-angiogenic therapy for cancer without the risk of systemic 
anti-angiogenic effects."
2284,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common lung cancer type which 
accounts for the majority (~85%) of all lung cancer cases [...]."
2285,"Cancer research has benefited immensely from the use of animal models. Several 
genetic tools accessible in rodent models have provided valuable insight into 
cellular and molecular mechanisms linked to cancer development or metastasis and 
various lines are available. However, at the same time, it is important to 
accompany these findings with those from alternative or non-model animals to 
offer new perspectives into the understanding of tumor development, prevention, 
and treatment. In this review, we first discuss animals characterized by little 
or no tumor development. Cancer incidence in small animals, such as the naked 
mole rat, blind mole rat and bats have been reported as almost negligible and 
tumor development may be inhibited by increased defense and repair mechanisms, 
altered cell cycle signaling and reduced rates of cell migration to avoid tumor 
microenvironments. On the other end of the size spectrum, large animals such as 
elephants and whales also appear to have low overall cancer rates, possibly due 
to gene replicates that are involved in apoptosis and therefore can inhibit 
uncontrolled cell cycle progression. While it is important to determine the 
mechanisms that lead to cancer protection in these animals, we can also take 
advantage of other animals that are highly susceptible to cancer, especially 
those which develop tumors similar to humans, such as carnivores or poultry. The 
use of such animals does not require the transplantation of malignant cancer 
cells or use of oncogenic substances as they spontaneously develop tumors of 
similar presentation and pathophysiology to those found in humans. For example, 
some tumor suppressor genes are highly conserved between humans and domestic 
species, and various tumors develop in similar ways or because of a common 
environment. These animals are therefore of great interest for broadening 
perspectives and techniques and for gathering information on the tumor 
mechanisms of certain types of cancer. Here we present a detailed review of 
alternative and/or non-model vertebrates, that can be used at different levels 
of cancer research to open new perspectives and fields of action."
2286,"Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a ubiquitous virus replicating in human 
dermal fibroblasts. MCPyV DNA can be detected on healthy skin in 67-90% of 
various body sites, and intact virions are regularly shed from the skin. 
Infection occurs early in life, and seropositivity increases from 37 to 42% in 
1- to 6-year-olds to 92% in adults. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but 
very aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin. It develops mainly on 
sun-exposed areas as a fast-growing, reddish nodule. Two MCC entities exist: 
about 80% of MCC are MCPyV-associated. Tumorigenesis is driven by viral 
integration into the host genome and MCPyV oncogene expression. In 
MCPyV-negative MCC, UV radiation causes extensive DNA damage leading to the 
deregulation of the cell cycle. In recent decades, MCC incidence rates have 
increased worldwide, e.g., in the United States, from 0.15 in 1986 to 
0.7/100,000 in 2016. Risk factors for the development of MCC include male sex, 
older age (&gt;75 years), fair skin, intense UV exposure, and immunosuppression. 
Projections suggest that due to aging populations, an increase in 
immunosuppressed patients, and enhanced UV exposure, MCC incidence rates will 
continue to rise. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are crucial to reducing 
high MCC morbidity and mortality."
2287,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this work was to analyze the interplay between age and 
viral status on the outcomes in loco-regionally advanced oropharyngeal and 
nasopharyngeal cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and different 
chemotherapy combinations.
METHODS: A retrospective (2006-2017) analysis was performed on non-metastatic 
loco-regionally advanced oropharyngeal (both HPV+ and HPV-) and EBV+ 
nasopharyngeal cancer patients (young: &lt;65 years vs. elderly: ≥65 years) 
treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The impact of age and 
viral status on overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were studied with 
multivariable models, which were adjusted for smoking, stage, comorbidities, 
chemotherapy dose intensity and treatment strategy.
RESULTS: We analyzed 324 patients (146 HPV+ oropharynx, 63 HPV-, 115 
nasopharynx). Elderly patients had more comorbidities, and received less 
intensive treatments when compared to younger subjects. Although OS and DFS were 
shorter in older patients, after adjustment for stage, smoking, comorbidities, 
treatment strategy and dose intensity, no significant differences in terms of 
survival were observed according to age (65 vs. 50 years of age: HR 1.89, 95% CI 
0.45-7.84 for HPV+ OPC; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.29-2.89 for HPV- OPC; HR 1.99, 95% CI 
0.9-4.39 for NPC; p = 0.395).
CONCLUSIONS: Several potential age-related (comorbidities, treatment intensity) 
and disease-related (stage) confounding factors play a prognostic role with 
differential impacts on both virus and non-virus-related tumors. In HPV+ 
oropharyngeal cancer and in EBV+ nasopharyngeal cancer patients, age should be 
considered as the expression of an array of host- and tumor-related features 
rather than an independent prognostic factor."
2288,"Morphological, transcriptomic, and genomic defects are well-explored parameters 
of cancer biology. In more recent years, the impact of epigenetic influences, 
such as DNA methylation, is becoming more appreciated. Aberrant DNA methylation 
has been implicated in many types of cancers, influencing cell type, state, 
transcriptional regulation, and genomic stability to name a few. Traditionally, 
large populations of cells from the tissue of interest are coalesced for 
analysis, producing averaged methylome data. Considering the inherent 
heterogeneity of cancer, analysing populations of cells as a whole denies the 
ability to discover novel aberrant methylation patterns, identify 
subpopulations, and trace cell lineages. Due to recent advancements in 
technology, it is now possible to obtain methylome data from single cells. This 
has both research and clinical implications, ranging from the identification of 
biomarkers to improved diagnostic tools. As with all emerging technologies, 
distinct experimental, bioinformatic, and practical challenges present 
themselves. This review begins with exploring the potential impact of 
single-cell sequencing on understanding cancer biology and how it could 
eventually benefit a clinical setting. Following this, the techniques and 
experimental approaches which made this technology possible are explored. 
Finally, the present challenges currently associated with single-cell DNA 
methylation sequencing are described."
2289,"BACKGROUND: The applicability of UICC TNM staging for gastric cancer (GC) 
patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCTX) and surgery was not yet 
analyzed in comparison to patients undergoing primary surgery (PS). The purpose 
of this analysis was to analyze if the prognostic impact of TNM staging after 
nCTx is comparable with PS.
METHODS: Data for patients having been treated for GC with or without nCTx 
between 1990 and 2016 were analyzed. Uni-(URA) and multivariable regression 
analyses (MRA) were performed to identify predictors. Survival according to the 
UICC 8th edition stages was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and cox 
regression analysis. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance 
for confounders.
RESULTS: 1149 patients with GC were eligible for primary analysis. URA 
demonstrated age (p &lt; 0.0001), tumor localization (p &lt; 0.0001), clinical 
UICC-stage, complications, UICC stage 0, IIB-IIIC, Lauren subtype, grading, and 
R-stage to be significantly associated with OS. MRA revealed that age, distal 
tumor localization, more than 25 dissected lymph nodes, UICC stage 0, IIB-IIIC, 
and Lauren subtype were significantly and independently related to OS. After 
PSM, survival analyses revealed only a significant difference for pN2/ypN2 (p = 
0.03), while all other T and N stages were comparable.
CONCLUSION: UICC dependent survival stages do not change significantly after 
nCTx treatment for GC. Therefore, UICC staging in its present version is 
applicable to patients undergoing nCTx."
2290,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare, but aggressive, carcinoma derived 
from follicular cells. While conventional treatments may improve patients' 
survival, the lethality remains high. Therefore, there is an urgent need for 
more effective ATC treatments. Cardiotonic steroids, such as ouabain, have been 
shown to have therapeutic potential in cancer treatment. Thus, we aimed to 
evaluate ouabain's effects in human anaplastic thyroid cells. For this, 8505C 
cells were cultured in the presence or absence of ouabain. Viability, cell 
death, cell cycle, colony formation and migratory ability were evaluated in 
ouabain-treated and control 8505C cells. The expression of differentiation and 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, as well as IL-6, TGFb1 and 
their respective receptors were also quantified in these same cells. Our results 
showed that ouabain in vitro decreased the number of viable 8505C cells, 
possibly due to an inhibition of proliferation. A reduction in migration was 
also observed in ouabain-treated 8505C cells. In contrast, decreased mRNA levels 
of PAX8 and TTF1 differentiation markers and increased levels of the N-cadherin 
EMT marker, as well as IL-6 and TGFb1, were found in ouabain-treated 8505C 
cells. In short, ouabain may have anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effect 
on 8505C cells, but maintains an aggressive and undifferentiated profile."
2291,"Due to the aberrant hypervascularization and the high immune infiltration of 
renal tumours, current therapeutic regimens of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) target 
angiogenic or immunosuppressive pathways or both. Tumour angiogenesis plays an 
essential role in tumour growth and immunosuppression. Indeed, the aberrant 
vasculature promotes hypoxia and can also exert immunosuppressive functions. In 
addition, pro-angiogenic factors, including VEGF-A, have an immunosuppressive 
action on immune cells. Despite the progress of treatments in RCC, there are 
still non responders or acquired resistance. Currently, no biomarkers are used 
in clinical practice to guide the choice between the different available 
treatments. Considering the role of angiogenesis in RCC, angiogenesis-related 
markers are interesting candidates. They have been studied in the response to 
antiangiogenic drugs (AA) and show interest in predicting the response. They 
have been less studied in immunotherapy alone or combined with AA. In this 
review, we will discuss the role of angiogenesis in tumour growth and immune 
escape and the place of angiogenesis-targeted biomarkers to predict response to 
current therapies in RCC."
2292,"(1) Background: CD163, a specific macrophage receptor, affects the progression 
of malignant tumors. Unfortunately, the regulation and expression of CD163 are 
poorly understood. In this study, we determined the expressions of CD163 in TMA 
samples from CRC patients and combined them with patient data from several 
Swedish hospitals. (2) Methods: The expressions of CD163 in tissue samples from 
CRC patients were examined. After combining 472 CRC patients' gene expression 
and 438 CRC patients' clinical data with the TCGA database, 964 cases from the 
GEO database, and experimental expression data from 1247 Swedish CRC patients, 
we selected four genes (PCNA, LOX, BCL2, and CD163) and analyzed the 
tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) and CRC prognosis. (3) Results: Based on 
histopathological TMA analysis, CD163 was strongly expressed in the stroma of 
both normal and cancer tissues, and the expressions in normal and cancer cells 
varied from negative to strong. The results from public databases show decreased 
expression of CD163 in cancer tissue compared to normal mucosa (|log FC| &gt; 1 
and FDR &lt; 0.01), and it is a negative prognostic factor for CRC patients 
(p-value &lt; 0.05). Through tumor microenvironment (TME) analysis, we found a 
potential influence of CD163 on immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, the 
enrichment analysis indicated the possible interaction with other proteins and 
biological pathways. (4) Conclusions: CD163 is expressed differently in CRC 
tissue and is a negative prognostic factor. Its expression is associated with 
the TME and tumor purity of CRC. Considering all results, CD163 has the 
potential to be a predictive biomarker in the investigation of CRC."
2293,"Prostate cancer is very frequent and is, in many countries, the third-leading 
cause of cancer related death in men. While early diagnosis and treatment by 
surgical removal is often curative, metastasizing prostate cancer has a very bad 
prognosis. Based on the androgen-dependence of prostate epithelial cells, the 
standard treatment is blockade of the androgen receptor (AR). However, nearly 
all patients suffer from a tumor relapse as the metastasizing cells become 
AR-independent. In our study we show a counter-regulatory link between AR and 
NF-κB both in human cells and in mouse models of prostate cancer, implying that 
inhibition of AR signaling results in induction of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory 
pathways, which may even foster the survival of metastasizing cells. This could 
be shown by reporter gene assays, DNA-binding measurements, and 
immune-fluorescence microscopy, and furthermore by a whole set of computational 
methods using a variety of datasets. Interestingly, loss of PTEN, a frequent 
genetic alteration in prostate cancer, also causes an upregulation of NF-κB and 
inflammatory activity. Finally, we present a mathematical model of a dynamic 
network between AR, NF-κB/IκB, PI3K/PTEN, and the oncogene c-Myc, which 
indicates that AR blockade may upregulate c-Myc together with NF-κB, and that 
combined anti-AR/anti-NF-κB and anti-PI3K treatment might be beneficial."
2294,"Advances in cancer screening and early detection, as well as improvements in 
surgical techniques and therapeutics, have contributed to decreasing gastric 
cancer mortality. The number of gastric cancer survivors continues to rise; 
however, long-term follow-up has revealed an increase in the risk of 
post-gastrectomy symptoms or other health problems, such as extra-gastric 
secondary primary cancer (SPC), in these survivors. Therefore, evidence-based 
screening for new primary cancer is needed in these populations; however, the 
incidence of SPC varies by country or continent and its characteristics have not 
been clearly reported. The characteristics of SPC are of increasing interest to 
both treatment providers and gastric cancer survivors; thus, this literature 
review explores not only the epidemiology and biology of SPC but also clinical 
and biological factors that influence its prognosis."
