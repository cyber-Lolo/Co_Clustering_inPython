0,"BACKGROUND: Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystemic complex genetic 
disorder caused by the loss of paternally expressed genes in the human 
chromosome region 15q11.2-q13. It is characterized by severe hypotonia and 
feeding difficulties in early infancy, followed in later infancy or early 
childhood by excessive eating and gradual development of morbid obesity. Motor 
milestones and language development are delayed and most patients have 
intellectual disability.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we describe a rare PWS case caused by mosaic imprinting 
defect in the region 15q11.2-q13 of paternal origin. The proband was a male 
child with a clinical presentation of global developmental delay and hypotonia 
with specific facial features. Karyotype of the child was noted as mosaic: 
45XY,der(15)?t(15;21),-21[26]/46,XY[24]. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified 
a deletion of 22.7 Mb in size at chr15q11.2q21.1 region and a deletion of 2.1 Mb 
in size at chr21q22.3 region. The Methylation-specific multiplex 
ligation-dependent probe amplification(MS-MLPA) of the 15q11.2-q13 region showed 
that the loading ratio of methylated alleles was 70% and that of unmethylated 
alleles was 30%(50% normal), which confirmed that the loss of mosaic imprinted 
defects in the paternal allele led to the diagnosis of PWS.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that complete clinical criteria for PWS should not be 
considered sensitive in diagnosing partial atypical PWS due to mosaic imprinting 
defects. In contrast, clinical suspicion based on less restrictive criteria 
followed by multiple techniques is a more powerful approach."
1,"BACKGROUND: Recently genome-based studies revealed that the abnormality of Hippo 
signaling is pervasive in TNBC and played important role in cancer progression. 
RING finger protein 31 (RNF31) comes to RING family E3 ubiquitin ligase. Our 
previously published studies have revealed RNF31 is elevated in ER positive 
breast cancer via activating estrogen signaling and suppressing P53 pathway.
METHODS: We used several TNBC cell lines and xenograft models and performed 
immuno-blots, QPCR, in vivo studies to investigate the function of RNF31 in TNBC 
progression.
RESULT: Here, we demonstrate that RNF31 plays tumor suppressive function in 
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). RNF31 depletion increased TNBC cell 
proliferation and migration in vitro and in vitro. RNF31 depletion in TNBC 
coupled with global genomic expression profiling indicated Hippo signaling could 
be the potential target for RNF31 to exert its function. Further data showed 
that RNF31 depletion could increase the level of YAP protein, and Hippo 
signaling target genes expression in several TNBC cell lines, while clinical 
data illustrated that RNF31 expression correlated with longer relapse-free 
survival in TNBC patients and reversely correlated with YAP protein level. The 
molecular biology assays implicated that RNF31 could associate with YAP protein, 
facilitate YAP poly-ubiquitination and degradation at YAP K76 sites. 
Interestingly, RNF31 could also repress PDL1 expression and sensitive TNBC 
immunotherapy via inhibiting Hippo/YAP/PDL1 axis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the multi-faced function of RNF31 in different 
subtypes of breast malignancies, while activation RNF31 could be a plausible 
strategy for TNBC therapeutics."
2,"BACKGROUND: Poly γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) is a promising biopolymer for various 
applications. For glutamic acid-independent strains, the titer of γ-PGA is too 
low to meet the industrial demand. In this study, we isolated a novel 
γ-PGA-producing strain, Bacillus tequilensis BL01, and multiple genetic 
engineering strategies were implemented to improve γ-PGA production.
RESULTS: First, the one-factor-at-a-time method was used to investigate the 
influence of carbon and nitrogen sources and temperature on γ-PGA production. 
The optimal sources of carbon and nitrogen were sucrose and (NH4)2SO4 at 37 °C, 
respectively. Second, the sucA, gudB, pgdS, and ggt genes were knocked out 
simultaneously, which increased the titer of γ-PGA by 1.75 times. Then, the 
titer of γ-PGA increased to 18.0 ± 0.3 g/L by co-overexpression of the citZ and 
pyk genes in the mutant strain. Furthermore, the γ-PGA titer reached 
25.3 ± 0.8 g/L with a productivity of 0.84 g/L/h and a yield of 1.50 g of 
γ-PGA/g of citric acid in fed-batch fermentation. It should be noted that this 
study enables the synthesis of low (1.84 × 105 Da) and high (2.06 × 106 Da) 
molecular weight of γ-PGA by BL01 and the engineering strain.
CONCLUSION: The application of recently published strategies to successfully 
improve γ-PGA production for the new strain B. tequilensis BL01 is reported. The 
titer of γ-PGA increased 2.17-fold and 1.32-fold compared with that of the wild 
type strain in the flask and 5 L fermenter. The strain shows excellent promise 
as a γ-PGA producer compared with previous studies. Meanwhile, different 
molecular weights of γ-PGA were obtained, enhancing the scope of application in 
industry."
3,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a gynaecological endocrine disease. The 
objective of the present study was to investigate the role of GTPase 
immunity-associated protein (GIMAP) 7 in PCOS. A PCOS rat model was established 
using dehydroepiandrosterone injection. The data showed that GIMAP7 was mainly 
located in granulosa cells and was abundantly expressed in the ovarian granulosa 
cells of PCOS rats. GIMAP7 silencing decreased blood glucose levels, HOMA-IR 
scores, and number of cystic follicles. In addition, GIMAP7 silencing corrected 
erratic oestrous cycles, inhibited apoptosis and reduced c-caspase-3 protein 
expression in the ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. GIMAP7 silencing reduced 
malondialdehyde (MDA) but increased glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase 
(SOD) levels in the serum and ovarian tissues of PCOS rats. The effects of 
GIMAP7 were further investigated in human ovarian granulosa KGN cells. GIMAP7 
silencing increased the viability, promoted proliferation, and increased the 
percentage of S-phase KGN cells. The apoptosis rate was significantly decreased 
by GIMAP7 silencing. GIMAP7 also inhibited oxidative stress in KGN cells, 
resulting in decreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and MDA and 
increased levels of GSH and SOD. Notably, GIMAP7 inhibited the sonic hedgehog 
(SHH) signalling pathway, and GIMAP7 silencing increased the expression of the 
SHH signalling pathway downstream genes SHH, SMO, and Gli1. Inhibition of the 
SHH signalling pathway using cyclopamine reduced the effect of GIMAP7 silencing 
on KGN cells. This study proved that GIMAP7 promotes oxidative stress and 
apoptosis in ovarian granulosa cells in PCOS by inhibiting the SHH signalling 
pathway."
4,"BACKGROUND: After many years of neglect in the field of alternative splicing, 
the importance of intron retention (IR) in cancer has come into focus following 
landmark discoveries of aberrant IR patterns in cancer. Many solid and liquid 
tumours are associated with drastic increases in IR, and such patterns have been 
pursued as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Paradoxically, breast cancer 
(BrCa) is the only tumour type in which IR is reduced compared to adjacent 
normal breast tissue.
METHODS: In this study, we have conducted a pan-cancer analysis of IR with 
emphasis on BrCa and its subtypes. We explored mechanisms that could cause 
aberrant and pathological IR and clarified why normal breast tissue has 
unusually high IR.
RESULTS: Strikingly, we found that aberrantly decreasing IR in BrCa can be 
largely attributed to normal breast tissue having the highest occurrence of IR 
events compared to other healthy tissues. Our analyses suggest that low numbers 
of IR events in breast tumours are associated with poor prognosis, particularly 
in the luminal B subtype. Interestingly, we found that IR frequencies negatively 
correlate with cell proliferation in BrCa cells, i.e. rapidly dividing tumour 
cells have the lowest number of IR events. Aberrant RNA-binding protein 
expression and changes in tissue composition are among the causes of aberrantly 
decreasing IR in BrCa.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that IR should be considered for therapeutic 
manipulation in BrCa patients with aberrantly low IR levels and that further 
work is needed to understand the cause and impact of high IR in other tumour 
types."
5,"RATIONALE: Recent research has indicated that cuprotosis, or copper induced cell 
death, is a novel type of cell death that could be utilized as a new weapon for 
cancer management. However, the characteristics and implications of such 
signatures in cancers, especially in clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC), 
remain elusive.
METHODS: Expression, methylation, mutation, clinical information, copy number 
variation, functional implication, and drug sensitivity data at the pan-cancer 
level were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas. An unsupervised clustering 
algorithm was applied to decipher ccRCC heterogeneity. Immune microenvironment 
construction, immune therapy response, metabolic pattern, and cancer progression 
signature between subgroups were also investigated.
RESULTS: Cuprotosis related genes were specifically downregulated in various 
cancer tissues compared with normal tissues and were correlated with 
hypermethylation and copy number variation. Cuprotosis scores were also 
dysregulated in tumor tissues, and we found that such a signature could 
positively regulate oxidative phosphorylation and Myc and negatively regulate 
epithelial mesenchymal translation and myogenesis pathways. CPCS1 (cuprotosis 
scores high) and CPCS2 (cuprotosis scores low) in ccRCC displayed distinctive 
clinical profiles and biological characteristics; the CPCS2 subtype had a higher 
clinical stage and a worse prognosis and might positively regulate cornification 
and epidermal cell differentiation to fuel cancer progression. CPCS2 also 
displayed a higher tumor mutation burden and low tumor stemness index, while it 
led to a low ICI therapy response and dysfunctional tumor immunity state. The 
genome-copy numbers of CPCS2, including arm- gain and arm- loss, were higher 
than those of CPCS1. The prognostic model constructed based on subgroup 
biomarkers exerted satisfactory performance in both the training and validation 
cohorts. In addition, overexpression of the copper death activator DLAT 
suppressed the malignant ability, including cell migration and proliferation, of 
renal cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Finally, activation of cuprotosis in 
tumors could enhance antitumor immunity through dsDNA-cGAS-STING signaling in 
ccRCC.
CONCLUSION: The activation of cuprotosis might function as a promising approach 
among multiple cancers. The cuprotosis related signatures could reshape tumor 
immunity in the ccRCC microenvironment via cGAS-STING signal, thus activating 
tumor antigen-presenting process. Upregulation of DLAT expression in ccRCC cell 
lines could reactivate the copper death pattern and be treated as a suitable 
target for ccRCC."
6,"Anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), daratumumab, and isatuximab have 
represented a breakthrough in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Recently, 
CD38-based mAbs were expected to achieve increasing potential beyond MM, which 
encouraged us to develop new anti-CD38 mAbs to meet clinical needs. In this 
study, we developed a novel humanized anti-CD38 antibody, FTL004, which 
exhibited enhanced pro-apoptotic ability and negligible binding to red blood 
cells (RBCs). FTL004 presented a better ability to induce direct apoptosis 
independent of Fc-mediated cross-linking against lymphoma and MM cell lines as 
well as primary myeloma cells derived from MM patients. For instance, FTL004 
induced RPMI 8226 cells with 55% early apoptosis cells compared with 20% in the 
isatuximab-treated group. Of interest, FTL004 showed ignorable binding to CD38 
on human RBCs in contrast to tumor cells, even at concentrations up to 30 μg/mL. 
Furthermore, with an engineered Fc domain, FTL004 displayed stronger 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against CD38+ malignant cells. 
In vivo MM and non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumor xenograft models showed that FTL004 
possessed an effective anti-tumor effect. Cryo-electron microscopy structure 
resolved two epitope centers of FTL004 on CD38: one of which was unique while 
the other partly overlapped with that of isatuximab. Taken together, FTL004 
distinguishes it from other CD38 targeting mAbs and represents a potential 
candidate for the treatment of MM and non-Hodgkin lymphoma."
7,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is a highly malignant and heterogeneous tumor 
which is currently the cancer with the highest incidence and seriously endangers 
the survival and prognosis of patients. Aging, as a research hotspot in recent 
years, is widely considered to be involved in the occurrence and development of 
a variety of tumors. However, the relationship between aging-related genes 
(ARGs) and BC has not yet been fully elucidated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression profiles and clinicopathological data were 
acquired in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the gene expression omnibus (GEO) 
database. Firstly, the differentially expressed ARGs in BC and normal breast 
tissues were investigated. Based on these differential genes, a risk model was 
constructed composed of 11 ARGs via univariate and multivariate Cox analysis. 
Subsequently, survival analysis, independent prognostic analysis, time-dependent 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and nomogram were performed to 
assess its ability to sensitively and specifically predict the survival and 
prognosis of patients, which was also verified in the validation set. In 
addition, functional enrichment analysis and immune infiltration analysis were 
applied to reveal the relationship between the risk scores and tumor immune 
microenvironment, immune status and immunotherapy. Finally, multiple datasets 
and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were utilized to verify the 
expression level of the key genes.
RESULTS: An 11-gene signature (including FABP7, IGHD, SPIB, CTSW, IGKC, SEZ6, 
S100B, CXCL1, IGLV6-57, CPLX2 and CCL19) was established to predict the survival 
of BC patients, which was validated by the GEO cohort. Based on the risk model, 
the BC patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups, and the high-risk 
patients showed worse survival. Stepwise ROC analysis and Cox analyses 
demonstrated the good performance and independence of the model. Moreover, a 
nomogram combined with the risk score and clinical parameters was built for 
prognostic prediction. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the robust 
relationship between the risk model with immune-related functions and pathways. 
Subsequent immune microenvironment analysis, immunotherapy, etc., indicated that 
the immune status of patients in the high-risk group decreased, and the 
anti-tumor immune function was impaired, which was significantly different with 
those in the low-risk group. Eventually, the expression level of FABP7, IGHD, 
SPIB, CTSW, IGKC, SEZ6, S100B, CXCL1, IGLV6-57 and CCL19 was identified as 
down-regulated in tumor cell line, while CPLX2 up-regulated, which was mostly 
similar with the results in TCGA and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) via RT-PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study constructed a risk model composed of ARGs, 
which could be used as a solid model for predicting the survival and prognosis 
of BC patients. Moreover, this model also played an important role in tumor 
immunity, providing a new direction for patient immune status assessment and 
immunotherapy selection."
8,"BACKGROUND: As an attractive platform chemical, malic acid has been commonly 
used in the food, feed and pharmaceutical field. Microbial fermentation of 
biobased sources to produce malic acid has attracted great attention because it 
is sustainable and environment-friendly. However, most studies mainly focus on 
improving yield and ignore shortening fermentation time. A long fermentation 
period means high cost, and hinders the industrial applications of microbial 
fermentation. Stresses, especially oxidative stress generated during 
fermentation, inhibit microbial growth and production, and prolong fermentation 
period. Previous studies have shown that polypeptides could effectively relieve 
stresses, but the underlying mechanisms were poorly understood.
RESULTS: In this study, polypeptides (especially elastin peptide) addition 
improves the productivity of malic acid in A. niger, resulting in shortening of 
fermentation time from 120 to 108 h. Transcriptome and biochemical analyses 
demonstrated that both antioxidant enzyme-mediated oxidative stress defense 
system, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione 
peroxidase (GPX), and nonenzymatic antioxidant system, such as glutathione, were 
enhanced in the presence of elastin peptide, suggesting elastin peptide 
relieving oxidative stresses is involved in many pathways. In order to further 
investigate the relationship between oxidative stress defense and malic acid 
productivity, we overexpressed three enzymes (Sod1, CAT, Tps1) related to 
oxidation resistance in A. niger, respectively, and these resulting strains 
display varying degree of improvement in malic acid productivity. Especially, 
the strain overexpressing the Sod1 gene achieved a malate titer of 
91.85 ± 2.58 g/L in 96 h, corresponding to a productivity of 0.96 g/L/h, which 
performs better than elastin peptide addition.
CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation provides an excellent reference for alleviating 
the stress of the fungal fermentation process and improving fermentation 
efficiency."
9,"BACKGROUND: Osteopathia Striata with Cranial Sclerosis (OS-CS), also known as 
Horan-Beighton Syndrome, is a rare genetic disease; about 90 cases have been 
reported to date. It is associated with mutations (heterozygous for female 
subjects and hemizygous for males) of the AMER1 gene, located at Xq11.2, and 
shows an X-linked pattern of transmission. Typical clinical manifestations 
include macrocephaly, characteristic facial features (frontal bossing, 
epicanthal folds, hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge, orofacial cleft, 
prominent jaw), hearing loss and developmental delay. Males usually present a 
more severe phenotype than females and rarely survive. Diagnostic suspicion is 
based on clinical signs, radiographic findings of cranial and long bones 
sclerosis and metaphyseal striations, subsequent genetic testing may confirm it.
CASE PRESENTATION: Hereby, we report on a female newborn with frontal and 
parietal bossing, narrow bitemporal diameter, dysplastic, 
low-set and posteriorly rotated ears, microretrognathia, cleft palate, and 
rhizomelic shortening of lower limbs. Postnatally, she manifested feeding 
intolerance with biliary vomiting and abdominal distension. Therefore, in the 
suspicion of bowel obstruction, she underwent surgery, which evidenced and 
corrected an intestinal malrotation. Limbs X-ray and skull computed tomography 
investigations did not show cranial sclerosis and/or metaphyseal striations. 
Array-CGH analysis revealed normal findings. Then, a target next generation 
sequencing (NGS) analysis, including the genes involved in skeletal dysplasias, 
was performed and revealed a de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation of the AMER1 
gene. The patient was discharged at 2 months of age and included in a 
multidisciplinary follow-up. Aged 9 months, she now shows developmental and 
growth (except for relative macrocephaly) delay. The surgical correction of 
cleft palate has been planned.
CONCLUSIONS: Our report shows the uncommon association of intestinal malrotation 
in a female newborn with OS-CS. It highlights that neonatologists have to 
consider such a diagnosis, even in absence of cranial sclerosis and long bones 
striations, as these usually appear over time. Other syndromes with cranial 
malformations and skeletal dysplasia must be included in the differential 
diagnosis. The phenotypic spectrum is wide and variable in both genders. Due to 
variable X-inactivation, females may also show a severe and early-onset clinical 
picture. Multidisciplinary management and careful, early and long-term follow-up 
should be offered to these patients, in order to promptly identify any 
associated morbidities and prevent possible complications or adverse outcomes."
10,"INTRODUCTION: Lipid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress play an 
important role in the progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC). We aimed to establish lipid droplet (LD)-associated and ER stress-related 
gene risk signature as prognostic indicators.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature searches for LD-associated proteins was 
screened and validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International 
Cancer Genome Collaboratory (ICGC) databases. A total of 371 samples were 
enrolled from the TCGA RNA-seq dataset (training cohort) and 240 samples from 
IGGC RNA-seq dataset (validation cohort). A 10-gene risk signature was 
established by the last absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
regression analysis. The prognostic value of the risk signature was evaluated by 
Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier and ROC Curve analyses. Biological features 
associated with LD and ER stress-related factors were explored by functional 
analysis and in vitro experiment.
RESULTS: Based on the medical literatures, 124 lipid droplet-associated proteins 
were retrieved, and three genes failed to establish a valid prognostic model. ER 
stress was considered as an important component by functional analysis. A 
10-gene risk signature compared the clinicopathology characteristics, 
immunosuppressive events and a nomogram in HCC patients.
CONCLUSION: LD-associated and ER stress-related gene risk signatures highlighted 
poor prognosis for clinicopathological features, positively correlate with 
macrophages and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-3 (TIM-3) expression in the 
tumor microenvironment, and might act as independent prognostic factors."
11,"BACKGROUND: The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is an area of 
interest for researchers due to its eco-friendly approach. The use of biological 
approaches provides a clean and promising alternative process for the synthesis 
of AgNPs. We used for the first time the supernatant of Leclercia adecarboxylata 
THHM under optimal conditions to produce AgNPs with an acceptable antimicrobial 
activity against important clinical pathogens.
RESULTS: In this study, soil bacteria from different locations were isolated and 
screened for their potential to form AgNPs. The selected isolate, which was 
found to have the ability to biosynthesize AgNPs, was identified by molecular 
methods as Leclercia adecarboxylata THHM and its 16S rRNA gene was deposited in 
GenBank under the accession number OK605882. Different conditions were screened 
for the maximum production of AgNPs by the selected bacteria. Five independent 
variables were investigated through optimizations using one variable at a time 
(OVAT) and the Plackett-Burman experimental design (PBD). The overall optimal 
parameters for enhancing the biosynthesis of AgNPs using the supernatant of 
Leclercia adecarboxylata THHM as a novel organism were at an incubation time of 
72.0 h, a concentration of 1.5 mM silver nitrate, a temperature of 40.0 °C, a pH 
of 7.0, and a supernatant concentration of 30% (v/v) under illumination 
conditions. The biosynthesized AgNPs have been characterized by UV-visible 
spectroscopy (UV-Vis), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier 
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The biosynthesized AgNPs showed an 
absorption peak at 423 nm, spherical shape, and an average particle size of 
17.43 nm. FTIR shows the bands at 3321.50, 2160.15, and 1636.33 cm-1 
corresponding to the binding vibrations of amine, alkyne nitrile, and primary 
amine bands, respectively. The biosynthesized AgNPs showed antimicrobial 
activity against a variety of microbial pathogens of medical importance. Using 
resazurin-based microtiter dilution, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
values for AgNPs were 500 µg/mL for all microbial pathogens except for 
Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC13883, which has a higher MIC value of 1000 µg/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data revealed the successful green production of AgNPs 
using the supernatant of Leclercia adecarboxylata THHM that can be effectively 
used as an antimicrobial agent against most human pathogenic microbes."
12,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) affects embryonic development, 
causing a variable fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotype with 
neuronal disorders and birth defects. We hypothesize that early alcohol-induced 
epigenetic changes disrupt the accurate developmental programming of embryo and 
consequently cause the complex phenotype of developmental disorders. To explore 
the etiology of FASD, we collected unique biological samples of 80 severely 
alcohol-exposed and 100 control newborns at birth.
METHODS: We performed genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) and gene expression 
analyses of placentas by using microarrays (EPIC, Illumina) and mRNA sequencing, 
respectively. To test the manifestation of observed PAE-associated DNAm changes 
in embryonic tissues as well as potential biomarkers for PAE, we examined if the 
changes can be detected also in white blood cells or buccal epithelial cells of 
the same newborns by EpiTYPER. To explore the early effects of alcohol on 
extraembryonic placental tissue, we selected 27 newborns whose mothers had 
consumed alcohol up to gestational week 7 at maximum to the separate analyses. 
Furthermore, to explore the effects of early alcohol exposure on embryonic 
cells, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as well as hESCs during 
differentiation into endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal cells were exposed 
to alcohol in vitro.
RESULTS: DPPA4, FOXP2, and TACR3 with significantly decreased DNAm were 
discovered-particularly the regulatory region of DPPA4 in the early 
alcohol-exposed placentas. When hESCs were exposed to alcohol in vitro, 
significantly altered regulation of DPPA2, a closely linked heterodimer of 
DPPA4, was observed. While the regulatory region of DPPA4 was unmethylated in 
both control and alcohol-exposed hESCs, alcohol-induced decreased DNAm similar 
to placenta was seen in in vitro differentiated mesodermal and ectodermal cells. 
Furthermore, common genes with alcohol-associated DNAm changes in placenta and 
hESCs were linked exclusively to the neurodevelopmental pathways in the 
enrichment analysis, which emphasizes the value of placental tissue when 
analyzing the effects of prenatal environment on human development.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows the effects of early alcohol exposure on human 
embryonic and extraembryonic cells, introduces candidate genes for 
alcohol-induced developmental disorders, and reveals potential biomarkers for 
prenatal alcohol exposure."
13,"BACKGROUND: Randall's plaques (RP) are identified as anchored sites for kidney 
calcium oxalate stones, but the mechanism remains unclear. Given the importance 
of osteogenic-like cells in RP formation and OCT4 in reprogramming 
differentiated cells to osteoblasts, the current study explored the potential 
role of OCT4 in RP formation.
METHODS: OCT4 and biomineralization were evaluated in RP, and immunofluorescence 
co-staining was performed to identify these cells with alteration of OCT4 and 
osteogenic markers. Based on the analysis of tissue, we further investigated the 
mechanism of OCT4 in regulating osteogenic-like differentiation of primary human 
renal interstitial fibroblasts (hRIFs) in vitro and vivo.
RESULTS: We identified the upregulated OCT4 in RP, with a positive correlation 
to osteogenic markers. Interestingly, fibroblast marker Vimentin was partially 
co-localized with upregulated OCT4 and osteogenic markers in RP. Further 
investigations revealed that OCT4 significantly enhanced the osteogenic-like 
phenotype of hRIFs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, OCT4 directly bound to 
BMP2 promoter and facilitated its CpG island demethylation to transcriptionally 
promote BMP2 expression. Furthermore, combination of RIP and RNA profiling 
uncovered that lncRNA OLMALINC physically interacted with OCT4 to promote its 
stabilization via disrupting the ubiquitination. Additionally, OLMALINC was 
upregulated in fibroblasts in RP visualized by FISH, and a positive correlation 
was revealed between OLMALINC and OCT4 in RP.
CONCLUSIONS: The upregulation of OCT4 in hRIFs was a pathological feature of RP 
formation, and OLMALINC/OCT4/BMP2 axis facilitated hRIFs to acquire 
osteogenic-like phenotype under osteogenic conditions, through which the pathway 
might participate in RP formation. Our findings opened up a new avenue to better 
understand RP formation in which osteogenic-like process was partially triggered 
by lncRNAs and pluripotency maintenance related genes."
14,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is associated with 
remodeling of gut microbiota. Many studies have found H. pylori infection and 
eradication therapy can alter the gut microbiota. However, few studies explored 
the impact of eradication therapy containing minocycline and metronidazole on 
gut microbiota.
AIM: The objective of the present study was to explore the changes of gut 
microbiota after H. pylori infection. Besides, learn more about the dynamic 
changes of gut microbiota during different stages of eradication treatment 
containing minocycline, metronidazole, bismuth agents and proton pump 
inhibitors.
METHODS: Sixty stool samples from the patients with H. pylori infection before 
eradication, 14 and 42 days after eradication, and ten stool samples from 
non-infected individuals were collected. Subsequently, we performed 16S rRNA 
gene amplicon sequencing to analyze these samples, and the results were 
evaluated by using alpha diversity, beta diversity and microbial composition 
analyses. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of 
Unobserved States was also used to predict the metabolic pathways according to 
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database.
RESULTS: The alpha and beta diversity of the microbiota changed significantly in 
H. pylori infected individuals, but returned to baseline 42 days after 
eradication therapy. At the genus level, the abundances of Bacteroidetes, 
[Ruminococcus]_gnavus_group, Ruminococcaceae_Incertae_Sedis, Tuzzrealla, 
Butyricicoccus were significantly lower in the H. pylori infected group. 
Bacterial abundance was also dynamically changing during eradication treatment. 
In addition, PICRUST analysis found the levels of uronic acid metabolism, 
uncharacterized transport system, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids 
were higher in H. pylori infected individuals than in the non-infected group.
CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal microbiota diversity, composition, functional 
predictions altered significantly after H. pylori infection, and gradually 
returned to healthy control levels after the application of eradication therapy 
containing minocycline and metronidazole in one month and a half."
15,"BACKGROUND: Publicly available RNA-seq datasets are often underused although 
being helpful to improve functional annotation of eukaryotic genomes. This is 
especially true for filamentous fungi genomes which structure differs from most 
well annotated yeast genomes. Podospora anserina is a filamentous fungal model, 
which genome has been sequenced and annotated in 2008. Still, the current 
annotation lacks information about cis-regulatory elements, including promoters, 
transcription starting sites and terminators, which are instrumental to 
integrate epigenomic features into global gene regulation strategies.
RESULTS: Here we took advantage of 37 RNA-seq experiments that were obtained in 
contrasted developmental and physiological conditions, to complete the 
functional annotation of P. anserina genome. Out of the 10,800 previously 
annotated genes, 5'UTR and 3'UTR were defined for 7554, among which, 3328 showed 
differential transcriptional signal starts and/or transcriptional end sites. In 
addition, alternative splicing events were detected for 2350 genes, mostly due 
alternative 3'splice sites and 1732 novel transcriptionally active regions 
(nTARs) in unannotated regions were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a comprehensive genome-wide functional 
annotation of P. anserina genome, including chromatin features, cis-acting 
elements such as UTRs, alternative splicing events and transcription of 
non-coding regions. These new findings will likely improve our understanding of 
gene regulation strategies in compact genomes, such as those of filamentous 
fungi. Characterization of alternative transcripts and nTARs paves the way to 
the discovery of putative new genes, alternative peptides or regulatory 
non-coding RNAs."
16,"BACKGROUND: Möbius (Moebius) and Poland's syndromes are two rare congenital 
syndromes characterized by non-progressive bilateral (and often asymmetric) 
dysfunction of the 6th and 7th cranial nerves and hypoplasia of the pectoral 
muscles associated with chest wall and upper limb anomalies respectively. 
Manifest simultaneously as Poland-Möbius (Poland-Moebius) syndrome, debate 
continues as to whether this is a distinct nosological entity or represents 
phenotypic variation as part of a spectrum of disorders of rhomboencephalic 
development. Etiological hypotheses implicate both genetic and environmental 
factors. The PLXND1 gene codes for a protein expressed in the fetal central 
nervous system and vascular endothelium and is thus involved in embryonic 
neurogenesis and vasculogenesis. It is located at chromosome region 3q21-q22, a 
locus of interest for Möbius syndrome.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the first report of a patient with Poland-Möbius 
syndrome and a mutation in the PLXND1 gene. A child with Poland-Möbius syndrome 
and a maternally inherited missense variant 
(NM_015103.2:ex14:c.2890G > Ap.V964M) in the PLXND1 gene is described. In order 
to contextualize these findings, the literature was examined to identify other 
confirmed cases of Poland-Möbius syndrome for which genetic data were available. 
Fourteen additional cases of Poland-Möbius syndrome with genetic studies are 
described in the literature. None implicated the PLXND1 gene which has 
previously been implicated in isolated Möbius syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: This report provides further evidence in support of a role for 
PLXND1 mutations in Möbius syndrome and reasserts the nosological link between 
Möbius and Poland's syndromes.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V, Descriptive Study."
17,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial genotyping is a crucial process in outbreak investigation 
and epidemiological studies. Several typing methods such as pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and whole genome sequencing 
are currently used in routine clinical practice. However, these methods are 
costly, time-consuming and have high computational demands. An alternative to 
these methods is mini-MLST, a quick, cost-effective and robust method based on 
high-resolution melting analysis. Nevertheless, no standardized approach to 
identify markers suitable for mini-MLST exists. Here, we present a pipeline for 
variable fragment detection in unmapped reads based on a modified hybrid 
assembly approach using data from one sequencing platform.
RESULTS: In routine assembly against the reference sequence, high variable reads 
are not aligned and remain unmapped. If de novo assembly of them is performed, 
variable genomic regions can be located in created scaffolds. Based on the 
variability rates calculation, it is possible to find a highly variable region 
with the same discriminatory power as seven housekeeping gene fragments used in 
MLST. In the work presented here, we show the capability of identifying one 
variable fragment in de novo assembled scaffolds of 21 Escherichia coli genomes 
and three variable regions in scaffolds of 31 Klebsiella pneumoniae genomes. For 
each identified fragment, the melting temperatures are calculated based on the 
nearest neighbor method to verify the mini-MLST's discriminatory power.
CONCLUSIONS: A pipeline for a modified hybrid assembly approach consisting of 
reference-based mapping and de novo assembly of unmapped reads is presented. 
This approach can be employed for the identification of highly variable genomic 
fragments in unmapped reads. The identified variable regions can then be used in 
efficient laboratory methods for bacterial typing such as mini-MLST with high 
discriminatory power, fully replacing expensive methods such as MLST. The 
results can and will be delivered in a shorter time, which allows immediate and 
fast infection monitoring in clinical practice."
18,"BACKGROUND: Uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) is the most common 
female pelvic malignancy worldwide. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays an important 
role in various cellular responses, especially in cancer progression. However, 
the correlation between prognostic UCEC and m6A RNA methylation regulators 
remains unclear.
METHODS: We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to provide a gene signature that 
could improve the prognostic evaluation of UCEC patients according to the 
distinct genetic trait of m6A RNA methylation regulators from a bioinformatics 
perspective. After comparing UCEC subgroups with different genetic profiles of 
m6A regulators, we identified 71 differentially expressed genes associated with 
overall survival (OS) and generated a nine-gene signature through least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis. Finally, we 
used in vitro and in vivo tumor cell experiments as well as the immune 
correlation analysis to verify the function of each gene in the proposed gene 
signature.
RESULTS: Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves revealed 
that the proposed gene signature could predict the outcome of UCEC patients 
accurately. We found that CDKN2A mainly acted from the perspective of tumor 
cells, while COL4A4, PXDN, TIGIT, CHODL, LMO3, KCNJ12, L1CAM, and EPHB1 might 
play a role in UCEC from an immunological point of view.
CONCLUSIONS: From an epigenetics perspective, the m6A RNA methylation 
regulator-based gene signature can predict the prognosis of UCEC patients and 
immune therapeutic efficacy."
19,"Recent years, Burkholderia species have emerged as a new source of natural 
products (NPs) with increasing attractions. Genome mining suggests the 
Burkholderia genomes include many natural product biosynthetic gene clusters 
(BGCs) which are new targets for drug discovery. In order to collect more 
Burkholderia, here, a strain S-53 was isolated from the soil samples on a 
mountain area in Changde, P.R. China and verified by comparative genetic 
analysis to belong to Burkholderia. The complete genome of Burkholderia strain 
S-53 is 8.2 Mbps in size with an average G + C content of 66.35%. Its taxonomy 
was both characterized by 16S rRNA- and whole genome-based phylogenetic trees. 
Bioinformatic prediction in silico revealed it has a total of 15 NP BGCs, some 
of which may encode unknown products. It is expectable that availability of 
these BGCs will speed up the identification of new secondary metabolites from 
Burkholderia and help us understand how sophisticated BGC regulation works."
20,"Sponges are interesting animal models for regeneration studies, since even from 
dissociated cells, they are able to regenerate completely. In particular, 
explants are model systems that can be applied to many sponge species, since 
small fragments of sponges can regenerate all elements of the adult, including 
the oscula and the ability to pump water. The morphological aspects of 
regeneration in sponges are relatively well known, but the molecular machinery 
is only now starting to be elucidated for some sponge species. Here, we have 
used an explant system of the demosponge Halichondria panicea to understand the 
molecular machinery deployed during regeneration of the aquiferous system. We 
sequenced the transcriptomes of four replicates of the 5-day explant without an 
osculum (NOE), four replicates of the 17-18-day explant with a single osculum 
and pumping activity (PE) and also four replicates of field-collected 
individuals with regular pumping activity (PA), and performed differential gene 
expression analysis. We also described the morphology of NOE and PE samples 
using light and electron microscopy. Our results showed a highly disorganised 
mesohyl and disarranged aquiferous system in NOE that is coupled with 
upregulated pathways of ciliogenesis, organisation of the ECM, and cell 
proliferation and survival. Once the osculum is formed, genes involved in 
""response to stimulus in other organisms"" were upregulated. Interestingly, the 
main molecular machinery of vasculogenesis described in vertebrates was 
activated during the regeneration of the aquiferous system. Notably, 
vasculogenesis markers were upregulated when the tissue was disorganised and 
about to start forming canals (NOE) and angiogenic stimulators and ECM 
remodelling machineries were differentially expressed once the aquiferous system 
was in place (PE and PA). Our results are fundamental to better understanding 
the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of the aquiferous system in 
sponges, and its similarities with the early onset of blood-vessel formation in 
animal evolution."
21,"BACKGROUND: Single cell mRNA sequencing technologies have transformed our 
understanding of cellular heterogeneity and identity. For sensitive discovery or 
clinical marker estimation where high transcript capture per cell is needed only 
plate-based techniques currently offer sufficient resolution.
RESULTS: Here, we present a performance evaluation of four different plate-based 
scRNA-seq protocols. Our evaluation is aimed towards applications taxing high 
gene detection sensitivity, reproducibility between samples, and minimum 
hands-on time, as is required, for example, in clinical use. We included two 
commercial kits, NEBNext® Single Cell/ Low Input RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB®), 
SMART-seq® HT kit (Takara®), and the non-commercial protocols Genome & 
Transcriptome sequencing (G&T) and SMART-seq3 (SS3). G&T delivered the highest 
detection of genes per single cell. SS3 presented the highest gene detection per 
single cell at the lowest price. Takara® kit presented similar high gene 
detection per single cell, and high reproducibility between samples, but at the 
absolute highest price. NEB® delivered a lower detection of genes but remains an 
alternative to more expensive commercial kits.
CONCLUSION: For the tested kits we found that ease-of-use came at higher prices. 
Takara can be selected for its ease-of-use to analyse a few samples, but we 
recommend the cheaper G&T-seq or SS3 for laboratories where a substantial sample 
flow can be expected."
22,"BACKGROUNDS: Remarkable interindividual variability in clopidogrel response is 
observed, genetic polymorphisms in P2RY12 and its signal pathway is supposed to 
affect clopidogrel response in CHD patients.
METHODS: 539 CHD patients treated with clopidogrel were recruited. The platelet 
reaction index (PRI) indicated by VASP-P level were detected in 12-24 h after 
clopidogrel loading dose or within 5-7 days after initiation of maintain dose 
clopidogrel. A total of 13 SNPs in relevant genes were genotyped in sample A 
(239 CHD patients). The SNPs which have significant differences in PRI will be 
validated in another sample (sample B, 300 CHD patients).
RESULTS: CYP2C19*2 increased the risk of clopidogrel resistance significantly. 
When CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 were considered, CYP2C19 loss of function (LOF) 
alleles were associated with more obviously increased the risk of clopidogrel 
resistance; P2RY12 rs6809699C > A polymorphism was also associated with 
increased risk of clopidogrel resistance (AA vs CC: P = 0.0398). This difference 
still existed after stratification by CYP2C19 genotypes. It was also validated 
in sample B. The association was also still significant even in the case of 
stratification by CYP2C19 genotypes in all patients (sample A + B).
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that P2RY12 rs6809699 is associated with 
clopidogrel resistance in CHD patients. Meanwhile, the rs6809699 AA genotype can 
increase on-treatment platelet activity independent of CYP2C19 LOF 
polymorphisms."
23,"BACKGROUND: Protein, starch, amylose and total soluble sugars are basic 
metabolites of seed that influence the eating, cooking and nutritional qualities 
of rice. Chlorophyll is responsible for the absorption and utilization of the 
light energy influencing photosynthetic efficiency in rice plant. Mapping of 
these traits are very important for detection of more number of robust markers 
for improvement of these traits through molecular breeding approaches.
RESULTS: A representative panel population was developed by including 120 
germplasm lines from the initial shortlisted 274 lines for mapping of the six 
biochemical traits using 136 microsatellite markers through association mapping. 
A wide genetic variation was detected for the traits, total protein, starch, 
amylose, total soluble sugars, chlorophyll a, and chlorophyll b content in the 
population. Specific allele frequency, gene diversity, informative markers and 
other diversity parameters obtained from the population indicated the 
effectiveness of utilization of the population and markers for mapping of these 
traits. The fixation indices values estimated from the population indicated the 
existence of linkage disequilibrium for the six traits. The population genetic 
structure at K = 3 showed correspondence with majority of the members in each 
group for the six traits. The reported QTL, qProt1, qPC6.2, and qPC8.2 for 
protein content; qTSS8.1 for total soluble sugar; qAC1.2 for amylose content; 
qCH2 and qSLCHH for chlorophyll a (Chl. a) while qChl5D for chlorophyll b (Chl. 
b) were validated in this population. The QTL controlling total protein content 
qPC1.2; qTSS7.1, qTSS8.2 and qTSS12.1 for total soluble sugars; qSC2.1, qSC2.2, 
qSC6.1 and qSC11.1 for starch content; qAC11.1, qAC11.2 and qAC11.3 for amylose 
content; qChla8.1 for Chl. a content and qChlb7.1 and qChlb8.1 for Chl. b 
identified by both Generalized Linear Model and Mixed Linear Model were detected 
as novel QTL. The chromosomal regions on chromosome 8 at 234 cM for grain 
protein content and total soluble sugars and at 363 cM for Chl. a and Chl. b 
along with the position at 48 cM on chromosome 11 for starch and amylose content 
are genetic hot spots for these traits.
CONCLUSION: The validated, co-localized and the novel QTL detected in this study 
will be useful for improvement of protein, starch, amylose, total soluble sugars 
and chlorophyll content in rice."
24,"Environmental contamination by xenobiotics represents a major threat for natural 
ecosystems and public health. In response, xenobiotic detoxification is a 
fundamental trait of organisms for developmental plasticity and stress 
tolerance, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood in 
plants. To decipher this process, we explored the consequences of allopolyploidy 
on xenobiotic tolerance in the genus Spartina Schreb. Specifically, we focused 
on microRNAs (miRNAs) owing to their central function in the regulation of gene 
expression patterns, including responses to stress. Small RNA-Seq was conducted 
on the parents S. alterniflora and S. maritima, their F1 hybrid S. x townsendii 
and the allopolyploid S. anglica under phenanthrene-induced stress (phe), a 
model Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) compound. Differentially expressed 
miRNAs in response to phe were specifically identified within species. In 
complement, the respective impacts of hybridization and genome doubling were 
detected, through changes in miRNA expression patterns between S. x townsendii, 
S. anglica and the parents. The results support the impact of allopolyploidy in 
miRNA-guided regulation of plant response to phe. In total, we identified 17 
phe-responsive miRNAs in Spartina among up-regulated MIR156 and down-regulated 
MIR159. We also describe novel phe-responsive miRNAs as putative 
Spartina-specific gene expression regulators in response to stress. Functional 
validation using Arabidopsis (L.) Heynh. T-DNA lines inserted in homologous MIR 
genes was performed, and the divergence of phe-responsive miRNA regulatory 
networks between Arabidopsis and Spartina was discussed."
25,"Orthodontic tooth movement relies on bone remodeling and periodontal tissue 
regeneration in response to the complicated mechanical cues on the compressive 
and tensive side. In general, mechanical stimulus regulates the expression of 
mechano-sensitive coding and non-coding genes, which in turn affects how cells 
are involved in bone remodeling. Growing numbers of non-coding RNAs, 
particularly mechano-sensitive non-coding RNA, have been verified to be 
essential for the regulation of osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis and have 
revealed how they interact with signaling molecules to do so. This review 
summarizes recent findings of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs and long 
non-coding RNAs, as crucial regulators of gene expression responding to 
mechanical stimulation, and outlines their roles in bone deposition and 
resorption. We focused on multiple mechano-sensitive miRNAs such as miR-21, 
- 29, -34, -103, -494-3p, -1246, -138-5p, -503-5p, and -3198 that play a 
critical role in osteogenesis function and bone resorption. The emerging roles 
of force-dependent regulation of lncRNAs in bone remodeling are also discussed 
extensively. We summarized mechano-sensitive lncRNA XIST, H19, and MALAT1 along 
with other lncRNAs involved in osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Ultimately, 
we look forward to the prospects of the novel application of non-coding RNAs as 
potential therapeutics for tooth movement and periodontal tissue regeneration."
26,"The process in which locally confined epithelial malignancies progressively 
evolve into invasive cancers is often promoted by unjamming, a phase transition 
from a solid-like to a liquid-like state, which occurs in various tissues. 
Whether this tissue-level mechanical transition impacts phenotypes during 
carcinoma progression remains unclear. Here we report that the large 
fluctuations in cell density that accompany unjamming result in repeated 
mechanical deformations of cells and nuclei. This triggers a cellular 
mechano-protective mechanism involving an increase in nuclear size and rigidity, 
heterochromatin redistribution and remodelling of the perinuclear actin 
architecture into actin rings. The chronic strains and stresses associated with 
unjamming together with the reduction of Lamin B1 levels eventually result in 
DNA damage and nuclear envelope ruptures, with the release of cytosolic DNA that 
activates a cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-signalling adaptor stimulator of 
interferon genes)-dependent cytosolic DNA response gene program. This 
mechanically driven transcriptional rewiring ultimately alters the cell state, 
with the emergence of malignant traits, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal 
plasticity phenotypes and chemoresistance in invasive breast carcinoma."
27,"PURPOSE: To compare the perioperative and oncologic outcomes between minimally 
invasive pelvic organ-preserving radical cystectomy (MIPOPRC) and open pelvic 
organ-preserving radical cystectomy (open POPRC) among female patients with 
bladder cancer (BCa).
METHODS: We identified female patients who underwent POPRC for BCa at three 
centers between January 2006 and April 2018. Female patients who underwent open 
POPRC were matched with those who underwent MIPOPRC using 1:1 propensity score 
(PS) matching. The patient demographics and perioperative and oncologic outcomes 
were evaluated for the comparison between MIPOPRC and open POPRC.
RESULTS: Among the 158 patients enrolled, 83 patients underwent MIPOPRC, and 75 
underwent open POPRC. A total of 60 MIPOPRC and 60 open POPRC patients were 
matched successfully. The cancer-specific survival (CSS) and recurrence-free 
survival (RFS) did not differ significantly in the propensity score-weighted 
cohort (p = 0.297 and p = 0.600, respectively). Subgroup analysis by age and 
pathologic stage in the matched cohort revealed that CSS and RFS were with no 
differences among all subgroups. Moreover, multivariable Cox regression analyses 
showed that the surgical approach (MIPOPRC vs open POPRC) was not a predictor of 
CSS (p = 0.250).
CONCLUSION: MIPOPRC was non-inferior to open POPRC in terms of oncologic 
outcomes among female patients. MIPOPRC could be technically feasible in 
selected female patients with BCa."
28,"To survive, plants constantly adapt their body shape to their environment. This 
often involves remarkably rapid bending of their organs such as stems, leaves 
and roots. Since plant cells are enclosed by stiff cell walls, they use various 
strategies for bending their organs, which differ from bending mechanisms of 
soft animal tissues and involve larger physical forces. Here we attempt to 
summarize and link different viewpoints on bending mechanisms: genes and 
signalling, mathematical modelling and biomechanics. We argue that quantifying 
cell growth and physical forces could open a new level in our understanding of 
bending and resolve some of its paradoxes."
29,"Regulatory T (Treg) cells maintain immune homeostasis by preventing abnormal or 
excessive immune responses. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) regulates expression 
of Foxp3, and thus, Treg cell differentiation; however, its role in Treg cell 
differentiation is unclear and somewhat controversial. Here, we investigated the 
role of HDAC6 in TGF-β-induced murine Treg cells. HDAC6 expression was higher in 
Treg cells than in other T helper cell subsets. Pharmacological inhibitors of 
HDAC6 selectively inhibited Treg cell differentiation and suppressive function. 
A specific HDAC6 inhibitor induced changes in global gene expression by Treg 
cells. Of these changes, genes related to cell division were prominently 
affected. In summary, HDAC6 plays an important role in TGF-β-induced murine Treg 
cell differentiation by regulating cell proliferation."
30,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy with poor prognosis 
and limited treatment options. Here we provide a comprehensive census of the 
bone marrow immune microenvironment in adult and pediatric patients with AML. We 
characterize unique inflammation signatures in a subset of AML patients, 
associated with inferior outcomes. We identify atypical B cells, a dysfunctional 
B-cell subtype enriched in patients with high-inflammation AML, as well as an 
increase in CD8+GZMK+ and regulatory T cells, accompanied by a reduction in 
T-cell clonal expansion. We derive an inflammation-associated gene score 
(iScore) that associates with poor survival outcomes in patients with AML. 
Addition of the iScore refines current risk stratifications for patients with 
AML and may enable identification of patients in need of more aggressive 
treatment. This work provides a framework for classifying patients with AML 
based on their immune microenvironment and a rationale for consideration of the 
inflammatory state in clinical settings."
31,"The inhibitory receptor PD-1 suppresses T cell activation by recruiting the 
phosphatase SHP-2. However, mice with a T-cell-specific deletion of SHP-2 do not 
have improved antitumor immunity. Here we showed that mice with conditional 
targeting of SHP-2 in myeloid cells, but not in T cells, had diminished tumor 
growth. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) followed by gene set enrichment analysis 
indicated the presence of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells and 
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with enriched gene expression profiles of 
enhanced differentiation, activation and expression of immunostimulatory 
molecules. In mice with conditional targeting of PD-1 in myeloid cells, which 
also displayed diminished tumor growth, TAMs had gene expression profiles 
enriched for myeloid differentiation, activation and leukocyte-mediated immunity 
displaying >50% overlap with enriched profiles of SHP-2-deficient TAMs. In bone 
marrow, GM-CSF induced the phosphorylation of PD-1 and recruitment of PD-1-SHP-2 
to the GM-CSF receptor. Deletion of SHP-2 or PD-1 enhanced GM-CSF-mediated 
phosphorylation of the transcription factors HOXA10 and IRF8, which regulate 
myeloid differentiation and monocytic-moDC lineage commitment, respectively. 
Thus, SHP-2 and PD-1-SHP-2 signaling restrained myelocyte differentiation 
resulting in a myeloid landscape that suppressed antitumor immunity."
32,"Networks are powerful tools to uncover functional roles of genes in phenotypic 
variation at a system-wide scale. Here, we constructed a maize network map that 
contains the genomic, transcriptomic, translatomic and proteomic networks across 
maize development. This map comprises over 2.8 million edges in more than 1,400 
functional subnetworks, demonstrating an extensive network divergence of 
duplicated genes. We applied this map to identify factors regulating flowering 
time and identified 2,651 genes enriched in eight subnetworks. We validated the 
functions of 20 genes, including 18 with previously unknown connections to 
flowering time in maize. Furthermore, we uncovered a flowering pathway involving 
histone modification. The multi-omics integrative network map illustrates the 
principles of how molecular networks connect different types of genes and 
potential pathways to map a genome-wide functional landscape in maize, which 
should be applicable in a wide range of species."
33,"Decellularized extracellular matrix in the form of patches and locally injected 
hydrogels has long been used as therapies in animal models of disease. Here we 
report the safety and feasibility of an intravascularly infused extracellular 
matrix as a biomaterial for the repair of tissue in animal models of acute 
myocardial infarction, traumatic brain injury and pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. The biomaterial consists of decellularized, enzymatically digested 
and fractionated ventricular myocardium, localizes to injured tissues by binding 
to leaky microvasculature, and is largely degraded in about 3 d. In rats and 
pigs with induced acute myocardial infarction followed by intracoronary infusion 
of the biomaterial, we observed substantially reduced left ventricular volumes 
and improved wall-motion scores, as well as differential expression of genes 
associated with tissue repair and inflammation. Delivering pro-healing 
extracellular matrix by intravascular infusion post injury may provide 
translational advantages for the healing of inflamed tissues 'from the inside 
out'."
34,"The RON receptor tyrosine kinase is an exceptionally interesting target in 
oncology and immunology. It is not only overexpressed in a wide variety of 
tumors but also has been shown to be expressed on myeloid cells associated with 
tumor infiltration, where it serves to dampen tumour immune responses and reduce 
the efficacy of anti-CTLA4 therapy. Potent and selective inhibitory antibodies 
to RON might therefore both inhibit tumor cell growth and stimulate immune 
rejection of tumors. We derived cloned and sequenced a new panel of 
exceptionally avid anti-RON antibodies with picomolar binding affinities that 
inhibit MSP-induced RON signaling and show remarkable potency in antibody 
dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Antibody specificity was validated by cloning 
the antibody genes and creating recombinant antibodies and by the use of RON 
knock out cell lines. When radiolabeled with 89-Zirconium, the new antibodies 
3F8 and 10G1 allow effective immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) 
imaging of RON-expressing tumors and recognize universally exposed RON epitopes 
at the cell surface. The 10G1 was further developed into a novel bispecific T 
cell engager with a 15 pM EC50 in cytotoxic T cell killing assays."
35,"Tinnitus, a phantom perception of sound in the absence of any external sound 
source, is a prevalent health condition often accompanied by psychiatric 
comorbidities. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) highlighted a 
polygenic nature of tinnitus susceptibility. A shared genetic component between 
tinnitus and psychiatric conditions remains elusive. Here we present a GWAS 
using the UK Biobank to investigate the genetic processes linked to tinnitus and 
tinnitus-related distress, followed by gene-set enrichment analyses. The UK 
Biobank sample comprised 132,438 individuals with tinnitus and genotype data. 
Among the study sample, 38,525 individuals reported tinnitus, and 26,889 
participants mentioned they experienced tinnitus-related distress in daily 
living. The genome-wide association analyses were conducted on tinnitus and 
tinnitus-related distress. We conducted enrichment analyses using FUMA to 
further understand the genetic processes linked to tinnitus and tinnitus-related 
distress. A genome-wide significant locus (lead SNP: rs71595470) for tinnitus 
was obtained in the vicinity of GPM6A. Nineteen independent loci reached 
suggestive association with tinnitus. Fifteen independent loci reached 
suggestive association with tinnitus-related distress. The enrichment analysis 
revealed a shared genetic component between tinnitus and psychiatric traits, 
such as bipolar disorder, feeling worried, cognitive ability, fast beta 
electroencephalogram, and sensation seeking. Metabolic, cardiovascular, 
hematological, and pharmacological gene sets revealed a significant association 
with tinnitus. Anxiety and stress-related gene sets revealed a significant 
association with tinnitus-related distress. The GWAS signals for tinnitus were 
enriched in the hippocampus and cortex, and for tinnitus-related distress were 
enriched in the brain and spinal cord. This study provides novel insights into 
genetic processes associated with tinnitus and tinnitus-related distress and 
demonstrates a shared genetic component underlying tinnitus and psychiatric 
conditions. Further collaborative attempts are necessary to identify genetic 
components underlying the phenotypic heterogeneity in tinnitus and provide 
biological insight into the etiology."
36,"Prion diseases are characterized by the cellular prion protein, PrPC, misfolding 
and aggregating into the infectious prion protein, PrPSc, which leads to 
neurodegeneration and death. An early sign of disease is inflammation in the 
brain and the shift of resting glial cells to reactive astrocytes and activated 
microglia. Few therapeutics target this stage of disease. Mesenchymal stromal 
cells produce anti-inflammatory molecules when exposed to inflammatory signals 
and damaged tissue. Here, we show that adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells 
(AdMSCs) migrate toward prion-infected brain homogenate and produce the 
anti-inflammatory molecules transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) and tumor 
necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6). In an in vitro model of prion 
exposure of both primary mixed glia and BV2 microglial cell line, co-culturing 
with AdMSCs led to a significant decrease in inflammatory cytokine mRNA and 
markers of reactive astrocytes and activated microglia. This protection against 
in vitro prion-associated inflammatory responses is independent of PrPSc 
replication. These data support a role for AdMSCs as a beneficial therapeutic 
for decreasing the early onset of glial inflammation and reprogramming glial 
cells to a protective phenotype."
37,"Genome mining in silico approaches allow scientists to proficiently evaluate the 
genomic potency of secondary bioactive chemical producers and find new bioactive 
compounds in different bacteria. Streptomyces is one of the most ubiquitous 
bacterial genera in the environments, and well-known as prolific producers of 
diverse and valuable natural products (NPs) with significant biological 
activities. Mining and prioritizing of NP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) 
would be the most important stage in the identification of novel compounds. 
Comparative genomics and genetic similarity network analysis of 62 Streptomyces 
public reference genomes demonstrated that individuals of these species exhibit 
a huge number of distinct NP BGCs, the most of which are cryptic and unconnected 
to any reported NPs with high phylogenetic variation among individuals. It was 
assumed that substantial heterogeneity across the varieties of species of 
Streptomyces drives outstanding biosynthetic and metabolic potential, making 
them plausible candidates for the identification of novel molecules."
38,"The main attempt of this study is to isolate, determine potential probiotic 
properties and enzyme production of some lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Among all 
isolates, two LAB strains isolated from human mother milk and cottage cheese 
revealed antimicrobial activity against some tested pathogenic strains. Both 
isolates inhibited all the tested pathogens except Escherichia coli. The two 
isolates were identified by morphological, biochemical properties and then by 
16S rRNA gene sequencing technique as Lactobacillus acidophilus SAM1 and 
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SAM2. Potential probiotic characters were 
investigated. Both strains survived in relatively low pH and high bile 
concentrations and were able to grow at 0.5% of pancreatin concentrations. Their 
growth decreased by increasing phenol from 0.2% till 0.5%. Both strains did not 
show hemolytic activity. Coaggregation potential was exhibited by the two 
strains against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Hydrophobicity of 
Lactobacillus acidophilus SAM1 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SAM2, with 
ethyl acetate; were 88.1% and 82.8%, respectively. Lactobacillus acidophilus 
SAM1 was susceptible to Ampicillin, Penicillin, Erythromycin, Ciprofloxacin and 
Tetracycline; on the contrary, it resists Vancomycin and Cefoxitin; while 
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SAM2 resists all tested antibiotics. Maximum 
growth was achieved using glucose as a carbon source and yeast extract as 
nitrogen source for both strains; however, glucose is the most preferred carbon 
source for microorganisms and it prevents the uptake of carbon from other 
sources like yeast by catabolite repression mechanism. Lactobacillus acidophilus 
SAM1 produces lipase enzyme, while Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SAM2 produces 
amylase and protease."
39,"Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a widely used method to study gene expression changes 
following brain injury. The accuracy of this method depends on the tissue 
harvested, the time course analyzed and, in particular on the choice of 
appropriate internal controls, i.e., reference genes (RGs). In the present study 
we have developed and validated an algorithm for the accurate normalization of 
qPCR data using laser microdissected tissue from the mouse dentate gyrus after 
entorhinal denervation at 0, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days postlesion. The expression 
stabilities of ten candidate RGs were evaluated in the denervated granule cell 
layer (gcl) and outer molecular layer (oml) of the dentate gyrus. Advanced 
software algorithms demonstrated differences in stability for single RGs in the 
two layers at several time points postlesion. In comparison, a normalization 
index of several stable RGs covered the entire post-lesional time course and 
showed high stability. Using these RGs, we validated our findings and quantified 
glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap) mRNA and allograft inflammatory factor 1 
(Aif1/Iba1) mRNA in the denervated oml. We compared the use of single RGs for 
normalization with the normalization index and found that single RGs yield 
variable results. In contrast, the normalization index gave stable results. In 
sum, our study shows that qPCR can yield precise, reliable, and reproducible 
datasets even under such complex conditions as brain injury or denervation, 
provided appropriate RGs for the model are used. The algorithm reported here can 
easily be adapted and transferred to any other brain injury model."
40,"Indian cultural influence is remarkable in present-day Mainland Southeast Asia 
(MSEA), and it may have stimulated early state formation in the region. Various 
present-day populations in MSEA harbor a low level of South Asian ancestry, but 
previous studies failed to detect such ancestry in any ancient individual from 
MSEA. In this study, we discovered a substantial level of South Asian admixture 
(ca. 40-50%) in a Protohistoric individual from the Vat Komnou cemetery at the 
Angkor Borei site in Cambodia. The location and direct radiocarbon dating result 
on the human bone (95% confidence interval is 78-234 calCE) indicate that this 
individual lived during the early period of Funan, one of the earliest states in 
MSEA, which shows that the South Asian gene flow to Cambodia started about a 
millennium earlier than indicated by previous published results of genetic 
dating relying on present-day populations. Plausible proxies for the South Asian 
ancestry source in this individual are present-day populations in Southern 
India, and the individual shares more genetic drift with present-day Cambodians 
than with most present-day East and Southeast Asian populations."
41,"Fibrosis is an important pathological mechanism in heart failure (HF) and is 
associated with poor prognosis. We analyzed fibrosis in HF patients using 
transcriptomic data. Genes differentially expressed between normal control and 
congestive HF (CHF) dogs included P3H1, P3H2, P3H4, P4HA2, PLOD1 and PLOD3, 
which belong to the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2OGD) superfamily 
that stabilizes collagen during fibrosis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
analysis demonstrated 2OGD gene expression was increased in CHF samples compared 
with normal left ventricle (LV) samples. 2OGD gene expression was repressed in 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-treated samples. These genes, activated 
the hydroxylation of proline or lysin residues of procollagen mediated by 
2-oxoglutaric acid and O2, produce succinic acid and CO2. Metabolic analysis 
demonstrated the concentration of succinic acid was significantly increased in 
CHF samples compared with normal LV samples. Fibrosis was induced in human 
cardiac fibroblasts by TGF-ß1 treatment. After treatment, the gene and protein 
expressions of 2OGD, the concentration of succinic acid, and the oxygen 
consumption rate were increased compared with no treatment. This is the first 
study to show that collagen-related 2OGD genes contribute to HF during the 
induction of fibrosis and might be potential therapeutic targets for fibrosis 
and HF."
42,"Pneumoconiosis is the most common and serious disease among coal miners. In 
earlier work on this subject, we documented that coal dust (CD) nanoparticles 
(CD-NPs) induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF) more profoundly than did CD micron 
particles (CD-MPs), but the mechanism has not been thoroughly studied. Based on 
the GEO database, jveen, STRING, and Cytoscape tools were used to screen hub 
genes regulating PF. Particle size distribution of CD were analyzed with Malvern 
nanoparticle size potentiometer. Combining 8 computational methods, we found 
that IGF1, POSTN, MMP7, ASPN, and CXCL14 may act as hub genes regulating PF. 
Based on the high score of IGF1 and its important regulatory role in various 
tissue fibrosis, we selected it as the target gene in this study. Activation of 
the IGF1/IGF1R axis promoted CD-NPs-induced PF, and inhibition of the axis 
activation had the opposite effect in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, activation 
of the IGF1/IGF1R axis induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to 
promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in alveolar epithelial cells 
(AECs) to accelerate PF. High-throughput gene sequencing based on lung tissue 
suggested that cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and the NF-kB signaling 
pathway play a key role in PF. Also, ROS induced inflammation and EMT by the 
activation of the NF-kB/NLRP3 axis to accelerate PF. ROS can induce the 
activation of AKT/GSK3β signaling, and inhibition of it can inhibit ROS-induced 
inflammation and EMT by the NF-kB/NLRP3 axis, thereby inhibiting PF. CD-NPs 
induced PF by promoting inflammation and EMT via the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway driven 
by IGF1/ROS-mediated AKT/GSK3β signals. This study provides a valuable 
experimental basis for the prevention and treatment of coal workers' 
pneumoconiosis. Illustration of the overall research idea of this study: IGF1 
stimulates coal dust nanoparticles induced pulmonary fibrosis by promoting 
inflammation and EMT via the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway driven by ROS-mediated 
AKT/GSK3β signals."
43,"One goal of regenerative medicine is to rejuvenate tissues and extend lifespan 
by restoring the function of endogenous aged stem cells. However, evidence that 
somatic stem cells can be targeted in vivo to extend lifespan is still lacking. 
Here, we demonstrate that after a short systemic treatment with a specific 
inhibitor of the small RhoGTPase Cdc42 (CASIN), transplanting aged hematopoietic 
stem cells (HSCs) from treated mice is sufficient to extend the healthspan and 
lifespan of aged immunocompromised mice without additional treatment. In detail, 
we show that systemic CASIN treatment improves strength and endurance of aged 
mice by increasing the myogenic regenerative potential of aged skeletal muscle 
stem cells. Further, we show that CASIN modifies niche localization and H4K16ac 
polarity of HSCs in vivo. Single-cell profiling reveals changes in HSC 
transcriptome, which underlie enhanced lymphoid and regenerative capacity in 
serial transplantation assays. Overall, we provide proof-of-concept evidence 
that a short systemic treatment to decrease Cdc42 activity improves the 
regenerative capacity of different endogenous aged stem cells in vivo, and that 
rejuvenated HSCs exert a broad systemic effect sufficient to extend murine 
health- and lifespan."
44,"Diabetic macular edema (DME), a complication of diabetes mellitus, is a leading 
cause of adult-onset blindness worldwide. Recently, intravitreal anti-VEGF 
injection has been used as a first-line treatment. This study analyzed the 
association between the genetic profile of patients with DME and their response 
to treatment. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections were administered monthly for 
three months to Korean patients diagnosed with DME, who were classified into two 
groups depending on whether they responded to anti-VEGF therapy or showed 
recurrence within six months. Peripheral blood samples were used for genetic 
analyses. Genome-wide association analysis results sowed that the genes DIRC3 on 
chromosome 2 (rs16857280, p = 1.2 × 10-6), SLCO3A1 on chromosome 15 (rs12899055, 
p = 2.5 × 10-6), and RAB2A on chromosome 8 (rs2272620, p = 4.6 × 10-6) were 
associated with treatment response to intravitreal anti-VEGF injection. SLC35F1, 
TMEM132D, KIAA0368, HPCAL1, IGF2BP3, SPN2S, COL23A1, and CREB5 were also related 
to treatment response (p < 5.0 × 10-5). Using the KEGG pathway analysis, RAB2A 
and CREB5 were found to be associated with AMPK signaling related to VEGF 
(p = 0.018). The identified genetic biomarkers can elucidate the factors 
affecting patient response to intravitreal anti-VEGF injection and help select 
appropriate therapeutic strategy."
45,"The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant emerged showing higher transmissibility and 
possibly higher resistance to current COVID-19 vaccines than other variants 
dominating the global pandemic. In March 2020 we performed a study in clinical 
samples, where we found that a portion of genomes in the SARS-CoV-2 viral 
population accumulated deletions immediately before the S1/S2 cleavage site 
(furin-like cleavage site, PRRAR/S) of the spike gene, generating a frameshift 
and appearance of a premature stop codon. The main aim of this study was to 
determine the frequency of defective deletions in prevalent variants from the 
first to sixth pandemic waves in our setting and discuss whether the differences 
observed might support epidemiological proposals. The complete SARS-CoV-2 spike 
gene was deeply studied by next-generation sequencing using the MiSeq platform. 
More than 90 million reads were obtained from respiratory swab specimens of 78 
COVID-19 patients with mild infection caused by the predominant variants 
circulating in the Barcelona city area during the six pandemic waves: B.1.5, 
B.1.1, B.1.177, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron. The frequency of defective 
genomes found in variants dominating the first and second waves was similar to 
that seen in Omicron, but differed from the frequencies seen in the Alpha, Beta 
and Delta variants. The changing pattern of mutations seen in the various 
SARS-CoV-2 variants driving the pandemic waves over time can affect viral 
transmission and immune escape. Here we discuss the putative biological effects 
of defective deletions naturally occurring before the S1/S2 cleavage site during 
adaption of the virus to human infection."
46,"Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.25) plays a crucial role in plant 
adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the current knowledge about 
PAL proteins in sorghum is essentially lacking. Thus, in this study we aimed to 
analyze the PAL family genes in sorghum using a genome-wide approach and to 
explore the role of PAL genes in host plant resistance to aphids via SA-mediated 
defense signaling. Here, we report gene structural features of 8 PAL (SbPAL) 
genes in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), their phylogeny, protein motifs and promoter 
analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the SbPAL genes were induced by 
sugarcane aphid (SCA) infestation and SbPAL exhibited differential gene 
expression in susceptible and resistant genotypes. PAL activity assays further 
validated upregulated expression of the SbPAL genes in a resistant genotype. In 
addition, exogenous application of SA reduced plant damage and suppressed aphid 
population growth and fecundity in susceptible genotype, suggesting that those 
SbPAL genes act as positive regulator of the SA-mediated defense signaling 
pathway to combat aphid pests in sorghum. This study provides insights for 
further examination of the defense role of PAL in sorghum against other pests 
and pathogens."
47,"Verticillium species are known as plant pathogens responsible for wilt diseases 
in a large variety of dicotyledon plants and crops in many parts of the world. 
Here we present the draft genome sequence of Verticillium dahliae Kleb. (strain 
VdGL16) isolated in Italy from the invasive alien species Ailanthus altissima 
(Mill.; commonly known as tree-of-heaven) showing Verticillium wilt symptoms. 
The comparison between the newly sequenced genome with those publicly available 
revealed candidate genes putatively involved in pathogenicity. The genome 
represents a new useful source for future research on Verticillium genetics and 
biology as well as research on novel approaches in the control of A. altissima."
48,"Regulation of neuronal metabolism during early brain development is crucial for 
directing synaptic plasticity and proper circuit formation. Alterations in 
neuronal glycolysis or mitochondrial function are associated with several 
neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Recently, loss-of-function 
mutations in SETD1A, a histone methyltransferase, have been linked to increased 
schizophrenia risk and global developmental delay. Here, we show that 
heterozygous disruption of SETD1A in human induced pluripotent stem cell 
(hiPSC)-derived neurons results in reduced neurite outgrowth and spontaneous 
activity, two phenotypes commonly associated with schizophrenia, as well as 
alterations in metabolic capacity. Furthermore, supplementing culture media with 
metabolic intermediates ameliorated changes in neurite outgrowth and spontaneous 
activity, suggesting that metabolic dysfunction contributes to neuronal 
phenotypes caused by SETD1A haploinsufficiency. These findings highlight a 
previously unknown connection between SETD1A function, metabolic regulation, and 
neuron development, and identifies alternative avenues for therapeutic 
development."
49,"Magnolia sinostellata is one of the endangered species in China and largely 
suffers light deficiency stress in the understory of forest. However, the weak 
light response molecular mechanism remains unclear. More importantly, hub genes 
in the molecular network have not been pinpointed. To explore potential 
regulators in the mechanism, weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
(WGCNA) was performed to analysis the trancriptome data of M. sinostellata 
leaves subjected to weak light with different time points. Gene co-expression 
analysis illustrated that module 1, 2 and 3 were closely associated with light 
deficiency treatment, which. Gene ontology and KEGG analyses showed that genes 
in module 1 mainly participated in amino and nucleotide metabolism, module 2 
mostly involved in carbon fixation and module 3 mostly regulated photosynthesis 
related pathways, among which 6, 7 and 8 hub genes were identified, 
respectively. Hub genes isoform_107196 in module 1 and isoform_55976 in module 2 
were unique to M. sinostellata. This study found that light deficiency inhibited 
photosynthesis and stress tolerance, while improved carbon metabolism and 
flowering related pathways in M. sinostellata, which can impact its accumulation 
reserves of growth and reproduction in the next season. In addition, key shade 
response regulators identified in this study have laid a firm foundation for 
further investigation of shade response molecular mechanism and protection of 
other shade sensitive plants."
50,"The human gut microbiome has been extensively explored, while the archaeal 
viruses remain largely unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the 
archaeal viruses from the human gut metagenomes and the existing virus 
collections using the CRISPR spacer and viral signature-based approach. This 
results in 1279 viral species, of which, 95.2% infect Methanobrevibacteria_A, 
56.5% shared high identity (>95%) with the archaeal proviruses, 37.2% have a 
host range across archaeal species, and 55.7% are highly prevalent in the human 
population (>1%). A methanogenic archaeal virus-specific gene for pseudomurein 
endoisopeptidase (PeiW) frequently occurs in the viral sequences (n = 150). 
Analysis of 33 Caudoviricetes viruses with a complete genome often discovers the 
genes (integrase, n = 29; mazE, n = 10) regulating the viral lysogenic-lytic 
cycle, implying the dominance of temperate viruses in the archaeal virome. 
Together, our work uncovers the unexplored diversity of archaeal viruses, 
revealing the novel facet of the human gut microbiome."
51,"PHD-finger domain protein 5A (PHF5A) is a member of the PHD-finger like protein 
superfamily and widely expressed in the nucleus of eukaryotes. The PHD-finger 
like domain is a protein-DNA or protein-protein interaction region. In addition 
to regulate alternative splicing of target genes as a spliceosome protein 
subunit, PHF5A is also involved in pluripotency maintenance of embryonic stem 
cells, chromatin remodeling, DNA damage repair, embryogenesis and 
histomorphological development. Recently, increasing studies have focused on 
exploring spliceosome-related and non-spliceosome-related functions of PHF5A and 
its relationship with the tumorigenesis, development and patient prognosis of 
various malignant tumors, such as breast cancer, lung cancer and colorectal 
cancer. The underlying mechanisms of PHF5A may include mediating aberrant 
alternative splicing of target genes, activating downstream signaling pathways 
as an oncogene/protein, and regulating abnormal gene transcription as a nuclear 
transcription factor or cofactor. Besides, PHF5A was also found to be involved 
in the growth regulation of cancer stem cells. In this review, we aimed to 
delineate the structural and functional characteristics of PHF5A, to summarize 
its role in the occurrence and development of malignant tumors hitherto 
described, and to provide potential targets for anti-tumor therapy."
52,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the molecular biological mechanisms of Chinese herbal 
medicines for the treatment of gastric precancerous lesions by data mining and 
network pharmacology.
METHODS: The keywords ""gastric precancerous lesions""""gastric precancerous 
disease""""gastric mucosal intraepithelial neoplasia""""gastric mucosal 
heterogeneous hyperplasia""""gastric precancerous state""""chronic gastritis, 
atrophic""""combined Chinese and Western medicine""""Chinese medicine 
therapy""""efficacy evaluation"" ""randomized controlled trial""were searched in 
China Journal Full-text Database, Wanfang Data, VIP database, PubMed and Embase 
from 2001 to 2021. The information was extracted from the literature which met 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the database was constructed to 
identify the high-frequency herbal medicines. The top six Chinese herbal 
medicines were analyzed by the network pharmacology methods, including the 
acquisition of herbs compounds and gastric precancerous lesions targets using 
Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform and GeneCards databases, 
construction of protein-protein interaction network, and screening of core 
targets, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
enrichment analysis of core targets through Metascape platform, etc., to 
elucidate their active components, targets and pathways.
RESULTS: A total of 482 compound prescriptions with 603 herbal medicines were 
included, and the top 6 herbal medicines with higher application frequency were 
Ume plum (63.35%), Curcuma longa (58.54%), Paeonia lactiflora (54.06%), Salvia 
miltiorrhiza (49.92%), Rhizoma alba (46.43%), and Astragalus membranaceus 
(45.44%). The results of the network pharmacological analysis showed that the 
active ingredients were 4 types from Ume plum, 3 from Curcuma longa, 9 from 
Paeonia lactiflora, 13 from Salvia miltiorrhiza, 7 from Astragalus alba, and 9 
from Astragalus; 77 predicted targets were in Ume plum, 11 in Curcuma longa, 33 
in Paeonia lactiflora, 58 in Salvia miltiorrhiza, 65 in Astragalus alba and 89 
in Astragalus; and 98 crossover genes were obtained after these targets were 
compared with the disease genes, among which HSP90AA1, AKT1, TP53, STAT3, MAPK1 
and TNF had higher relevance to the treatment of gastric precancerous lesions. 
The results of the GO enrichment analysis showed that the active ingredients of 
high frequency Chinese medicine mostly acted through biological processes such 
as response to inorganic substance, response to hormone, gland development, 
positive regulation of cell migration, positive regulation of cell motility, 
etc. The targets include cellular components such as vesicle lumen, secretory 
granule lumen, cytoplasmic vesicle lumen, transcription regulator complex, and 
with molecular functions such as kinase binding, protein kinase binding and 
DNA-binding transcription factor binding. The results of the KEGG pathway 
enrichment analysis showed that Paeonia lactiflora, Ulmus lucidus, Salvia 
miltiorrhiza and Astragalus mainly act through the cancer pathway and PI3K-AKT 
pathway; Curcuma longa and Rhizoma alba mainly act through the cancer pathway 
and proteoglycans in cancer, and all six herbs were involved in the cancer 
pathway and five herbs are involved in the PI3K-AKT pathway.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we obtained the top 6 high-frequency Chinese herbal 
medicines in the treatment of gastric precancerous lesions by data mining 
method, and revealed that their mechanisms are involved in cell proliferation, 
differentiation, immunity, inflammation and other processes mainly through 
cancer pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer."
53,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe 
irreversible central vision loss in individuals over 65 years old. Genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) have shown that the region at chromosome 10q26, 
where the age-related maculopathy susceptibility (ARMS2/LOC387715) and HtrA 
serine peptidase 1 (HTRA1) genes are located, represents one of the strongest 
associated loci for AMD. However, the underlying biological mechanism of this 
genetic association has remained elusive. In this article, we extensively review 
the literature by us and others regarding the ARMS2/HTRA1 risk alleles and their 
functional significance. We also review the literature regarding the presumed 
function of the ARMS2 protein and the molecular processes of the HTRA1 protein 
in AMD pathogenesis in vitro and in vivo, including those of transgenic mice 
overexpressing HtrA1/HTRA1 which developed Bruch's membrane (BM) damage, 
choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), 
similar to human AMD patients. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of 
the ARMS2 and HTRA1 susceptibility loci has begun to untangle the complex 
biological pathways underlying AMD pathophysiology, pointing to new testable 
paradigms for treatment."
54,"INTRODUCTION: Mandibular micrognathism (MM) is an underdeveloped mandible 
resulting from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. 
Prior research focused mainly on the genetic determinants of mandibular 
retrognathism, not necessarily reflecting micrognathism, thus supporting the 
need to study MM. This study aimed to explore the inheritance pattern and 
identify the candidate genes involved in the development and familial 
transmission of MM.
METHODS: Diagnosing probands with MM was based on clinical and lateral 
cephalometric data. The pedigrees were drawn for 11 identified families, 5 of 
whom accepted to undergo detailed data and biospecimen collection. These 
families included 15 MM and 13 non-MM subjects over 2-3 generations. The 
procedure involved the withdrawal of 5 mL of blood. Genomic DNA was isolated 
from blood cells to investigate protein-coding regions via whole exome 
sequencing. Standardized filtering steps were employed, and candidate genes were 
identified.
RESULTS: Most of the pedigrees suggested a Mendelian inheritance pattern and 
segregated in an autosomal-dominant manner. One of the families, which also 
underwent biospecimen, displayed an X-linked inheritance pattern of the trait. 
Genetic screening disclosed 8 potentially novel genes (GLUD2, ADGRG4, ARSH, 
TGIF1, FGFR3, ZNF181, INTS7, and WNT6). None of the recognized exonic regions 
were previously reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Eight novel genes were identified in association with MM in the 
largest number of families reported to date. The genes were X-linked in 1 
family, a finding previously not observed in mandibular genetics."
55,"Targeting CD96 that originates in immune cells has shown potential for cancer 
therapy. However, the role of intrinsic CD96 in solid tumor cells remains 
unknown. Here, it is found that CD96 is frequently expressed in tumor cells from 
clinical breast cancer samples and is correlated with poor long-term prognosis 
in these patients. The CD96+ cancer cell subpopulations exhibit features of both 
breast cancer stem cells and chemoresistance. In vivo inhibition of cancer 
cell-intrinsic CD96 enhances the chemotherapeutic response in a patient-derived 
tumor xenograft model. Mechanistically, CD96 enhances mitochondrial fatty acid 
β-oxidation via the CD155-CD96-Src-Stat3-Opa1 pathway, which subsequently 
promotes chemoresistance in breast cancer stem cells. A previously unknown role 
is identified for tumor cell-intrinsic CD96 and an attractive target in 
improving the chemotherapeutic response."
56,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) deposited from 
disease-affected individuals could be a valuable donor cell source for 
generating disease-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, 
generation of iPSCs from the LCLs is still challenging, as yet no effective gene 
delivery strategy has been developed.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we reveal an effective gene delivery method 
specifically for LCLs. We found that LCLs appear to be refractory toward 
retroviral and lentiviral transduction. Consequently, lentiviral and retroviral 
transduction of OCT4, SOX2, KFL4 and c-MYC into LCLs does not elicit iPSC colony 
formation. Interestingly, however we found that transfection of 
oriP/EBNA-1-based episomal vectors by electroporation is an efficient gene 
delivery system into LCLs, enabling iPSC generation from LCLs. These iPSCs 
expressed pluripotency makers (OCT4, NANOG, SSEA4, SALL4) and could form 
embryoid bodies.
CONCLUSION: Our data show that electroporation is an effective gene delivery 
method with which LCLs can be efficiently reprogrammed into iPSCs."
57,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: mRNA-based protein expression technology has been 
used to express functional proteins. We have previously generated dopamine 
neurons from rat-embryo derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) through repeated 
transfection of synthetic transcription factor mRNA encoding dopamine-inducible 
genes. However, NPCs began to die approximately 10 d post-transfection. In this 
study, we examined a long-term transfection protocol that did not affect cell 
viability.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Experiments were performed in eight groups sorted according 
to the start date of mRNA transfection. mRNA was transfected into NPCs daily for 
21 d and live cell images of each group were recorded. NPCs which were 
differentiated for more than five days showed sustained gene expression and 
appreciable viability despite daily mRNA transfection for 21 d.
CONCLUSIONS: Repeated mRNA transfection requires cells with a sufficient 
differentiation period."
58,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women all 
over the world and new treatment options are urgent. ER stress in cancer cells 
results in apoptotic cell death, and it is being proposed as a new therapeutic 
target. SH003, a newly developed herbal medicine, has been reported to have 
anti-cancer effects. However, its molecular mechanism is not yet clearly 
defined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microarray was performed to check the differential gene 
expression patterns in various breast cancer cell lines. Cell viability was 
measured by MTT assays to detect cytotoxic effects. Annexin V-FITC and 7AAD 
staining, TUNEL assay and DCF-DA staining were analyzed by flow cytometry to 
evaluate apoptosis and ROS levels, respectively. Protein expression was examined 
in SH003-breast cancer cells using immunoblotting assays. The expression of 
C/EBP Homologous Protein (CHOP) mRNA was measured by real-time PCR. The effects 
of CHOP by SH003 treatment were investigated using transfection method.
RESULTS: Herein, we investigated the molecular mechanisms through which SH003 
causes apoptosis of human breast cancer cells. Both cell viability and apoptosis 
assays confirmed the SH003-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Meanwhile, 
SH003 altered the expression patterns of several genes in a variety of breast 
cancer cell lines. More specifically, it upregulated gene sets including the 
response to unfolded proteins, independently of the breast cancer cell subtype. 
In addition, SH003-induced apoptosis was due to an increase in ROS production 
and an activation of the ER stress-signaling pathway. Moreover, CHOP gene 
silencing blocked SH003-induced apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: SH003 causes apoptosis of breast cancer cells by upregulating ROS 
production and activating the ER stress-mediated pathway. Thus, our findings 
suggest that SH003 can be a potential therapeutic agent for breast cancer."
59,"BACKGROUND/AIM: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a rare malignancy 
characterized by proliferation of early T-cell precursors that replace normal 
hematopoietic cells. T-ALL cells carry non-random chromosome aberrations, fusion 
genes, and gene mutations, often of prognostic significance. We herein report 
the genetic findings in cells from a T-ALL patient.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow cells from a patient with T-ALL were examined 
using G-banding, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), RNA sequencing, 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Sanger sequencing, and 
fluorescence in situ hybridization.
RESULTS: G-banding revealed del(1)(p34), add(5)(q14), trisomy 8, and monosomy 21 
in the leukemic cells. aCGH detected the gross unbalances inferred from the 
karyotyping results, except that heterozygous loss of chromosome 21 did not 
include its distal part; 21q22.12-q22.3 was undeleted. In addition, aCGH 
detected a submicroscopic interstitial 7.56 Mbp deletion in the q arm of 
chromosome 19 from 19q13.2 to 19q13.33. RNA sequencing detected and 
RT-PCR/Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of two novel chimeras, 
MYCBP::EHD2 and RUNX1::ZNF780A. They were generated from rearrangements 
involving subbands 1p34.3 (MYCBP), 19q13.2 (ZNF780A), 19q13.33 (EHD2), and 
21q22.12 (RUNX1), i.e., at the breakpoints of chromosomal deletions.
CONCLUSION: The leukemic cells showed the heterozygous loss of many genes as 
well as the generation of MYCBP::EHD2 and RUNX1::ZNF780A chimeras. Because the 
partner genes in the chimeras were found at the breakpoints of the chromosomal 
deletions, we believe that both the heterozygous losses and the generation of 
the two chimeras occurred simultaneously, and that they were pathogenetically 
important."
60,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Cervical cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in 
women worldwide and it is a major cause of cancer-related deaths in developing 
countries. Despite the marked reduction observed in the rates of the disease as 
a result of screening programs, it is necessary to develop robust biomarkers 
that can detect the neoplastic progression early in HPV-related cervical 
lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed comparative mRNA sequencing from exfoliative 
cervical cytology samples from nine Korean women using the Illumina NovaSeq6000 
platform. Each pathological tissue was matched to the corresponding cytological 
sample. The pathologic diagnosis was scrutinized with ancillary 
immunohistochemistry and was considered a confirmative (endpoint) diagnosis. The 
pathological diagnoses consisted of three cases of chronic cervicitis, 2 
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs), 2 squamous cell carcinomas 
in situ (CIS), and 2 invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SQCCs), respectively. 
Using bioinformatic analyses, differentially expressed genes (DEGs; fold change 
≥1.5; p<0.05) were applied for Gene Ontology (GO), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 
(GSEA), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.
RESULTS: From a total of 55,882 genes, 438 DEGs were pinpointed; 282 genes were 
up-regulated and 156 genes down-regulated. These transcriptomic profiles were 
clearly divided into neoplastic (HSIL, CIS, and SQCC; ≥HSILs) and non-neoplastic 
lesions. The up-regulated DEGs were HIF-1a, EDN1, PIK3R3, PPP1CA and AKR1C1. GO, 
GSEA, and PPI network analyses showed marked associations with metabolism, 
proteolysis, or proteoglycan process pathways in cervical carcinogenesis.
CONCLUSION: The transcriptomic analysis using exfoliative cervical cells was 
more likely representative of its corresponding histopathological diagnosis, 
thus emphasizing its potential utility in clinical practice. This study provides 
comprehensive transcriptomic network analyses for robust biomarkers that might 
present a high potential risk of progression to cancer in the exfoliative 
cervical cytology; our findings support their clinical utility for improved 
cervical cancer screening."
61,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Several cases of concurrent reduction of expression of 
polycystin 1 (PKD1) and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2) that are contiguous 
in chromosome 16p13 have been previously reported. This study newly addresses 
the concurrent reduction of expression of PKD1, TSC2 and NTHL1, which is 
adjacent to TSC2 and is a tumor suppressor gene.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the mRNA expression levels of PKD1, TSC2, 
PKD2, TSC1 and NTHL1 in blood and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissues in a 
proband with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), tuberous 
sclerosis complex (TSC) and multiple pathologically diverse RCCs, including 
clear cell, papillary and chromophobe types. Additionally, we investigated 
germline variants in blood using whole exome sequencing (WES) in the proband and 
her four siblings.
RESULTS: mRNA expression levels of PKD1, TSC2 and NTHL1 were reduced in the 
proband's blood and RCCs, compared with control groups. WES identified one novel 
variant with amino acid changes in the PKD1 exon in the three subjects with 
ADPKD, including the proband. Moreover, two variants in the TSC2 intron specific 
to the proband were also identified.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we report a novel pathogenic variant in the PKD1 exon 
which likely led to ADPKD, and two variants in the TSC2 intron, which might have 
led to reduction in the expression of both TSC2 and NTHL1, consequently leading 
to TSC and multiple pathologically diverse RCCs."
62,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common types of cancer 
in men. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is currently the only biomarker used to 
screen for the risk of developing PCa. Because PSA tests may show false 
positives, identifying novel PCa-specific biomarkers would improve prediction 
and diagnosis at an early stage. Previously, we identified a number of 
genes/microRNAs (miRNAs) in prostate tissue as potential biomarkers of chronic 
prostatitis in a rat model of chemical-induced prostatitis. The current study 
aimed to evaluate their potential for use as translational, diagnostic markers 
in humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
analysis using pathologically clear (normal) or confirmed PCa tissue samples 
from the same patients (N=18 per group).
RESULTS: Levels (relative fold changes) of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) 
transcripts were significantly lower in PCa tissues, compared with clear 
tissues, in a paired t-test (p=0.0075). Although neural cell adhesion molecule 1 
(NCAM1) transcripts tended to be altered in PCa tissues, statistically 
insignificant differences were observed (p=0.0521). No statistically significant 
differences were observed for the other genes/miRNAs analyzed in PCa tissues due 
to a high degree of individual variance in expression.
CONCLUSION: Similar to the results previously observed in rats, changes in the 
levels of BMP7 and NCAM1 transcripts were evident in human PCa tissues, 
suggesting that these genes may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers during 
the early stages of PCa. Further studies are needed to determine the potential 
use of these molecules as biomarkers."
63,"BACKGROUND/AIM: There exists considerably large interpatient variability in 
pharmacokinetic exposure of high dose melphalan in multiple myeloma patients 
with hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. In this study, we aimed to 
evaluate the potential impacts of CYP3A4*1B (rs2940574) and CYP3A5*3 (rs776746) 
variations on pharmacokinetic properties of melphalan and clinical outcomes in 
multiple myeloma (MM) patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genotypes of CYP3A4*1B (rs2940574) and CYP3A5*3 (rs776746) 
were determined by validated gene-specific real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assays using 
DNA samples from 108 MM patients; plasma concentrations of melphalan at 
different time points were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
RESULTS: CYP3A4*1B/*1B and CYP3A5*3/*3 carriers appeared to have a short median 
progression-free survival time and a higher maximum melphalan plasma 
concentration than non-carriers [792 vs. over 950 days, p=0.08; 9.91 (2.67, 
34.03) vs. 8.66 (4.46, 17.61) mg/l, p=0.039].
CONCLUSION: CYP3A4*1B/*1B and CYP3A5*3/*3 variations might influence melphalan 
therapy in MM patients through yet-to-be-identified mechanisms."
64,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Cancer cells with high anchorage independence can survive and 
proliferate in the absence of adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Under 
anchorage-independent conditions, cancer cells adhere to each other and form 
aggregates to overcome various stresses. In this study, we investigated the 
cytomorphology and gene expression signatures of oral cancer cell aggregates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two oral cancer-derived cell lines, SAS and HSC-3 cells, 
were cultured in a low-attachment plate and their cytomorphologies were 
observed. The transcriptome between attached and detached SAS cells was examined 
using gene expression microarrays. Subsequently, gene enrichment analysis and 
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis were performed. Gene expression changes under 
attached, detached, and re-attached conditions were measured via RT-qPCR.
RESULTS: While SAS cells formed multiple round-shaped aggregates, HSC-3 cells, 
which had lower anchorage independence, did not form aggregates efficiently. 
Each SAS cell in the aggregate was linked by desmosomes and tight junctions. 
Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed 1,698 differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) between attached and detached SAS cells. The DEGs were associated 
with various functions and processes, including cell adhesion. Moreover, under 
the detached condition, the expression of some epithelial genes (DSC3, DSP, 
CLDN1 and OCLN) were up-regulated. The changes in both cytomorphology and 
epithelial gene expression under the detached condition overall returned to 
their original ones when cells re-attached.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest specific cytomorphological and gene expression 
changes in oral cancer cell aggregates. Our findings provide insights into the 
mechanisms underlying anchorage-independent oral cancer cell aggregation and 
reveal previously unknown potential diagnostic and therapeutic molecules."
65,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of bidirectional fecal microbial transplant 
(FMT) between male and female rats on methamphetamine (MA)-induced hyperthermia.
METHODS: FMT was performed between male and female rats prior to MA (10 mg/kg, 
sc) treatment. Core body temperature, plasma drug and norepinephrine (NE) levels 
were measured and compared between treatment groups. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 
bacterial communities between male and female rats was performed.
RESULTS: MA treatment resulted in significantly higher core body temperatures in 
male groups (control and FMT-treated) compared to MA-treated female groups 
(control and FMT-treated). Plasma concentrations of MA and amphetamine were 
higher in females than males. Whereas, plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels were 
not different between male and female rats 90 minutes after MA treatment. At the 
phyla level, the microbiome of male and female control rats were dominated by 
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Males had a higher relative abundance of 
Firmicutes and lower relative abundances of Bacteroidetes than females. The FMT 
procedure changed the recipient group towards their donor with males getting 
closer to their donors than females. In the control groups following MA 
treatment, Firmicutes increased and Bacteroides decreased in females and males. 
Conversely, in the FMT treatment groups following MA treatment, Firmicutes 
decreased while Bacteroidetes increased in females and males.
CONCLUSIONS: Although definite differences in the structure and diversity of the 
gut microbiome were observed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of bacterial 
communities between male and female rats, these differences do not seem to 
contribute to the sex-based differences in MA-induced hyperthermia."
66,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Squalene epoxidase (SQLE) is a key enzyme involved in 
cholesterol biosynthesis, but increasing evidence reveals that SQLE is 
abnormally expressed in some types of malignant tumors, and the underlying 
mechanism remains poorly understood.
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Bioinformatics analysis and RNA sequencing were applied 
to detect to differentially expressed genes in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC). MTT, colony formation, AnnexinV-FITC/PI, EdU, wound healing, transwell, 
western blot, qRT-PCR, IHC, F-actin, RNA-sequencing, dual-luciferase reporters 
and HE staining were evaluated to investigate the pharmacological effects and 
possible mechanisms of SQLE.
KEY RESULTS: SQLE expression was specifically elevated in HCC, correlating with 
poor clinical outcomes. SQLE significantly promoted HCC growth, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. 
Both RNA-seq and functional experiments revealed that the protumorigenic effect 
of SQLE on HCC is closely related to the activation of TGF-β/SMAD signaling, but 
interestingly, the stimulatory effect of SQLE on TGF-β/SMAD signaling and HCC 
development is critically dependent on STRAP. SQLE expression is well correlated 
with STRAP in HCC, and further, to amplify TGF-β/SMAD signaling, SQLE even 
transcriptionally increased STRAP gene expression mediated by AP-2α. Finally, as 
a chemical inhibitor of SQLE, NB-598 markedly inhibited HCC cell growth and 
tumor development.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Taken together, SQLE serves as a novel oncogene in 
HCC development by activating TGF-β/SMAD signaling, and targeting SQLE could be 
useful in drug development and therapy for HCC."
67,"The morphological transformation of adipogenic progenitors into mature 
adipocytes requires dissolution of actin cytoskeleton with loss of 
myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)/serum response factor (SRF) 
activity. Circadian clock confers temporal control in adipogenic 
differentiation, while the actin cytoskeleton-MRTF/SRF signaling transduces 
extracellular physical niche cues. Here, we define a novel circadian 
transcriptional control involved in actin cytoskeleton-MRTF/SRF signaling 
cascade that modulates beige fat thermogenic function. Key components of actin 
dynamic-MRTF/SRF pathway display circadian regulation in beige fat depot. The 
core clock regulator, brain and muscle arnt-like 1 (Bmal1), exerts direct 
transcriptional control of genes within the actin dynamic-MRTF/SRF cascade that 
impacts actin cytoskeleton organization and SRF activity. Employing beige 
fat-selective gene-targeting models together with pharmacological rescues, we 
further demonstrate that Bmal1 inhibits beige adipogenesis and thermogenic 
capacity in vivo via the MRTF/SRF pathway. Selective ablation of Bmal1 induces 
beigeing with improved glucose homeostasis, whereas its targeted overexpression 
attenuates thermogenic induction resulting in obesity. Collectively, our 
findings identify the clock-MRTF/SRF regulatory axis as an inhibitory mechanism 
of beige fat thermogenic recruitment with significant contribution to systemic 
metabolic homeostasis."
68,"Groundwater provides much of the world's potable water. Nevertheless, 
groundwater quality monitoring programmes often rely on a sporadic, slow, and 
narrowly focused combination of periodic manual sampling and laboratory 
analyses, such that some water quality deficiencies go undetected, or are 
detected too late to prevent adverse consequences. In an effort to address this 
shortcoming, we conducted enhanced monitoring of untreated groundwater quality 
over 12 months (February 2019-February 2020) in four shallow wells supplying 
potable water in Finland. We supplemented periodic manual sampling and 
laboratory analyses with (i) real-time online monitoring of physicochemical and 
hydrological parameters, (ii) analysis of stable water isotopes from groundwater 
and nearby surface waters, and (iii) microbial community analysis of groundwater 
via amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA. We also developed an 
early warning system (EWS) for detecting water quality anomalies by automating 
real-time online monitoring data collection, transfer, and analysis - using 
electrical conductivity (EC) and turbidity as indirect water quality indicators. 
Real-time online monitoring measurements were largely in fair agreement with 
periodic manual measurements, demonstrating their usefulness for monitoring 
water quality; and the findings of conventional monitoring, stable water 
isotopes, and microbial community analysis revealed indications of surface water 
intrusion and faecal contamination at some of the studied sites. With further 
advances in technology and affordability expected into the future, the 
supplementary methods used here could be more widely implemented to enhance 
groundwater quality monitoring - by contributing new insights and/or 
corroborating the findings of conventional analyses."
69,"Mixotrophs combine both autotrophic and heterotrophic cell structures, and their 
highly plastic nutritional modes can shape the structure of food web and affect 
the carbon sink capacity of aquatic ecosystems. As pH affects the growth of 
phytoplankton by altering the carbonate balance system, water acidification 
caused by environmental pollution and global climate change may affect the 
nutritional modes of mixotrophs and bring a serious environmental consequence. 
In this study, we cultured mixotrophic Ochromonas gloeopara under autotrophic, 
mixotrophic, and heterotrophic conditions at different pH levels to test the 
tendency of its nutritional model and the changes in photosynthetic carbon 
fixation capacity. Results showed that: (1) with decreasing pH, carbon uptake of 
Ochromonas through phagocytosis gradually replaced the carbon fixation of 
photosynthesis; (2) with increasing pH, Ochromonas grazing rate decreased, and 
the relative contribution of photosynthetic carbon fixation to total carbon 
acquisition increased for Ochromonas; (3) Ochromonas became more heterotrophic 
under water acidification, which was involved in the up-regulated expression of 
genes encoding key enzymes that regulate nutrient perception, movement ability, 
and cell repair. These findings suggested that acidification caused mixotrophic 
organisms to become more heterotrophic, which can change their functional role 
and weaken their carbon sink capacity."
70,"Algal extracellular organic matter (EOM) metabolites exert considerable impact 
on the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycles mediated by attached 
bacteria. Field investigations were conducted in two ponds to explore the 
relationship among EOM metabolites from Microcystis and Dolichospermum, 
co-occurring microbes, and nutrient recycling from April 2021 to December 2021. 
Microcystis blooms primarily produced more complex bound EOM (bEOM) metabolites 
with many amino acid components, which facilitated bacterial colonization and 
provided sufficient substrates for ammonification. Meanwhile, high abundances of 
dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium genes from co-occurring microbes 
such as Rhodobacter have demonstrated their strong N retention ability. 
Metabolic products of bEOM from Microcystis comprise a large number of organic 
acids that can solubilize non-bioavailable P. All these factors have 
collectively resulted in the increase of all fractions of N and P, except for 
nitrate (NO3--N) in the water column. In contrast, the EOM metabolite from 
Dolichospermum was simple, coupled with high abundance of functional genes of 
α-glucosidase, and produced small molecular substances fueling denitrification. 
The metabolic products of EOM from Dolichospermum include abundant N-containing 
substances dominated by heterocyclic substances, suggesting that the metabolic 
products of Dolichospermum are not conducive to N regeneration and retention. 
Therefore, the metabolic products of EOM from Microcystis triggered a shift in 
the attached microbial community and function toward C, N, and P recycling with 
close mutual coupling. Acquisition of N and P in Dolichospermum is dependent on 
itself based on N fixation and organic P hydrolysis capacity. This study 
provides a new understanding of the contribution of algal EOM to the nutrient 
cycle."
71,"The negative effects of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on biological nitrogen 
removal performance in wastewater treatment plants, are receiving increasing 
attention due to the widespread reporting of this issue. In this study, pomelo 
peel iron-loaded biochar (Fe-PBC) was added to an anammox bioreactor to 
alleviate the negative effects of PFOA. Results showed that the addition of 
Fe-PBC increased the ammonia and nitrite removal efficiencies from 77.7 ± 9.6 % 
and 79.5 ± 5.6 % to 94.45 ± 5.1 % and 95.9 ± 5.0 %, respectively. In addition, 
Fe-PBC promoted the removal of PFOA from wastewater, increasing the PFOA removal 
efficiency from 5.2 % to 29.2 ± 4.3 % from 100 to 200 days. The introduction of 
iron-loaded biochar into the anammox bioreactor increased the CO ratio by 
13.64 % by 150 days. In addition, a CO fitting peak was detected in the Fe-PBC, 
indicating that the Fe-PBC was loaded with microorganisms. Microbial community 
analysis showed a decrease in the relative abundances of Proteobacteria and 
Nitrospirae from 31 % and 3.4 % to 16.8 % and 0.9 %, respectively, while the 
relative abundance of Planctomycetes increased from 26.8 % to 44.1 %. 
Metagenomic analysis found that the functional genes hzsB and hdh increased from 
98,666 ± 11,400 and 3190 ± 460 to 119,333 ± 15,534 and 138,650 ± 11,233 copy 
numbers/MLSS. The increase in anammox biomass may be attributed to the presence 
of iron, an essential element for the synthesis of key anammox enzyme. 
Furthermore, iron was also associated with the enhanced extracellular electron 
transfer in the anammox system induced by Fe-PBC."
72,"PURPOSE: To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of AAV2-REP1 in 
choroideremia (CHM) patients, and to test a potential antisense oligonucleotide 
therapy for CHM.
METHODS: Design: Extended phase 1/2 clinical trial and laboratory investigation.
PARTICIPANTS: Five patients who received a single subfoveal injection of 
AAV2-REP1.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The long-term safety was evaluated by ophthalmic examination, 
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and fundus 
autofluorescence (FAF) for up to five years. Functional and structural changes 
were determined by different test modalities. Four antisense oligonucleotides 
(ASOs) were designed to treat the CHM c.1245-521A>G mutation which was present 
in two patients within this trial.
RESULTS: Subject P3 experienced a localized intraretinal immune response that 
resulted in a significant loss of preserved RPE. P4 experienced an exacerbation 
of peripheral retinoschisis. P2 had a constant ≥ 15-letter BCVA gain in the 
treated eye, while P5 had ≥ 15-letter BCVA improvement once in the untreated 
eye. The preserved FAF areas declined more rapidly in the treated eyes compared 
to the untreated eyes (P = 0.043). A customized 25-mer ASO recovered 83.2-95.0% 
of the normal RNA and 57.5% of the normal protein in fibroblasts from two trial 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Intra-retinal inflammation triggered by AAV2-REP1 subretinal 
injection stabilized after two years but resulted in permanent damage to the 
retinal structure. Long-term progression of the disease was seen in both treated 
and untreated eyes, casting doubt as to the effectiveness of this approach in 
late-stage CHM. Alternate approaches such as ASO may have a therapeutic effect 
in a subgroup of CHM patients."
73,"Osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease that results from the imbalance 
of homeostasis within the bone. Intra-bone homeostasis is dependent on a precise 
dynamic balance between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by 
mesenchymal lineage osteoblasts, which comprises a series of complex and highly 
standardized steps. Programmed cell death (PCD) (e.g., apoptosis, autophagy, 
ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis) is a cell death process that involves 
a cascade of gene expression events with tight structures. These events play a 
certain role in regulating bone metabolism by determining the fate of bone 
cells. Moreover, existing research has suggested that natural products derived 
from a wide variety of dietary components and medicinal plants modulate the PCDs 
based on different mechanisms, which show great potential for the prevention and 
treatment of osteoporosis, thus revealing the emergence of more acceptable 
complementary and alternative drugs with lower costs, fewer side effects and 
more long-term application. Accordingly, this review summarizes the common types 
of PCDs in the field of osteoporosis. Moreover, from the perspective of 
targeting PCDs, this review also discussed the roles of currently reported 
natural products in the treatment of osteoporosis and the involved mechanisms. 
Based on this, this review provides more insights into new molecular mechanisms 
of osteoporosis and provides a reference for developing more natural 
anti-osteoporosis drugs in the future."
74,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is great current interest in the potential application 
of DNA methylation alterations in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) as 
biomarkers of susceptibility, progression and treatment response in inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD). However, the intra-individual stability of PBL methylation 
in IBD has not been characterised. Here, we studied the long-term stability of 
all probes located on the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip array.
METHODS: We followed a cohort of 46 adult IBD patients (36 Crohn's disease (CD), 
10 ulcerative colitis (UC), median age 44 (IQR: 27-56), 50% female) that 
received standard care follow-up at the Amsterdam UMC. Paired PBL samples were 
collected at two time points with a median 7 (range: 2-9) years in between. 
Differential methylation and intra-class correlation (ICC) analyses were used to 
identify time-associated differences and temporally stable CpGs, respectively.
RESULTS: Around 60% of all EPIC array loci presented poor intra-individual 
stability (ICC <0.50); 78.114 (≈9%) showed good (ICC 0.75 - 0.89); and 41.274 
(≈5%) excellent (ICC ≥0.90) stability, between both measured time points. 
Focusing on previously identified consistently differentially methylated 
positions indicated that 22 CD-, 11 UC-, and 24 IBD-associated loci demonstrated 
high stability (ICC ≥0.75) over time; of these, we observed a marked stability 
of CpG loci associated to the HLA genes.
CONCLUSION: Our data provide insight into the long-term stability of the PBL DNA 
methylome within an IBD context, facilitating the selection of biologically 
relevant and robust IBD-associated epigenetic biomarkers with increased 
potential for independent validation. These data also have potential 
implications in understanding disease pathogenesis."
75,"Monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain (LC) crystalline inclusions within 
podocytes is a rare, poorly characterized entity. To provide more insight, we 
now present the first clinicopathologic series of LC crystalline podocytopathy 
(LCCP) encompassing 25 patients (68% male, median age 56 years). Most (80%) 
patients presented with proteinuria and chronic kidney disease, with nephrotic 
syndrome in 28%. Crystalline keratopathy and Fanconi syndrome were present in 
22% and 10%, respectively. The hematologic condition was monoclonal gammopathy 
of renal significance (MGRS) in 55% and multiple myeloma in 45%. The serum 
monoclonal immunoglobulin was IgG κappa in 86%. Histologically, 60% exhibited 
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), often collapsing. Ultrastructurally, 
podocyte LC crystals were numerous with variable effacement of foot processes. 
Crystals were also present in proximal tubular cells as light chain proximal 
tubulopathy (LCPT) in 80% and in interstitial histiocytes in 36%. Significantly, 
frozen-section immunofluorescence failed to reveal the LC composition of 
crystals in 88%, requiring paraffin-immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry, 
with identification of kappa LC in 87%. The LC variable gene segment, determined 
by mass spectrometry of glomeruli or bone marrow plasma cell sequencing, was 
IGKV1-33 in four and IGKV3-20 in one. Among 21 patients who received anti-plasma 
cell-directed chemotherapy, 50% achieved a kidney response, which depended on a 
deep hematologic response. After a median follow-up of 36 months, 26% progressed 
to kidney failure and 17% died. The mean kidney failure-free survival was 57.6 
months and was worse in those with FSGS. In sum, LCCP is rare, mostly associates 
with IgG κappa MGRS, and frequently has concurrent LCPT, although Fanconi 
syndrome is uncommon. Thus, paraffin-immunofluorescence and electron microscopy 
are essential to prevent misdiagnosis as primary FSGS since kidney survival 
depends on early diagnosis and subsequent clone-directed therapy."
76,"The aberrant expression of ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11) is believed 
related to tumor progression. However, few studies have reported the biological 
function and clinical importance of USP11 in kidney fibrosis. Here, we 
demonstrated USP11 was highly upregulated in the kidneys from patients with 
chronic kidney disease and correlated positively with fibrotic lesion but 
negatively with kidney function. Conditional USP11 deletion or pharmacologic 
inhibition with Mitoxantrone attenuated pathological lesions and improved kidney 
function in both hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN)- and folic acid (FA)-induced 
mouse models of kidney fibrosis. Mechanistically, by RNA sequencing, USP11 was 
found to be involved in nuclear gene transcription of the epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR). USP11 co-immunoprecipitated and co-stained with 
extra-nuclear EGFR, and deubiquitinated and protected EGFR from 
proteasome-dependent degradation. Genetic or pharmacological depletion of USP11 
facilitated EGFR degradation and abated augmentation of TGF-β1 and downstream 
signaling. This consequently alleviated the partial epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition, G2/M arrest and aberrant secretome of profibrogenic and 
proinflammatory factors in uric acid-stimulated tubular epithelial cells. 
Moreover, USP11 deletion had anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory kidney effects 
in the murine HN and FA models. Thus, our study provides evidence supporting 
USP11 as a promising target for minimizing kidney fibrosis and that inhibition 
of USP11 has potential to be an effective strategy for patients with chronic 
kidney disease."
77,"Riemerella anatipestifer is an important pathogen in waterfowl, and is generally 
multidrug resistant. This study assessed the current status of Riemerella 
anatipestifer antibiotic resistance and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs), 
compared the results of different detection methods, and evaluated a new method 
of studying the association between antibiotic resistance and ARGs in Riemerella 
anatipestifer. In this study, 51 strains of Riemerella anatipestifer were 
isolated from ducks on several farms, their resistance to 28 antibiotics was 
assessed, and the isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. The number 
of ARGs carried by Riemerella anatipestifer was predicted, compared, and 
analyzed, and the consistency between ARGs and antibiotic-resistance phenotypes 
was assessed. The potential for loss of resistance genes during the sequencing 
and assembly of genome-wide framework map was assessed, and a new ARG detection 
method was pilot tested. The 51 strains of Riemerella anatipestifer were 
multidrug resistant (MDR) and had high level of resistance to aminoglycosides, 
trimethoprim, lincosamides, polypeptides, and macrolides. Based on the 
genome-wide framework map of the 51 strains, 3 local databases of ABRicate 
software and 1 online database of CARD website were used to detect ARGs, and a 
mean of 4 to 5 ARGs were identified per isolate. Although the detection results 
differed according to the database used, the general performance was consistent. 
The online website detected more types of ARGs than the ABRicate software. The 
association between ARGs and antibiotic-resistance phenotypes was assessed, and 
the ermF gene was identified as a possible key ARGs regulating macrolide 
resistance of Riemerella anatipestifer. The method used to investigate and 
detect Riemerella anatipestifer ARGs was convenient and rapid, and had strong 
accuracy and pertinence. The ARGs detection method reported here combined the 
advantages of PCR and genome detection, and could greatly reduce workload and 
detect ARGs more precisely."
78,"OBJECTIVE: Joubert syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a distinctive 
hindbrain malformation called molar tooth sign, causing motor and cognitive 
impairments. More than 40 genes have been associated with Joubert syndrome. We 
aim to describe a group of Joubert syndrome patients clinically and genetically 
emphasizing organ involvement.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical information and molecular 
diagnosis data of 22 patients with Joubert syndrome from multiple facilities. 
Clinical exome or whole-exome sequencing were performed to identify causal 
variations in genes.
RESULTS: The most common variants were in the CPLANE1, CEP290, and TMEM67 genes, 
and other causative genes were AHI1, ARMC9, CEP41, CSPP1, HYLS1, KATNIP, 
KIAA0586, KIF7, RPGRIP1L, including some previously unreported variants in these 
genes. Multi-systemic organ involvement was observed in nine (40%) patients, 
with the eye being the most common, including Leber's congenital amaurosis, 
ptosis, and optic nerve coloboma. Portal hypertension and esophageal varices as 
liver and polycystic kidney disease and nephronophthisis as kidney involvement 
was encountered in our patients. The HYLS1 gene, which commonly causes 
hydrolethalus syndrome 1, was also associated with Joubert syndrome in one of 
our patients. A mild phenotype with hypophyseal hormone deficiencies without the 
classical molar tooth sign was observed with compound heterozygous and likely 
pathogenic variants not reported before in the KATNIP gene.
CONCLUSION: Some rare variants that display prominent genetic heterogeneity with 
variable severity are first reported in our patients. In our study of 22 Joubert 
syndrome patients, CPLANE1 is the most affected gene, and Joubert syndrome as a 
ciliopathy is possible without a classical molar tooth sign, like in the KATNIP 
gene-affected patients."
79,"Changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) influence stem cell fate. When hESCs 
were differentiated on a thin layer of Matrigel coated onto PDMS 
(Matrigel_PDMS), they exhibited a substantial increase in focal adhesion and 
focal adhesion-associated proteins compared with those cultured on Matrigel 
coated onto TCPS (Matrigel_TCPS), resulting in YAP/TEF1 activation and 
ultimately promoting the transcriptional activities of pancreatic endoderm 
(PE)-associated genes. Interestingly, YAP activation in PE cells was mediated 
through integrin α3-FAK-CDC42-PP1A signaling rather than the typical Hippo 
signaling pathway. Furthermore, pancreatic islet-like organoids (PIOs) generated 
on Matrigel_PDMS secreted more insulin than those generated from Matrigel_TCPS. 
Electron micrographs revealed differential Matrigel architectures depending on 
the underlying substrate, resulting in varying cell-matrix anchorage resistance 
levels. Accordingly, the high apparent stiffness of the unique mucus-like 
network structure of Matrigel_PDMS was the critical factor that directly 
upregulated focal adhesion, thereby leading to better maturation of the 
pancreatic development of hESCs in vitro."
80,"Dimethylated histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9me2) is a conserved heterochromatic mark 
catalyzed by SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION 3-9 HOMOLOG (SUVH) methyltransferases in 
plants. However, the mechanism underlying the locus specificity of SUVH enzymes 
has long been elusive. Here, we show that a conserved N-terminal motif is 
essential for SUVH6-mediated H3K9me2 deposition in planta. The SUVH6 N-terminal 
peptide can be recognized by the bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domain of the 
RNA- and chromatin-binding protein ANTI-SILENCING 1 (ASI1), which has been shown 
to function in a complex to confer gene expression regulation. Structural data 
indicate that a classic aromatic cage of ASI1-BAH domain specifically recognizes 
an arginine residue of SUVH6 through extensive hydrogen bonding interactions. A 
classic aromatic cage of ASI1 specifically recognizes an arginine residue of 
SUVH6 through extensive cation-π interactions, playing a key role in 
recognition. The SUVH6-ASI1 module confers locus-specific H3K9me2 deposition at 
most SUVH6 target loci and gives rise to distinct regulation of gene expression 
depending on the target loci, either conferring transcriptional silencing or 
posttranscriptional processing of mRNA. More importantly, such mechanism is 
conserved in multiple plant species, indicating a coordinated evolutionary 
process between SUVH6 and ASI1. In summary, our findings uncover a conserved 
mechanism for the locus specificity of H3K9 methylation in planta. These 
findings provide mechanistic insights into the delicate regulation of H3K9 
methylation homeostasis in plants."
81,"Regulatory networks as large and complex as those implicated in cell-fate choice 
are expected to exhibit intricate, very high-dimensional dynamics. Cell-fate 
choice, however, is a macroscopically simple process. Additionally, regulatory 
network models are almost always incomplete and/or inexact, and do not 
incorporate all the regulators and interactions that may be involved in 
cell-fate regulation. In spite of these issues, regulatory network models have 
proven to be incredibly effective tools for understanding cell-fate choice 
across contexts and for making useful predictions. Here, we show that minimal 
frustration-a feature of biological networks across contexts but not of random 
networks-can compel simple, low-dimensional steady-state behavior even in large 
and complex networks. Moreover, the steady-state behavior of minimally 
frustrated networks can be recapitulated by simpler networks such as those 
lacking many of the nodes and edges and those that treat multiple regulators as 
one. The present study provides a theoretical explanation for the success of 
network models in biology and for the challenges in network inference."
82,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a well-established research tool and is also maturing 
as a novel therapeutic approach. For the latter, microRNA-like off-target 
activity of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) remains as one of the main problems 
limiting RNAi drug development. In this communication, we report that 
replacement of a single internucleoside phosphodiester in the seed region 
(nucleotides 2 to 7) of the guide strand with an amide linkage suppressed the 
undesired microRNA-like off-target activity by at least an order of magnitude. 
For the specific siRNA targeting the PIK3CB gene, an amide modification between 
the third and fourth nucleotides of the guide strand showed the strongest 
enhancement of specificity (completely eliminated off-target silencing) while 
maintaining high on-target activity. These results are important because 
off-target activity is one of the main remaining roadblocks for RNA based drug 
development."
83,"Increased saturated fatty acid levels in membrane phospholipids have been 
implicated in the development of metabolic disease. Here, we tested the 
hypothesis that increased saturated fatty acid (SFA) content in cell membranes 
negatively impacts adipocyte insulin signaling. Pre-adipocyte cell models with 
elevated SFA levels in phospholipids were generated by disrupting the ADIPOR2 
locus, which resulted in a striking two-fold increase in SFA-containing 
phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines, which persisted in 
differentiated adipocytes. Similar changes in phospholipid composition were 
observed in white adipose tissues isolated from the ADIPOR2 knockout mice. The 
SFA levels in phospholipids could be further increased by treating 
ADIPOR2-deficient cells with palmitic acid and resulted in reduced membrane 
fluidity and endoplasmic reticulum stress in mouse and human pre-adipocytes. 
Strikingly, increased SFA levels in differentiated adipocyte phospholipids had 
no effect on adipocyte gene expression or insulin signaling in vitro. Similarly, 
increased adipocyte phospholipid saturation did not impair white adipose tissue 
function in vivo, even in mice fed a high saturated fat diet at 
thermoneutrality. We conclude that increasing SFA levels in adipocyte 
phospholipids is well tolerated and does not affect adipocyte insulin signaling 
in vitro and in vivo."
84,"OBJECTIVES: CYP2C9 gene polymorphic variants can decrease the effects of 
losartan, reducing active metabolite (E-3174) formation. Study aims to determine 
the influence of *2 (+430C>T; rs799853) and *3 (+1075A>C; rs1057910) CYP2C9 gene 
polymorphic variants on the hypotensive and uricosuric effect of losartan on 
patients with arterial hypertension.
METHODS: Eighty one patients with stage 1-2 arterial hypertension newly 
diagnosed with ABMP were enrolled in the study. Physicians started losartan 
treatment and then we measured urine concentration of E-3174/losartan to 
estimate CYP2C9 activity. After 3-month losartan treatment we compared 
effectiveness of the therapy with ABPM and plasma uric acid level between 
carriers of CYP2C9 *1/*1 and CYP2C9 gene polymorphic variants (*2 and *3).
RESULTS: Carriage of CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles reduced the hypotensive 
effect of losartan (p<0.001, OR=8.13 (95% CI, 2.75-23.97)). Analysis of the ABPM 
data revealed that blood pressure was significantly higher in patients with 
polymorphic genotypes. There was no significant difference in uric acid level in 
plasma and losartan and its metabolite concentration in urine between genotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Carriage of low function polymorphic variants of the CYP2C9 gene 
(*2 and *3) reduced the hypotensive effect of losartan according to ABPM and 
don't affect uric acid level in plasma and E-3174/losartan in urine."
85,"BACKGROUND: The etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is multifactorial. The most 
important challenge of research is the identification of potential biomarkers 
associated with AD pathogenesis that may significantly contribute to early 
diagnosis of the disease. We aim to explore an eventual association of the C677T 
and A1298C genetic polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene with AD risk in an Algerian 
population.
METHODS: This case-control study involved comparing a group of 106 patients that 
had developed AD to another group of 104 non-demented individuals. The MTHFR 
genotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP method. Additionally, the homocysteine 
level was evaluated.
RESULTS: Genotypes analysis did not show an association for both MTHFR677CT and 
677TT variants with AD risk (OR = 1.12; p = 0.66; OR = 1.76; p = 0.09) 
respectively. As expected, the 677CC wild type genotype showed a protective role 
against AD (OR = 0.52; p = 0.03). For 1298AC MTHFR variant, the distribution of 
different genotypes did not show a statistical significant difference between 
the two cohorts. However the silmutaneous carrier, CT/AC presented association 
with AD (OR = 5.96; p = 0.05). On the other hand, carrier-state of MTHFR T 
allele showed a relationship with AD (OR = 1.98; p = 0.02). Additionally, 
hyperhomocysteinemia seems to be a risk factor for AD (OR = 1.08; p = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Our exploration reveals that the silmutaneous carrier, CT/AC, 
carrier-state of MTHFR T allele, and hyperhomocysteinemia seem to be risk 
factors for AD."
86,"Synthetic communities grown in well-controlled conditions are an important tool 
to decipher the mechanisms driving community dynamics. However, replicate time 
series of synthetic human gut communities in chemostats are rare, and it is thus 
still an open question to what extent stochasticity impacts gut community 
dynamics. Here, we address this question with a synthetic human gut bacterial 
community using an automated fermentation system that allows for a larger number 
of biological replicates. We collected six biological replicates for a community 
initially consisting of five common gut bacterial species that fill different 
metabolic niches. After an initial 12 hours in batch mode, we switched to 
chemostat mode and observed the community to stabilize after 2-3 days. Community 
profiling with 16S rRNA resulted in high variability across replicate vessels 
and high technical variability, while the variability across replicates was 
significantly lower for flow cytometric data. Both techniques agree on the 
decrease in the abundance of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, accompanied by an 
initial increase in Blautia hydrogenotrophica. These changes occurred together 
with reproducible metabolic shifts, namely a fast depletion of glucose and 
trehalose concentration in batch followed by a decrease in formic acid and 
pyruvic acid concentrations within the first 12 hours after the switch to 
chemostat mode. In conclusion, the observed variability in the synthetic 
bacterial human gut community, as assessed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing, is 
largely due to technical variability. The low variability seen in HPLC and flow 
cytometry data suggests a highly deterministic system."
87,"The activity of neurons in the rodent hippocampus contributes to diverse 
behaviors, with the activity of ventral hippocampal neurons affecting behaviors 
related to anxiety and emotion regulation, and the activity of dorsal 
hippocampal neurons affecting performance in learning- and memory-related tasks. 
Hippocampal cells also express receptors for ovarian hormones, estrogen and 
progesterone, and are therefore affected by physiological fluctuations of those 
hormones that occur over the rodent estrous cycle. In this review, we discuss 
the effects of cycling ovarian hormones on hippocampal physiology. Starting with 
behavior, we explore the role of the estrous cycle in regulating 
hippocampus-dependent behaviors. We go on to detail the cellular mechanisms 
through which cycling estrogen and progesterone, through changes in the 
structural and functional properties of hippocampal neurons, may be eliciting 
these changes in behavior. Then, providing a basis for these cellular changes, 
we outline the epigenetic, chromatin regulatory mechanisms through which ovarian 
hormones, by binding to their receptors, can affect the regulation of behavior- 
and synaptic plasticity-related genes in hippocampal neurons. We also highlight 
an unconventional role that chromatin dynamics may have in regulating neuronal 
function across the estrous cycle, including in sex hormone-driven X chromosome 
plasticity and hormonally-induced epigenetic priming. Finally, we discuss 
directions for future studies and the translational value of the rodent estrous 
cycle for understanding the effects of the human menstrual cycle on hippocampal 
physiology and brain disease risk."
88,"Interrupting the embryonic ectoderm development (EED)-H3K27me3 interaction 
represents a promising strategy to allosterically inhibit polycomb repressive 
complex 2 (PRC2) for cancer therapy. In this work, we report the structure-based 
design of new triazolopyrimidine-based EED inhibitors, which structurally 
feature the electron-rich indole ring at the C8 position. Particularly, ZJH-16 
directly binds to EED (HTRF IC50 = 2.72 nM, BLI KD = 4.4 nM) and potently 
inhibits the growth of KARPAS422 and Pfeiffer cells. In both cells, ZJH-16 is 
selectively engaged with EED and reduces H3K27 trimethylation levels. ZJH-16 
inhibits the gene silencing function of PRC2 in KARPAS422 cells. ZJH-16 
possesses favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles with an excellent oral 
bioavailability (F = 94.7%). More importantly, ZJH-16 shows robust tumor 
regression in the KARPAS422 xenograft model after oral administration with the 
tumor growth inhibition reaching nearly 100%. The robust antitumor efficacy and 
favorable PK profiles of ZJH-16 warrant further advanced preclinical development 
for lymphoma treatment."
89,"IMPORTANCE: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood 
cancer. Hepatotoxic effects, including hyperbilirubinemia and elevated alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, are common 
during all phases of therapy and are linked to several chemotherapeutic agents, 
including asparaginase, mercaptopurine, and methotrexate.
OBJECTIVE: To determine which genetic variants were associated with 
hyperbilirubinemia and elevated ALT and AST levels in children, adolescents, and 
young adults treated for ALL.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective analysis of a multiethnic 
genome-wide association study was conducted between January 1, 2019, and April 
15, 2022, including patients treated as part of Children's Oncology Group (COG) 
trials with centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia, which accrued 
data from December 29, 2003, to January 21, 2011 (AALL0232), and from January 
22, 2007, to July 24, 2014 (AALL0434). Germline genotypes were interrogated 
using genome-wide arrays and imputed using a National Institutes of Health 
TOPMed Imputation server. Mixed-effects logistic regressions were used to 
account for multiple episodes for an individual patient. Genotype × treatment 
phase interaction was tested to uncover phase-specific genetic risk factors.
EXPOSURES: Total duration of multiagent protocol chemotherapy ranging from 2.5 
to 3.5 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4) hyperbilirubinemia of 
grade 3 or higher and elevated liver ALT and AST levels.
RESULTS: A total of 3557 participants were included in the analysis (2179 
[61.3%] male; median age, 11.1 [range, 1-30] years). Among 576 known variants 
associated with these liver function test results in the general population, 
UGT1A1 variant rs887829 and PNPLA3 variant rs738409 were associated with 
increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia (odds ratio [OR], 2.18 [95% CI, 1.89-2.53]; 
P = 6.7 × 10-27) and ALT and AST levels (OR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.15-1.40]; P = 3.7 × 
10-7), respectively, during treatment for ALL. Corresponding polygenic risk 
scores were associated with hepatotoxic effects across all therapy phases and 
were largely driven by UGT1A1 and PNPLA3 variants. Genome-wide association 
analysis revealed an age-specific variant near the CPT1A gene that was only 
associated with elevated ALT and AST levels among patients younger than 10 years 
(OR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.18-1.39]; P = 8.7 × 10-10).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest a strong genetic basis for 
interpatient variability in hyperbilirubinemia and aminotransferase level 
elevations during leukemia chemotherapy."
90,"BACKGROUND: Truncating variants in desmoplakin (DSPtv) are an important cause of 
arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy; however the genetic architecture and 
genotype-specific risk factors are incompletely understood. We evaluated 
phenotype, risk factors for ventricular arrhythmias, and underlying genetics of 
DSPtv cardiomyopathy.
METHODS: Individuals with DSPtv and any cardiac phenotype, and their 
gene-positive family members were included from multiple international centers. 
Clinical data and family history information were collected. Event-free survival 
from ventricular arrhythmia was assessed. Variant location was compared between 
cases and controls, and literature review of reported DSPtv performed.
RESULTS: There were 98 probands and 72 family members (mean age at diagnosis 
43±8 years, 59% women) with a DSPtv, of which 146 were considered clinically 
affected. Ventricular arrhythmia (sudden cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular 
tachycardia, appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy) 
occurred in 56 (33%) individuals. DSPtv location and proband status were 
independent risk factors for ventricular arrhythmia. Further, gene region was 
important with variants in cases (cohort n=98; Clinvar n=167) more likely to 
occur in the regions, resulting in nonsense mediated decay of both major DSP 
isoforms, compared with n=124 gnomAD control variants (148 [83.6%] versus 29 
[16.4%]; P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: In the largest series of individuals with DSPtv, we demonstrate 
that variant location is a novel risk factor for ventricular arrhythmia, can 
inform variant interpretation, and provide critical insights to allow for 
precision-based clinical management."
91,"PURPOSE: Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a severe, recurrent allergic 
conjunctivitis. Previously, we found high concentrations of oncostatin M (OSM) 
in the tears of patients with VKC. Here, we investigated the role of OSM in VKC 
by focusing on epithelial barrier function and IL-33 production.
METHODS: To assess the effect of OSM on the barrier function of human 
conjunctival epithelial cells (HConEpiCs), we measured transepithelial 
electrical resistance and dextran permeability. We also assessed expression of 
tight junction-related proteins such as E-cadherin and ZO-1 in HConEpiCs by 
Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Then we used immunohistochemistry to 
evaluate expression of Ki-67, E-cadherin, epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition-related proteins, and IL-33 in giant papillae (GPs) from patients 
with VKC. In addition, we used Western blotting, microarray, quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to 
examine whether OSM activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 
(STAT1) or STAT3 and induces the expression of various genes in human 
conjunctival fibroblasts (HConFs).
RESULTS: OSM reduced expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1 in HConEpiCs, indicating 
barrier dysfunction. In immunohistochemistry, Ki-67 expression was present in 
the lower epithelial layer of the GPs, and E-cadherin expression was reduced in 
the superficial and lower layers; double staining revealed that GPs had a high 
number of fibroblasts expressing IL-33. In addition, in HConFs, OSM 
phosphorylated both STAT1 and STAT3 and induced IL-33.
CONCLUSIONS: OSM has important roles in severe, prolonged allergic inflammation 
by inducing epithelial barrier dysfunction and IL-33 production by conjunctival 
fibroblasts."
92,"BACKGROUND: Deciphering hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) pathogenesis is 
confounded by its genetic heterogeneity and oligogenic underpinnings.
METHODS: Whole genome sequences were analyzed by 3 independent strategies to 
identify HLHS gene candidates, ranked by variant, gene, and disease-level 
metrics.
RESULTS: First, a genome-wide association study of 174 cases and 853 controls 
revealed suggestive association with a MYO18B intron 33 variant (rs2269628-G; 
frequency=0.55 versus 0.39; OR, 1.97 [95% CI, 1.54-2.52]; P=6.70×10-8). Second, 
transmission disequilibrium testing of 161 HLHS proband-parent trios revealed 
overrepresentation of a MYO18B intron 42 variant (rs73154186-A; frequency=0.05; 
OR, 24 [95% CI, 3.2-177.4]; P=4.23×10-6). Third, rare, predicted-damaging 
variants were filtered in 2 multiplex families. In 141H, two-fifth-degree 
relatives with HLHS shared a paternally-inherited MYO5A missense variant 
(p.Arg801Trp; frequency=0.00003; combined annotation-dependent depletion 
score=29), each with a maternally-inherited or de novo candidate modifier 
variant in a MYO5A-interacting conventional myosin. In 442H, a HLHS proband was 
compound heterozygous for MYO15A variants-a maternally-inherited pathogenic 
stop-gain variant co-segregating with tetralogy of Fallot and bicuspid aortic 
valve in maternal relatives (p.Tyr2819Ter; frequency=0.00003) and a 
paternally-inherited intronic variant altering a canonical transcription factor 
binding site (rs1277068603; frequency=0.00001; position weight matrix 
score=0.98).
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings suggest that common and rare alleles 
within unconventional myosin genes are associated with HLHS susceptibility. The 
identified candidate MYO18B regulates cardiac sarcomerogenesis, supporting the 
hypothesis of intrinsic myogenic perturbation in arrested left heart 
development."
93,"BACKGROUND: Absence of a dicrotic notch on finger photoplethysmography is an 
easily ascertainable and inexpensive trait that has been associated with age and 
prevalent cardiovascular disease. However, the trait exists along a continuum, 
and little is known about its genetic underpinnings or prognostic value for 
incident cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: In 169 787 participants in the UK Biobank, we identified absent 
dicrotic notch on photoplethysmography and created a novel continuous trait 
reflecting notch smoothness using machine learning. Next, we determined the 
heritability, genetic basis, polygenic risk, and clinical relations for the 
binary absent notch trait and the newly derived continuous notch smoothness 
trait.
RESULTS: Heritability of the continuous notch smoothness trait was 7.5%, 
compared with 5.6% for the binary absent notch trait. A genome-wide association 
study of notch smoothness identified 15 significant loci, implicating genes 
including NT5C2 (P=1.2×10-26), IGFBP3 (P=4.8×10-18), and PHACTR1 (P=1.4×10-13), 
compared with 6 loci for the binary absent notch trait. Notch smoothness 
stratified risk of incident myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease, 
stroke, heart failure, and aortic stenosis. A polygenic risk score for notch 
smoothness was associated with incident cardiovascular disease and all-cause 
death in UK Biobank participants without available photoplethysmography data.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that a machine learning derived continuous trait 
reflecting dicrotic notch smoothness on photoplethysmography was heritable and 
associated with genes involved in vascular stiffness. Greater notch smoothness 
was associated with greater risk of incident cardiovascular disease. Raw digital 
phenotyping may identify individuals at risk for disease via specific genetic 
pathways."
94,"BACKGROUND: Ezrin, known as a crosslinker between the plasma membrane and actin 
cytoskeleton, is closely associated with breast cancer (BC) progression. Here, 
we explored a novel role of ezrin in breast cancer liver metastasis (BCLM).
METHODS: The clinical relevance of ezrin was evaluated using in silico tools and 
confirmed in BC specimens. The effect of ezrin on proliferation, migration and 
invasion was examined in vitro and in vivo using murine primary liver-metastatic 
breast cancer cells (mLM). The molecular mechanism involved in ezrin-mediated 
activation of the Notch1 signaling pathway was elucidated using in vitro models.
RESULTS: Data-mining demonstrated that ezrin mRNA and protein expression is 
up-regulated in breast cancer cohorts and has prognostic significance. Ezrin 
overexpression promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and 
in vivo. Hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) is one of the most significantly 
enriched candidates of differentially expressed genes in ezrin overexpression 
and control mLM cells. Ezrin can positively regulate Hes1 mRNA and protein 
expression, and their coexpression was associated with poor prognosis in BC 
patients. Ezrin promoted BC cell proliferation in a Hes1-dependent manner 
without directly interacting with Hes1. The functional link between ezrin and 
Hes1 is dependent on Notch1 activation through promotion of furin-like 
convertase cleavage.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that ezrin drives BCLM through activation 
of the Notch signaling pathway via furin-like convertase. These findings provide 
a better understanding of the mechanism of ezrin in breast cancer progression, 
with the goal of discovering a novel target for the treatment of BCLM in the 
future."
95,"Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria often develop biofilm through different 
mechanisms in promoting pathogenicity. Hence, the antibiofilm molecule needs to 
be examined separately on both organisms to manage the biofilm threat. Since the 
antibiofilm activity of piperine against Staphylococcus aureus was already 
reported; here, we aimed to examine the antibiofilm activity of it against 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen 
that can cause several healthcare-associated infections by exploiting biofilm. 
Several experiments like crystal violet assay, estimation of total protein, 
measurement of extracellular polymeric substance, and microscopic analysis 
confirmed that lower concentrations (8 and 16 µg/mL) of piperine could inhibit 
the microbial biofilm formation considerably. Besides, it could also reduce the 
secretion of virulence factors from P. aeruginosa. Further investigation showed 
that the cell surface hydrophobicity and microbial motility of the test organism 
got reduced under the influence of piperine. Piperine exposure was found to 
increase the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that resulted in the 
inhibition of biofilm formation. Furthermore, the molecular simulation studies 
suggested that piperine could affect the quorum sensing network of P. 
aeruginosa. Towards this direction, we noticed that piperine treatment could 
decrease the expression of the quorum sensing gene (lasI) that resulted in the 
inhibition of biofilm formation. Besides biofilm inhibition, piperine was also 
found to disintegrate the pre-existing biofilm of P. aeruginosa without showing 
any antimicrobial property to the test organism. Thus, piperine could be used 
for the sustainable protection of public-healthcare by compromising the biofilm 
assembly of P. aeruginosa."
96,"Whole exome sequencing (WES) has been used to detect rare causative variants in 
neurological diseases. However, the efficacy of WES in genetic diagnosis of 
clinically heterogeneous familial stroke remains inconclusive. We prospectively 
searched for disease-causing variants in unrelated probands with defined 
familial stroke by candidate gene/hotspot screening and/or WES, depending on 
stroke subtypes and neuroimaging features at a referral center. The clinical 
significance of each variant was determined according to the American College of 
Medical Genetics guidelines. Among 161 probands (mean age at onset 53.2 ± 13.7 
years; male 63.4%), 33 participants (20.5%) had been identified with 19 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (PVs; WES applied 152/161 = 94.4%). Across 
subtypes, the highest hit rate (HR) was intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH, 
7/18 = 38.9%), particularly with the etiological subtype of structural 
vasculopathy (4/4 = 100%, PVs in ENG, KRIT1, PKD1, RNF213); followed by ischemic 
small vessel disease (SVD, 15/48 = 31.3%; PVs in NOTCH3, HTRA1, HBB). In 
contrast, large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 4/44 = 9.1%) and cardioembolism 
(0/11 = 0%) had the lowest HR. NOTCH3 was the most common causative gene 
(16/161 = 9.9%), presenting with multiple subtypes of SVD (n = 13), ICH (n = 2), 
or LAA (n = 1). Importantly, we disclosed two previously unreported PVs, KRIT1 
p.E379* in a familial cerebral cavernous malformation, and F2 p.F382L in a 
familial cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The contribution of monogenic 
etiologies was particularly high in familial ICH and SVD subtypes in our 
Taiwanese cohort. Utilizing subtype-guided hotspot screening and/or subsequent 
WES, we unraveled monogenic causes in 20.5% familial stroke probands, including 
1.2% novel PVs. Genetic diagnosis may enable early diagnosis, management and 
lifestyle modification. Among 161 familial stroke probands, 33 (20.5%) had been 
identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic monogenic variants related to stroke. 
The positive hit rate among all subtypes was high in intracerebral hemorrhage 
(ICH) and ischemic small vessel disease (SVD). Notably, two previously 
unreported variants, KRIT1 p.E379* in a familial cerebral cavernous malformation 
and F2 p.F382L in familial cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, were disclosed. CVT 
cerebral venous thrombosis; HTN Hypertensive subtype; LAA large artery 
atherosclerosis; SV structural vasculopathy; U Undetermined."
97,"BACKGROUND: The basidiomycete fungus, Ganoderma boninense is the main 
contributor to oil palm Basal Stem Rot (BSR) in Malaysia and Indonesia. 
Lanosterol 14α-Demethylase (ERG11) is a key enzyme involved in biosynthesis of 
ergosterol, which is an important component in the fungal cell membrane. The 
Azole group fungicides are effective against pathogenic fungi including G. 
boninense by inhibiting the ERG11 activity. However, the work on molecular 
characterization of G. boninense ERG11 is still unavailable today.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study aimed to isolate and characterize the 
full-length cDNA encoding ERG11 from G. boninense. The G. boninense ERG11 gene 
expression during interaction with oil palm was also studied. A full-length 
1860 bp cDNA encoding ERG11 was successfully isolated from G. boninense. The G. 
boninense ERG11 shared 91% similarity to ERG11 from other basidiomycete fungi. 
The protein structure homology modeling of GbERG11 was analyzed using the 
SWISS-MODEL workspace. Southern blot and genome data analyses showed that there 
is only a single copy of ERG11 gene in the G. boninense genome. Based on the 
in-vitro inoculation study, the ERG11 gene expression in G. boninense has shown 
almost 2-fold upregulation with the presence of oil palm.
CONCLUSION: This study provided molecular information and characterization study 
on the G. boninense ERG11 and this knowledge could be used to design effective 
control measures to tackle the BSR disease of oil palm."
98,"Oxidative stress plays a key part in cardiovascular event. Growth 
arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6) is a vitamin K-dependent ligand which has been 
shown to exert important effects in heart. The effects of GAS6 were evaluated 
against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) ‑induced oxidative stress injury in HL-1 
cardiomyocytes. A series of experimental methods were used to analyze the 
effects of GAS6 on cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial 
function and AMPK/ACC signaling in H2O2‑injured HL-1 cells. In this study, we 
found that H2O2 reduced cell viability, increased apoptotic rate and 
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Meanwhile, H2O2 decreased the 
protein levels of GAS6, and increased the protein level of p-AMPK/AMPK, 
p-ACC/ACC. Then, we observed that overexpression of GAS6 significantly reduced 
cell death, manifested as increased cell viability, improved oxidative stress, 
apoptosis and upregulated the levels of GAS6, p-Axl/Axl, Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1, 
Bcl-2/Bax, PGC-1α, NRF1, TFAM, p-AMPK/AMPK, and p-ACC/ACC-related protein 
expression in HL-1 cells and H2O2‑injured cardiomyocytes. To further verify the 
results, we successfully constructed GAS6 lentiviral vectors, and found GAS6 
shRNA partially reversed the above results. These data suggest that AMPK/ACC may 
be a downstream effector molecule in the antioxidant action of GAS6. In summary, 
our findings indicate that activation GAS6/Axl-AMPK signaling protects 
H2O2‑induced oxidative stress which is accompanied by the amelioration of 
oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial function."
99,"BACKGROUND: Low-temperature expression of recombinant proteins may be 
advantageous to support their proper folding and preserve bioactivity. The 
generation of expression vectors regulated under cold conditions can improve the 
expression of some target proteins that are difficult to express in different 
expression systems. The cspA encodes the major cold-shock protein from 
Escherichia coli (CspA). The promoter of cspA has been widely used to develop 
cold shock-inducible expression platforms in E. coli. Moreover, it is often 
necessary to employ expression systems other than bacteria, particularly when 
recombinant proteins require complex post-translational modifications. 
Currently, there are no commercial platforms available for expressing target 
genes by cold shock in eukaryotic cells. Consequently, genetic elements that 
respond to cold shock offer the possibility of developing novel cold-inducible 
expression platforms, particularly suitable for yeasts, and mammalian cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This review covers the importance of the cellular response to low 
temperatures and the prospective use of cold-sensitive promoters to direct the 
expression of recombinant proteins. This concept may contribute to renewing 
interest in applying white technologies to produce recombinant proteins that are 
difficult to express."
100,"The yellow colour of ornamental varieties of tree peony originated from Paeonia 
delavayi. However, but P. delavayi and Paeonia suffruticosa belong to different 
subgroups, so hybridization is difficult and results in a long breeding cycle. 
However, no comprehensive transcriptomic profiling has focused on the colour 
formation mechanisms of yellow tree peony petals. Analysing the colour formation 
mechanism of yellow petals in P. delavayi is very important for directional 
molecular breeding. In this study, the transcriptional map of yellow pigment 
development in petals was used to analyse the mechanism of petal colour 
formation. We analysed the genes related to the metabolism of flavonoids and 
carotenoids and the transcription factors (TFs) involved in P. delavayi var. 
lutea (pure yellow individual) yellow pigment development using transcriptome 
sequence profiling. Transcriptome sequence profiles revealed three and four 
differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) involved in flavonoid biosynthesis 
and carotenoid biosynthesis, respectively. An analysis of DETs in the flavonoid 
pathway showed that chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone 2´-glucosyltransferases 
(THC2'GT) act in synergy to synthesize isosalipurposide (ISP). CHS and flavonol 
synthase (FLS) synergistically synthesize quercetin and kaempferol. DEG analysis 
of the carotenoid pathway revealed that phytoene synthase (PSY), carotenoid 
isomerase (CRTISO) and β-carotene hydroxylases (CHYB) play a key role in 
regulating lutein formation, and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase (CCD) plays an 
important role in the degradation of carotenoids. These two pathways may be 
regulated by TF families such as bHLH, ARF, and MYB. The results of the 
transient overexpression of genes showed that CHS and CHI are regulated by 
PdMYB2. In this study, the molecular mechanism of ISP synthesis was analysed in 
depth, and the complete metabolic pathway of carotenoids in Paeonia L. was 
reported for the first time. By studying the formation mechanism of yellow 
pigment in P. delavayi petals, a breeding strategy for improving flavonol and 
carotenoid contents and reducing anthocyanin synthesis by genetic engineering 
was suggested."
101,"Older adults have diminished immune responses that increase susceptibility to 
infectious diseases, such as influenza (flu). In older adults, flu infection can 
lead to hospitalization, catastrophic disability, and mortality. We previously 
demonstrated severe and prolonged muscle degradation and atrophy in aged mice 
during flu infection. Here, we utilized an unbiased transcriptomic analysis to 
elucidate mechanisms of flu-induced muscular declines in a mouse model. Our 
results showed age-related gene expression differences including downregulation 
of genes associated with muscle regeneration and organization and upregulation 
of genes associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and migratory immune 
pathways in aged mice when compared to young. Pathway analysis revealed 
significant enrichment of leukocyte migration and T cell activation pathways in 
the aged muscle during infection. Intramuscular CD4 T cells increased in both 
young and aged mice during infection, while intramuscular CD8 T cells increased 
exclusively in aged muscle. CD4 T cells in young muscle were regulatory T cells 
(Treg), while those in aged were T follicular helper (Tfh) and Th2 cells. 
Correspondingly, IL-33, an important cytokine for Treg accumulation within 
tissue, increased only in young flu-infected muscle. Conversely, CXCL10 (IP-10) 
increased only in aged muscle suggesting a continued recruitment of CD8 T cells 
into the aged muscle during flu infection. Overall, our findings elucidate a 
link between flu-induced disability and dysregulated intracellular T cell 
recruitment into flu-injured muscle with aging. Furthermore, we uncovered 
potential pathways involved that can be targeted to develop preventative and 
therapeutic interventions to avert disability and maintain independence 
following infection."
102,"Silent information regulator (SIRT) has distinctive enzymatic activities and 
physiological functions to control cell-cycle progression, gene expression, and 
DNA stability by targeting histone and non-histone proteins. SIRT1 enhances 
synaptic formation and synaptic activity, and therefore, can reduce the 
progression of various degenerative brain diseases including Parkinson's disease 
(PD). SIRT1 activity is decreased by aging with a subsequent increased risk for 
the development of degenerative brain diseases. Inhibition of SIRT1 promotes 
inflammatory reactions since SIRT1 inhibits transcription of nuclear factor 
kappa B (NF-κB) which also inhibits SIRT1 activation via activation of microRNA 
and miR-34a which reduce NAD synthesis. SIRT1 is highly expressed in microglia 
as well as neurons, and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. 
Therefore, this review aimed to find the possible role of SIRT1 in PD 
neuropathology. SIRT1 has neuroprotective effects; therefore, downregulation of 
SIRT1 during aging promotes p53 expression and may increase the vulnerability of 
neuronal cell deaths. PD neuropathology is linked with the sequence of 
inflammatory changes and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to the 
activation of inflammatory signaling pathways. In addition, oxidative stress, 
inflammatory disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis contribute 
mutually to PD neuropathology. Thus, SIRT1 and SIRT1 activators play a crucial 
role in the mitigation of PD neuropathology through the amelioration of 
oxidative stress, inflammatory disorders, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, 
and inflammatory signaling pathways."
103,"Esophageal dysmotility in esophageal atresia (EA) relates to abnormal 
development of esophageal innervation and musculature and to the esophageal 
repair. Few studies have investigated the preexisting dysmotility in EA, present 
prior to surgery. This systematic review aims to summarize the literature on 
neuronal studies in EA, to understand the causative factors for esophageal 
dysmotility. We performed a systematic review (PubMed, EMBASE, EBM, CINAHL 
databases; January 1947-February 2021) in accordance with PRISMA (PROSPERO 
number CRD42020171014). Fourteen studies were identified (eleven human, 187 EA 
patients; three animal, 64 EA rat specimens). Neural factors affecting 
esophageal dysmotility in human and animal studies included proteins, enzymes, 
growth factors, and genes, which play a role in the nervous system or 
neuroendocrine system, some of which have functions as neuromodulators or 
neurotransmitters. This systematic review has identified neural factors that 
affect esophageal dysmotility and contributes toward our understanding of the 
underlying dysmotility in patients with EA. The studies identified are important 
and essential for successful translation of basic science knowledge to impact 
clinical practice and understanding. Level of evidence: III."
104,"BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with circadian disturbances in which 
melanopsin was a key mechanism. Further studies have demonstrated that 
melanopsin gene variations are associated with some depressive disorders and 
aberrant light can impair mood through melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion 
cells (mRGCs). The goal of this study was to explore the direct relationship 
between depression and melanopsin.
METHODS: Adult C57BL/6 male mice were physically restrained for 16 h in a 50-ml 
polypropylene centrifuge tube and all behavioral tests were performed after CRS 
treatment. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were used to detect 
melanopsin expression in the retina of C57BL/6 mice. And we observed the change 
of the electrophysiological function and release of glutamate of mRGCs.
RESULTS: The melanopsin expression upregulate in mRGCs of chronic restraint 
stress (CRS)-treating mice which exhibit depression-like behavior. The frequency 
of blue light-induced action potentials and light-induced glutamate release 
mediated by melanopsin also increase significantly. This change of melanopsin is 
mediated by the CRS-induced glucocorticoid.
CONCLUSIONS: CRS may induce the depression-like behavior in mice via 
glucocorticoid-melanopsin pathway. Our findings provide a novel mechanistic link 
between CRS-induced depression and melanopsin in mice."
105,"The objective of this study was to isolate Streptomyces sp. from north paddy 
soils of Iran and investigation and identification of the bioactive compounds by 
carrying out GC-MS analysis. Antimicrobial activity was investigated by well 
diffusion agar technique against the pathogenic microorganisms including 
Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Bacillus cereus 
ATCC 11778, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, 
Proteus mirabilis ATCC 43071. Based on the results of gene sequencing of gene 
16S rRNA and phylogenetic analysis, the isolated sample belongs to the genus 
Streptomyces with the highest degree of resemblance (99/87%) to the Streptomyces 
pactum strain ACT12. The isolate showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial 
activity against test microorganisms. This isolate showed maximum antibacterial 
activity against M. luteus (25 ± 0.5 mm) and the most resistant microorganism 
against antibacterial activity of this isolate was P. aeruginosa (9 ± 0.5 mm). 
The contact bioautography method was used to detect compounds that were 
responsible for antimicrobial activity and showed the active compounds with Rf 
values of 0.8-0.9. The identification of bioactive metabolites were performed 
using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-MS analysis of the 
extract showed the presence of 15 volatile compounds. The main compounds were 
Methyl-3-(3,5-ditertbutyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) (10.88%) and Dibutyl phthalate 
(8.34%) in comparison with other bioactive compounds. The results showed that 
north paddy soils of Iran are a rich source of microbial flora for the 
production of antimicrobial compounds and useful for antimicrobial compounds 
discovery from Streptomyces sp."
106,"The isomerases are a unique enzymatic class of enzymes that carry out a great 
diversity of chemical reactions at the intramolecular level. This class 
comprises about 300 members, most of which are involved in carbohydrate and 
terpenoid/polyketide metabolism. Along with oxidoreductases and translocases, 
isomerases are one of the classes with the highest ratio of paralogous enzymes. 
Due to its relatively small number of members, it is plausible to explore it in 
greater detail to identify specific cases of gene duplication. Here, we present 
an analysis at the level of individual isomerases and identify different members 
that seem to be involved in duplication events in prokaryotes. As was suggested 
in a previous study, there is no homogeneous distribution of paralogs, but 
rather they accumulate into a few subcategories, some of which differ between 
Archaea and Bacteria. As expected, the metabolic processes with more paralogous 
isomerases have to do with carbohydrate metabolism but also with RNA 
modification (a particular case involving an rRNA-modifying isomerase is 
thoroughly discussed and analyzed in detail). Overall, our findings suggest that 
the most common fate for paralogous enzymes is the retention of the original 
enzymatic function, either associated with a dosage effect or with differential 
expression in response to changing environments, followed by 
subfunctionalization and, to a much lesser degree, neofunctionalization, which 
is consistent with what has been reported elsewhere."
107,"Bacterial expression systems play an indispensable role in the biosynthesis of 
recombinant proteins. Different proteins and the tasks associated with them may 
require different systems. The purpose of this work is to make an expression 
vector that allows switching on and off the expression of the target gene during 
cell incubation. Several expression vectors for use in Escherichia coli cells 
were developed using elements of the luxR/luxI type quorum sensing system of 
psychrophilic bacterium Aliivibrio logei. These vectors contain A. logei luxR2 
and (optionally) luxI genes and LuxR2-regulated promoter, under the control of 
which a target gene is intended to be inserted. The synthesis of the target 
protein depends directly on the temperature: gene expression starts when the 
temperature drops to 22 °C and stops when it rises to 37 °C, which makes it 
possible to fix the desired amount of the target protein in the cell. At the 
same time, the expression of the target gene at a low temperature depends on the 
concentration of the autoinducer (L-homoserine N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-lactone, AI) in 
the culture medium in a wide range from 1 nM to 10 μM, which makes it possible 
to smoothly regulate the rate of target protein synthesis. Presence of luxI in 
the vector provides the possibility of autoinduction. Constructed expression 
vectors were tested with gfp, ardA, and ardB genes. At maximum, we obtained the 
target protein in an amount of up to 33% of the total cellular protein. KEY 
POINTS: • A. logei quorum sensing system elements were applied in new expression 
vectors • Expression of target gene is inducible at 22 °C and it is switched off 
at 37 °C • Target gene expression at 22 °C is tunable by use different AI 
concentrations."
108,"BACKGROUND: Caspases (CASPs) are the main executors of the apoptotic process. 
Studies to date have shown the role of caspase-8 (CASP8) and caspase-9 (CASP9) 
in carcinogenesis. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the 
associations between CASP9-rs4233532, CASP9-rs4646018, and CASP8- rs1045485 gene 
polymorphisms and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) susceptibility in an Iranian 
population-based study. Moreover, it was examined whether such the genotype of 
these polymorphisms is related with clinicopathological characteristics of NHL.
METHODS: 175 patients with NHL and 175 age- and sex-matched controls were 
enrolled in this study. We determined the genotypes of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) from CASP genes with Tetra ARMS-PCR (Amplification 
refractory mutation system) method.
RESULTS: Statistically significant association were observed between 
CASP9-rs4646018 and increased risk of NHL under codominant CC, codominant TC, 
and dominant TC+CC genetic models. Our results showed that the A allele of 
CASP8-rs1045485 was a protective factor for NHL and GArs1045485 genotype 
significantly reduced risk of NHL. In contrast, CASP9- rs4233532 was not linked 
to NHL susceptibility. No relationship was detected between CASP8-rs1045485 and 
CASP9-rs4233532 and NHL clinicopathological characteristics, however genetic 
variation in CASP9-rs4646018 was associated with histology, treatment and radio 
therapy of NHL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study presented that the CASP8- rs1045485 and CASP9-rs4646018 
polymorphisms could affect the risk of NHL in Iranian populations which was the 
first report to show the significant relationship between rs1045485, rs4646018 
polymorphisms and NHL susceptibility. Replication large-scale case-control 
studies in different ethnicities are warranted to verify these findings."
109,"BACKGROUND: Refining risk stratification of cytogenetically  normal AML (CN-AML) 
cases is important for decision making and tailoring of therapy. In this context 
genetic and epigenetic mutations was considered. Among these epigenetic 
regulators are DNMT3A & TET2 genes. Therefore, the aim of  this study was to 
determine the prevalence of DNMT3A and TET2 genes mutations and their impact on 
the outcome of  adult AML patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The present study is cross sectional study which was 
conducted on 39 adult CN-AML patients at diagnosis. For all included patients 
sanger sequencing was done for DNMT3A exon 23 and TET2 exon 3 genes.
RESULTS: DNMT3A mutations were detected in 8 of 39 patients (20.5%), and in 5 of 
39 patients(12.8%) in TET gene. Two CN-AML  patients had combined mutations in 
both genes. All of the mutations detected were missense and only one was frame 
shift. Mutated TET2 or DNMT3A genes were significantly associated with failure 
of complete remission (CR) (p <0.001), higher mortality rate, shorter OS 
(mean=16 versus 22.7 months) and shorter DFS (mean= 9.5 versus 21.4 months) when 
compared to non-mutated ones.
CONCLUSION: Mutated TET2 and DNMT3A detection define a subgroup of CN-AML 
patients with poor outcome."
110,"OBJECTIVE: ADH1B, ADH1C and ALDH2 genes are mainly responsible for alcohol 
metabolism in the body. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these 
genes have been reported to be associated with alcohol dependence and are 
considered risk factors for various human diseases. This study aims to identify 
the prevalence of three SNPs of ADH1B (rs1229984), ADH1C (rs698) and ALDH2 
(rs671) in 235 unrelated individuals living in Thai Nguyen province, the 
northeast region of Vietnam.
METHODS: The target genotypes were identified by using PCR direct sequencing, 
and their frequencies were compared to previous reports.
RESULT: Our data showed that allele frequencies of ADH1B*2, ADH1C*2 and ALDH2*2 
were 68.8%, 8.3% and 20.4%, respectively. The ADH1B*2 and ADH1C*2 frequencies 
were similar to those of the Kinh ethnic individuals living in the south region 
of Vietnam, while the ALDH2*2 frequency was higher. Compared to data from other 
countries, ADH1B*2 frequency is similar to the Philippines (60.5%) and Mongolia 
(62.9%) but significantly different from the other populations. The ADH1C*2 
frequency is not so different compared to Japanese (5.7%) and Chinese (7.1%) but 
is quite different in other populations. ALDH2*2 frequency was lower than 
Japanese (29.3%), Indonesian (30%) and higher than other countries. Regarding 
the risk of alcoholism, the percentage of Vietnamese people in this study with 
genotypes related to alcohol dependence is 8.1%. In contrast, the carrier has 
genotypes protecting against alcoholism with high frequency, 91.9%. Among them, 
the individuals can cause high acetaldehyde accumulation accounting for 33.2%.
CONCLUSION: This study helps to understand the genetic polymorphisms of alcohol 
metabolism genes in the community living in Thai Nguyen province, northeast of 
Vietnam, and provides valuable scientific data relating to alcohol consumption 
behavior as well as public health protection."
111,"BACKGROUND: CD44 is an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) surface receptor 
that regulates the interactivity between the cells and the extracellular matrix, 
thereby promoting cell migration. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
family is a trans-membrane kinase-related protein. It regulates cell adhesion 
proteins, which may promote cell proliferation and invasiveness. Mesenchymal 
epithelial transition (MET) is another EMT receptor that stimulates cell 
proliferation, invasion, survival, and angiogenesis. This study aimed to 
evaluate the prognostic impact of CD44, EGFR expressions, and MET gene 
amplification in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study, including 85 cases of EOC. CD44 
and EGFR expressions were evaluated in both epithelial and stromal cells by 
immunohistochemistry. Tumor cells also underwent a cytogenetic analysis using 
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect MET gene amplification.
RESULTS: High CD44 expression in tumors was significantly associated with serous 
subtypes (P=0.001), peritoneal deposits (P=0.002), and advanced stage (P=0.002). 
EGFR high tumor expression demonstrated a significant association with lymph 
node metastasis (P=0.038) and the advanced stage of EOC (P=0.016). Increased 
copy number of the MET gene was significantly associated with partial therapy 
response (P=0.030).  CD44 and EGFR tumor high expression was associated with 
poor overall survival (OS). In addition, MET gene gain in tumors was associated 
with a shorter OS (P=0.000).
CONCLUSION: EMT biomarkers (CD44 and MET) and EGFR expression in EOC are 
independent prognostic factors for OS. MET gene increase copy number was 
detected in cases of serous neoplasm and associated with poor survival and 
minimal therapy response."
112,"OBJECTIVE: The incidence of breast cancer continues to rise despite decades of 
laboratory, epidemiological and clinical research. Breast cancer is still the 
leading cause of cancer death in women. Cyclin D1 is one of the most important 
oncoproteins associated with cancer cell proliferation and is overexpressed in 
more than 50% of cases. Curcumin and chrysin are plant-derived components that 
are believed to assist in inhibiting the viability of breast cancer cells. These 
agents are involved in cancer cells' growth and reducing cyclin D1 expression. 
In this study, the hypothesis of combining curcumin and chrysin is applied to 
analyze the potential synergistic effect in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation 
and down-regulation of cyclin D1. Furthermore, applying PLGA-PEG NPs could 
improve the bioavailability of free curcumin and chrysin components and at the 
same time increases the anti-cancer potential of this compound.
METHODS: PLGA-PEG NPs were synthesized via the ring-opening polymerization 
technique and characterized with FT-IR and FE-SEM for chemical structure and 
morphological characteristics, respectively. Next, curcumin and chrysin were 
loaded in PLGA-PEG NPs and MTT assay was performed to assess the cytotoxic 
effect of these agents. T-47D cells were treated with appropriate concentrations 
of these agents and cyclin D1 expression level was evaluated by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: The obtained results from FT-IR and FE-SEM techniques illustrated that 
curcumin and chrysin were efficiently encapsulated into PLGA-PEG NPs. Curcumin, 
chrysin, and curcumin-chrysin in free and nano-encapsulated forms exhibited an 
anti-cancer effect on T-47D cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, 
especially in a combination of free and encapsulated forms demonstrated 
synergistic anti-cancer effects. Compared to free form, Nano-curcumin, 
Nano-chrysin, and Nano-combination remarkably down-regulated cyclin D1 gene 
expression. (p-value < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that the curcumin-chrysin combination has a 
synergistic effect and the encapsulated form of this nano-component has more 
inhibition on cyclin D1 expression.<br />."
113,"BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer (TC) is a common endocrine malignancy that frequently 
harbours the oncogenic V600E BRAF mutation. This mutation has received 
considerable attention in recent years for its potential utility in the risk 
stratification and management of TC. This study aims to investigate BRAF 
mutational status in thyroid cancer of Libyan patients and their association 
with clinicopathological factors.
METHODS: 44 thyroid tissue samples were analysed for mutations in exon 15 of the 
BRAF gene by performing polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. The 
results of BRAF mutation screening were correlated to clinical and pathological 
characteristics of the studied thyroid cancer patients. Statistical analyses 
were performed using SPSS.
RESULTS: The BRAF exon 15 mutations were detected in 19 (43.2%) of the thyroid 
cancer cases. The V600E was the most frequent one found in 15/44 (34.1%) cases. 
We also detected 6 other variants in 7 patients (15.9%), the S616F, the W619R 
and the T599S. Three mutations were associated with V600E, the L584I, the D587Y 
and the synonymous L597L. None of these mutations were reported previously in 
thyroid cancers. No statistical association was found between BRAF mutations and 
clinicopathological factors except with papillary thyroid cancer type (p= 
0,032).
CONCLUSIONS: Novel BRAF mutations and V600E were frequently detected in thyroid 
cancer of Libyan patients; this suggests a potential role of these novel 
mutations in carcinogenesis and in anti-EGFR therapy resistance."
114,"Salvia rosmarinus is considered a sacred plant because of its special fragrance 
and is commonly used in cooking and traditional medicine. Here, we report a 
high-quality chromosome-level assembly of the S. rosmarinus genome of 1.11 G in 
size; the genome has a scaffold N50 value of 95.5 Mb and contains 40,701 
protein-coding genes. In contrast to other diploid Labiatae, an independent 
whole genome duplication (WGD) event was shown by S. rosmarinus at approximately 
15 MYA. Transcriptomic comparison of two S. rosmarinus cultivars with 
contrasting carnosic acid (CA) content identified 842 genes significantly 
positively associated with carnosic acid biosynthesis in S. rosmarinus. Many of 
these genes have been reported to be involved in CA-biosynthesis previously, 
such as several MVA/MEP pathways and CYP71-coding genes. Based on the genomes 
and these genes, we propose a model of CA biosynthesis in S. rosmarinus. 
Further, comparative genome analysis of the congeneric species revealed the 
species-specific evolution of CA biosynthetic genes. The genes encoding 
diterpene synthase and the cytochromes P450 (CYPs) family of CA 
synthesis-associated genes form a biosynthetic gene cluster (CPSs-KSLs-CYP76AHs) 
responsible for the synthesis of leaf and root diterpenoids, which are located 
on S. rosmarinus chromosome 1 and 2, respectively. Such clustering is also 
observed in other sage plants, thus suggesting that genes involved in 
diterpenoid synthesis are conserved in the Labiataceae family. These findings 
provide new insights into the synthesis of aromatic terpenoids and their 
regulation."
115,"It is critical to use research methods to collect and regulate surface water to 
provide water while avoiding damage. Following accurate runoff prediction, 
principled planning for optimal runoff is implemented. In recent years, there 
has been an increase in the use of machine learning approaches to model 
rainfall-runoff. In this study, the accuracy of rainfall-runoff modeling 
approaches such as support vector machine (SVM), gene expression programming 
(GEP), wavelet-SVM (WSVM), and wavelet-GEP (WGEP) is evaluated. Python is used 
to run the simulation. The research area is the Yellow River Basin in central 
China, and in the west of the region, the Tang-Nai-Hai hydrometric station has 
been selected. The train state data ranges from 1950 to 2000, while the test 
state data ranges from 2000 to 2020. The analysis looks at two different types 
of rainy and non-rainy days. The WGEP simulation performed best, with a 
Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.98, while the WSVM, GEP, and SVM 
simulations performed poorly, with NSEs of 0.94, 0.89, and 0.77, respectively. 
As a result, combining hybrid methods with wavelet improved simulation accuracy, 
which is now the highest for the WGEP method."
116,"MOTIVATION: During disease progression or organism development, alternative 
splicing may lead to isoform switches that demonstrate similar temporal patterns 
and reflect the alternative splicing co-regulation of such genes. Tools for 
dynamic process analysis usually neglect alternative splicing.

data analysis. Spycone exploits a novel IS detection algorithm and offers 
downstream analysis such as network and gene set enrichment. We demonstrate the 
performance of Spycone using simulated and real-world data of SARS-CoV-2

117,"Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal that affects the normal growth and development of 
plants. Roots may directly contact Cd are thus serve as the first barrier in the 
defense responses of plants. In this study, Tamarix hispida roots treated with 
150 μM CdCl2 were collected for RNA-seq. A total of 2,004 DEGs were identified 
at different time points. KEGG enrichment revealed that the DEGs were 
significantly enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, 
and other metabolic pathways. To explore the regulatory role of transcription 
factors (TFs) involved in the Cd stress response, a multilayer hierarchical gene 
regulatory network (ML-hGRN) was constructed, including 53 TFs and 54 structural 
genes in ML-hGRN, with 341 predicted regulatory relationships. Binding of DRE1A, 
MYC1, FEZ, ERF4, and ERF17 to predicted target genes was detected by ChIP-PCR, 
and DRE1A, MYC1 and FEZ were transiently overexpressed in T. hispida. The 
results suggest that these TFs play a key role in the Cd stress response by 
scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS). In conclusion, this study predicts 
some Cd-responsive TFs that may have an important function under Cd stress and 
provides useful information for molecular breeding."
118,"Zearalenone (ZEN) is a secondary metabolite from Fusarium species. It is also 
present in plants and regulates the photochemical reaction in Photosystem II, 
the stress response, and root growth. To investigate the mechanism by which ZEN 
regulates Tetrastigma hemsleyanum root growth, differentially expressed 
microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified and verified by high-throughput sequencing 
and Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation of the roots of T. 
hemsleyanum seedlings treated with and without ZEN. The predicted functions of 
microRNA156b (miR156b) and microRNA156f (miR156f) were confirmed in transgenic 
hairy roots. (1) A total of 70 miRNAs showed significantly different expression 
levels under ZEN treatment, including seven highly conserved miRNAs. (2) The 
number of lateral roots and total root length of the transgenic hairy roots 
overexpressing miR156b and miR156f were significantly higher than the wild-type 
hairy roots, and thus, the overexpression of miR156b and miR156f in T. 
hemsleyanum promoted lateral root development. (3) Bioinformatics analysis 
predicted that the target genes of miR156b and miR156f were SPL9/10. As compared 
with the wild-type hairy roots, the expression of SPL9 was significantly lower 
in the hairy roots overexpressing miR156b, and the expression of SPL10 was 
significantly lower in the hairy roots overexpressing miR156f. Therefore, SPL9 
could be the target gene of miR156b, and SPL10 could be the target gene of 
miR156f. This study shows that ZEN could increase the expression of miR156b and 
miR156f in T. hemsleyanum roots, which negatively regulated the expression of 
their putative target genes SPL9 and SPL10, consequently promoting the growth 
and development of the lateral roots."

investigated the associations between TGFBR2, miR20a-5p and lncRNA LAMTOR5-AS1 
in CRC patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The colorectal cancer and adjacent normal tissue samples 
(n=34) were prepared from CRC patients. The associations between TGFBR2, 
miR20a-5p and lncRNA LAMTOR5-AS1 were predicted using bioinformatics tools. The 
expression levels of TGFBR2, miR20a-5p and lncRNA LAMTOR5-AS1 were measured 
using Quantitative Real-Time PCR technique. The TGFBR2 protein values were 
measured by western blotting method. The clinical importance of lncRNA 
LAMTOR5-AS1 was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
RESULTS: The up-regulated levels of TGFBR2 (P = 0.02), TGFBR2 protein (P = 
0.008) and lncRNA LAMTOR5-AS1 (P = 0.02) were significantly observed in CRC 
tissues as compared with the adjacent normal tissues. The miR20a-5p expression 
level (P = 0.009) was downregulated in CRC tissues. In addition, the miR20a-5p 
expression level was inversely correlated to the TGFBR2 gene (R² = 0.88, P 
<0.0001), protein (R² = 0.95, P <0.0001) and lncRNA LAMTOR5-AS1 gene (R² = 0.93, 
P <0.0001) expression levels. Based on the area under curve (AUC), the increase 
of lncRNA LAMTOR5-AS1 expression level with a sensitivity of 64.52 % and 
specificity of 65.52% was considered in CRC patients.
CONCLUSION: We suggested that the miR20a-5p is inversely related to lncRNA 
LAMTOR5-AS so that it may be involved in the regulation of TGFBR2 expression 
level in CRC patients."
120,"BACKGROUND: The extent of pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer 
remains controversial, and more high-level clinical evidence is needed. This 
study aimed to evaluate the outcome of extended pancreatoduodenectomy (EPD) with 
retroperitoneal nerve resection in pancreatic head cancer.
METHODS: This multicenter randomized trial was performed at 6 Chinese 
high-volume hospitals that enrolled patients between October 3, 2012, and 
September 21, 2017. Four hundred patients with stage I or II pancreatic head 
cancer and without specific pancreatic cancer treatments (preoperative 
chemotherapy or chemoradiation) within three months were randomly assigned to 
undergo standard pancreatoduodenectomy (SPD) or EPD, with the latter followed by 
dissection of additional lymph nodes (LNs), nerves and soft tissues 270° on the 
right side surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and celiac axis. The 
primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) by intention-to-treat (ITT). The 
secondary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS), mortality, morbidity, and 
postoperative pain intensity.
RESULTS: The R1 rate was slightly lower with EPD (8.46%) than with SPD (12.56%). 
The morbidity and mortality rates were similar between the two groups. The 
median OS was similar in the EPD and SPD groups by ITT in the whole study cohort 
(23.0 vs. 20.2 months, P = 0.100), while the median DFS was superior in the EPD 
group (16.1 vs. 13.2 months, P = 0.031). Patients with preoperative CA19-9 < 
200.0 U/mL had significantly improved OS and DFS with EPD (EPD vs. SPD, 30.8 vs. 
20.9 months, P = 0.009; 23.4 vs. 13.5 months, P < 0.001). The EPD group 
exhibited significantly lower locoregional (16.48% vs. 35.20%, P < 0.001) and 
mesenteric LN recurrence rates (3.98% vs. 10.06%, P = 0.022). The EPD group 
exhibited less back pain 6 months postoperation than the SPD group.
CONCLUSIONS: EPD for pancreatic head cancer did not significantly improve OS, 
but patients with EPD treatment had significantly improved DFS. In the subgroup 
analysis, improvements in both OS and DFS in the EPD arm were observed in 
patients with preoperative CA19-9 < 200.0 U/mL. EPD could be used as an 
effective surgical procedure for patients with pancreatic head cancer, 
especially those with preoperative CA19-9 < 200.0 U/mL."
121,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2). Though many 
methods have been used for detecting SARS-COV-2, development of an ultrafast and 
highly sensitive detection strategy to screen and/or diagnose suspected cases in 
the population, especially early-stage patients with low viral load, is 
significant for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. In this study, a novel 
restriction endonuclease-mediated reverse transcription multiple cross 
displacement amplification (MCDA) combined with real-time fluorescence analysis 
(rRT-MCDA) was successfully established and performed to diagnose COVID-19 
infection (COVID-19 rRT-MCDA). Two sets of specific SARS-COV-2 rRT-MCDA primers 
targeting opening reading frame 1a/b (ORF1ab) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes were 
designed and modified according to the reaction mechanism. The SARS-COV-2 
rRT-MCDA test was optimized and evaluated using various pathogens and clinical 
samples. The optimal reaction condition of SARS-COV-2 rRT-MCDA assay was 65°C 
for 36 min. The SARS-COV-2 rRT-MCDA limit of detection (LoD) was 6.8 copies per 
reaction. Meanwhile, the specificity of SARS-COV-2 rRT-MCDA assay was 100%, and 
there was no cross-reaction with nucleic acids of other pathogens. In addition, 
the whole detection process of SARS-COV-2 rRT-MCDA, containing the RNA template 
processing (15 min) and real-time amplification (36 min), can be accomplished 
within 1 hour. The SARS-COV-2 rRT-MCDA test established in the current report is 
a novel, ultrafast, ultrasensitive, and highly specific detection method, which 
can be performed as a valuable screening and/or diagnostic tool for COVID-19 in 
clinical application. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

122,"The intrinsic skeletal muscle core clock has emerged as a key feature of 
metabolic control and influences several aspects of muscle physiology. Acute 
alcohol intoxication disrupts the core molecular clock, but whether chronic 
consumption, like that leading to alcoholic myopathy, is also a zeitgeber for 
skeletal muscle remains unknown. The purpose of this work was to determine 
whether chronic alcohol consumption dysregulates the skeletal muscle core 
molecular clock and clock-controlled genes (CCGs). C57BL/6Hsd female mice (14 
weeks old) were fed a control (CON) or alcohol (EtOH) containing liquid diet for 
6 weeks. Gastrocnemius muscles and serum were collected from CON and EtOH mice 
every 4-h for 24-h. Chronic alcohol consumption disrupted genes of the core 
clock including suppressing the rhythmic peak of expression of Bmal1, Per1, 
Per2, and Cry2. Genes involved in the regulation of Bmal1 also exhibited lower 
rhythmic peaks including Reverb α and Myod1. The CCGs, Dbp, Lpl, Hk2, and Hadh 
were also suppressed by alcohol. The nuclear expression patterns of MYOD1, DBP, 
and REVERBα were shifted by alcohol, while no change in BMAL1 was detected. 
Overall, these data indicate that alcohol disrupted the skeletal muscle core 
clock but whether these changes in the core clock are causative or a consequence 
of alcoholic myopathy requires future mechanistic confirmation."
123,"Subcellular mRNA quantities and spatial distributions are fundamental for 
driving gene regulatory programs. Single molecule RNA FISH (smFISH) uses 
fluorescent probes to label individual mRNA molecules, thereby facilitating both 
localisation and quantitative studies. Validated reference mRNAs function as 
positive controls and are required for calibration. Here we present selection 
criteria for the first set of Arabidopsis smFISH reference genes. Following 
sequence and transcript data assessments, four mRNA probe sets were selected for 
imaging. Transcript counts per cell, correlations with cell size and corrected 
fluorescence intensities were all calculated for comparison. In addition to 
validating reference probe sets, we present sample preparation steps that can 
retain GFP fluorescence, thereby providing a method for simultaneous RNA and 
protein detection. In summary, our reference gene analyses, modified protocol 
and simplified quantification method together provide a firm foundation for 
future quantitative single molecule RNA studies in Arabidopsis root apical 
meristem cells."
124,"Functionally distinct CD4 + helper T (Th) cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, 
Th17, and regulatory T cells (Treg), play a pivotal role in the regulation of 
acquired immunity. Although the key proteins involved in the regulation of Th 
cell differentiation have already been identified, how the proteogenomic 
landscape changes during the Th cell activation remains unclear. To address this 
issue, we characterized proteogenomic signatures of differentiation to each Th 
cell subsets by RNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-assisted mass 
spectrometry, which enabled us to simultaneously quantify more than 10,000 
protein-coding transcripts and 8,000 proteins in a single-shot. The results 
indicated that T-cell receptor activation affected almost half of the transcript 
and protein levels in a low correlative and gene-specific manner, and specific 
cytokine treatments modified the transcript and protein profiles in a manner 
specific to each Th cell subsets: Th17 and Tregs particularly exhibited unique 
proteogenomic signatures compared to other Th cell subsets. Interestingly, the 
in-depth proteome data revealed that mRNA profiles alone were not enough to 
delineate functional changes during Th cell activation, suggesting that the 
proteogenomic dataset obtained in this study serves as a unique and 
indispensable data resource for understanding the comprehensive molecular 
mechanisms underlying effector Th cell differentiation."
125,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumor types 
occurring in the digestive system. The incidence of CRC has exhibits yearly 
increases and the mortality rate among patients with CRC is high. The 
Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway, which is associated with carcinogenesis, is 
abnormally activated in CRC. Most patients with CRC have adenomatous polyposis 
coli mutations, while half of the remaining patients have β‑catenin gene 
mutations. Therefore, targeting the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway for the 
treatment of CRC is of clinical value. In recent years, with in‑depth research 
on the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway, inhibitors have been developed that are 
able to suppress or hinder the development and progression of CRC. In the 
present review, the role of the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway in CRC is 
summarized, the research status on Wnt/β‑catenin pathway inhibitors is outlined 
and potential targets for inhibition of this pathway are presented."
126,"The mechanism underlying bladder cancer metastasis is associated with tumor 
angiogenesis. The present study aimed to evaluate the predictive role and value 
of an angiogenesis‑associated long non‑coding (lnc)RNA signature in patients 
with bladder cancer and the role of long intergenic non‑coding RNA (LINC)02321 
in the progression of this malignancy. Angiogenesis‑related lncRNAs were 
screened using Pearson correlation analysis and the signaturewas constructed 
using Cox regression analysis and evaluated using the receiver operating 
characteristic curve. LINC02321, which expressed the largest difference in 
bladder cancer, was screened using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. The 
role of LINC02321 in the malignant progression of bladder cancer was evaluated 
using Transwell, wound healing and Cell Counting Kit 8 assays. A total of six 
angiogenesis‑associated lncRNAs (USP30‑AS1, LINC02321, PSMB8‑AS1, KRT7‑AS, 
LINC01767 and OCIAD1‑AS1) were identified as candidates for the prognostic 
signature using Cox regression analysis. The overall survival of patients in the 
low‑risk group was significantly longer compared with that in the high‑risk 
group, with the highest area under the curve value being 0.807. A nomogram was 
constructed based on the traditional clinical indicators (age, sex, grade, 
American Joint Committee on Cancer stage) and risk score of patients. Compared 
with the traditional clinical indicators, the risk score demonstrated better 
clinical prediction capacity for predicting the prognosis of patients with 
bladder cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas prediction and RT‑qPCR experimental 
results demonstrated that only LINC02321 was highly expressed in bladder cancer 
tissue and promoted the proliferation, invasion, migration and cisplatin 
resistance of the malignancy. Gene set enrichment, Pearson's correlation 
analysis and experimental results demonstrated that the VEGFA signalling pathway 
may be involved in the LINC02321‑regulated progression of bladder cancer. In 
conclusion, the six angiogenesis‑associated lncRNA signatures reported in the 
present study may be used to predict the prognosis of patients with bladder 
cancer, and LINC02321 promoted malignant progression of bladder cancer via the 
VEGFA signalling pathway."

128,"BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have reported 23 gene loci related 
to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)-a potentially lethal condition characterized 
by a weakened dilated vessel wall. This study aimed to identify proteomic 
signatures and pathways related to these risk loci to better characterize AAA 
genetic susceptibility.
METHODS: Plasma concentrations of 4870 proteins were determined using a DNA 
aptamer-based array. Linear regression analysis estimated the associations 
between the 23 risk alleles and plasma protein levels with adjustments for 
potential confounders in a race-stratified analysis of 1671 Black and 7241 White 
participants. Significant proteins were then evaluated for their prediction of 
clinical AAA (454 AAA events in 11 064 individuals), and those significantly 
associated with AAA were further interrogated using Mendelian randomization 
analysis.
RESULTS: Risk variants proximal to PSRC1-CELSR2-SORT1, PCIF1-ZNF335-MMP9, 
RP11-136O12.2/TRIB1, ZNF259/APOA5, IL6R, PCSK9, LPA, and APOE were associated 
with 118 plasma proteins in Whites and 59 were replicated in Black participants. 
Novel associations with clinical AAA incidence were observed for kit ligand (HR, 
0.59 [95% CI, 0.42-0.82] for top versus first quintiles) and neogenin (HR, 0.64 
[95% CI, 0.46-0.88]) over a median 21.2-year follow-up; neogenin was also 
associated with ultrasound-detected asymptomatic AAA (N=4295; 57 asymptomatic 
AAA cases). Mendelian randomization inverse variance weighted estimates 
suggested that AAA risk is promoted by lower levels of kit ligand (OR per 
SD=0.67; P=1.4×10-5) and neogenin (OR per SD=0.50; P=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of neogenin and kit ligand may be novel risk factors for 
AAA development in potentially causal pathways. These findings provide insights 
and potential targets to reduce AAA susceptibility."
129,"BACKGROUND: When aortic cells are under stress, such as increased hemodynamic 
pressure, they adapt to the environment by modifying their functions, allowing 
the aorta to maintain its strength. To understand the regulation of this 
adaptive response, we examined transcriptomic and epigenomic programs in aortic 
smooth muscle cells (SMCs) during the adaptive response to AngII (angiotensin 
II) infusion and determined its importance in protecting against aortic aneurysm 
and dissection (AAD).
METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell sequencing 
assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) analyses in a mouse 
model of sporadic AAD induced by AngII infusion. We also examined the direct 
effects of YAP (yes-associated protein) on the SMC adaptive response in vitro. 
The role of YAP in AAD development was further evaluated in AngII-infused mice 
with SMC-specific Yap deletion.
RESULTS: In wild-type mice, AngII infusion increased medial thickness in the 
thoracic aorta. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed an adaptive 
response in thoracic SMCs characterized by upregulated genes with roles in wound 
healing, elastin and collagen production, proliferation, migration, cytoskeleton 
organization, cell-matrix focal adhesion, and AKT and TGF-β signaling. 
ScATAC-seq analysis showed increased chromatin accessibility at regulatory 
regions of adaptive genes and revealed the mechanical sensor YAP/transcriptional 
enhanced associate domains as a top candidate transcription complex driving the 
expression of these genes (eg, Lox, Col5a2, Tgfb2). In cultured human aortic 
SMCs, cyclic stretch activated YAP, which directly bound to adaptive gene 
regulatory regions (eg, Lox) and increased their transcript abundance. 
SMC-specific Yap deletion in mice compromised this adaptive response in SMCs, 
leading to an increased AAD incidence.
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic stress triggers the systemic epigenetic induction of an 
adaptive response (eg, wound healing, proliferation, matrix organization) in 
thoracic aortic SMCs that depends on functional biomechanical signal 
transduction (eg, YAP signaling). Our study highlights the importance of the 
adaptive response in maintaining aortic homeostasis and preventing AAD in mice."
130,"OBJECTIVES: Stem cells of the apical papilla (SCAPs) provide promising 
candidates for dental pulp regeneration. Despite great advances in the 
transcriptional controls of the SCAPs fate, little is known about the regulation 
of SCAP differentiation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Short hairpin RNAs and full-length RNA were used to 
deplete or overexpress lysine demethylase 4D (KDM4D) gene expression. Western 
blotting, real-time RT-PCR, alizarin red staining, and scratch migration assays 
were used to study the role of KDM4D and the ribosomal protein encoded by RPS5 
in SCAPs. RNA microarray, chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and 
co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed to explore the underlying 
molecular mechanisms.
RESULTS: KDM4D enhanced the osteo/dentinogenic differentiation, migration, and 
chemotaxis of SCAPs. The microarray results revealed that 88 mRNAs (14 
upregulated and 74 downregulated) were differentially expressed in 
KDM4D-overexpressed SCAPs. ChIP results showed knock-down of KDM4D increased the 
level of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 in CNR1 promoter region. There were 37 possible 
binding partners of KDM4D. KDM4D was found to combine with RPS5, which also 
promoted the osteo/dentinogenic differentiation, migration, and chemotaxis of 
SCAPs.
CONCLUSIONS: KDM4D promoted the osteo/dentinogenic differentiation and migration 
potential of SCAPs in combination with RPS5, which provides a therapeutic clue 
for improving SCAPs-based dental tissue regeneration."
131,"Accurate predictions of pathogenicity for mutations associated with genetic 
disease are key to the success of precision medicine. Inherited, missense coding 
mutations in the myocilin gene (MYOC), within its olfactomedin (OLF) domain, 
comprise the strongest genetic link to primary open angle glaucoma via a toxic 
gain of function, and MYOC is an attractive precision medicine target. However, 
not all mutations in MYOC cause glaucoma, and common variants are expected to be 
neutral polymorphisms. The gnomAD database lists ∼100 missense variants 
documented within OLF, all of which are relatively rare (allele frequency 
<0.001%) and nearly all are of unknown pathogenicity. To disambiguate disease 
from benign OLF variants, we first characterized the most prevalent 
population-based variants using a suite of cellular and biophysical assays, and 
identify two variants with features of aggregation-prone familial disease 
variants. Next, we consider all available biochemical and clinical data to 
demonstrate that pathogenic and benign variants can be differentiated 
statistically based on a single metric, thermal stability of OLF. Our results 
motivate genotyping MYOC in patients for clinical monitoring of this widespread, 
painless, and irreversible age-onset disease."
132,"OBJECTIVES: Numerous diseases and disorders are associated with mitochondrial 
DNA (mtDNA) mutations, among which m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T mutations in the 
12 S ribosomal RNA gene contribute to aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic 
hearing loss worldwide.
METHODS: A total of 76,842 qualified non-invasive prenatal (NIPT) samples were 
subjected to mtDNA mutation and haplogroup analysis.
RESULTS: We detected 181 m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T mutations, 151 of which 
were subsequently sequenced for full-length mitochondrial genome verification. 
The positive predictive values for the m.1555A > G and m.1494C > T mutations 
were 90.78% and 90.00%, respectively, a performance comparable to that attained 
with newborn hearing screening. Furthermore, mitochondrial haplogroup analysis 
revealed that the 12 S rRNA 1555A > G mutation was enriched in sub-haplotype 
D5[p = 0, OR = 4.6706(2.81-7.78)].
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the non-invasive prenatal testing of 
cell-free DNA obtained from maternal plasma can successfully detect m.1555A > G 
and m.1494C > T mutations."
133,"Tuberculosis remains a global health threat with high morbidity. Dendritic cells 
(DCs) participate in the acute and chronic inflammatory responses to 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by directing the adaptive immune response and 
are present in lung granulomas. In macrophages, the interaction of lipid 
droplets (LDs) with mycobacteria-containing phagosomes is central to 
host-pathogen interactions. However, the data available for DCs are still a 
matter of debate. Here, we reported that bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) were 
susceptible to Mtb infection and replication at similar rate to macrophages. 
Unlike macrophages, the analysis of gene expression showed that Mtb infection 
induced a delayed increase in lipid droplet-related genes and proinflammatory 
response. Hence, LD accumulation has been observed by high-content imaging in 
late periods. Infection of BMDCs with killed H37Rv demonstrated that LD 
accumulation depends on Mtb viability. Moreover, infection with the attenuated 
strains H37Ra and M. bovis-BCG induced only an early transient increase in LDs, 
whereas virulent Mtb also induced delayed LD accumulation. In addition, 
infection with the BCG strain with the reintroduced virulence RD1 locus induced 
higher LD accumulation and bacterial replication when compared to parental BCG. 
Collectively, our data suggest that delayed LD accumulation in DCs is dependent 
on mycobacterial viability and virulence."
134,"Background: A better understanding of the influence of genetic factors on the 
response to lifestyle interventions in people with obesity may allow the 
development of more personalised, effective and efficient therapeutic 
strategies. We sought to determine the influence of six obesity-related genetic 
risk scores on the magnitude of weight lost by patients with severe obesity who 
completed a dietary intervention. Methods: In this single-centre prospective 
cohort study, participants with severe and complicated obesity who completed a 
24-week, milk-based meal replacement programme were genotyped to detect the 
frequency of common risk alleles for obesity and type 2 diabetes-related traits. 
Genetic risk scores (GRS) for six of these traits were derived. Participants 
with a potentially deleterious monogenic gene variant were excluded from the 
analysis. Results: In 93 patients completing the programme who were not carrying 
a known obesity-related gene mutation, 35.5% had diabetes, 53.8% were female, 
mean age was 51.4 ± 11 years, mean body mass index was 51.5 ± 8.7 and mean total 
weight loss percent at 24 weeks was 16 ± 6.3%. The waist-hip ratio (WHR) GRS was 
inversely associated with percentage total weight loss at 24 weeks (adjusted β 
for one standard deviation increase in WHR GRS -11.6 [-23.0, -0.3], p = 0.045), 
and patients in the lowest tertile of WHR GRS lost more weight. Conclusions: 
Patients with severe and complicated obesity with a genetic predisposition to 
central fat accumulation had less weight loss in a 24-week milk-based meal 
replacement programme, but there was no evidence for influence from the five 
other obesity-related genetic risk scores on the response to dietary 
restriction."
135,"The clinical use of genomic analysis has expanded rapidly resulting in an 
increased availability and utility of genomic information in clinical care. We 
have developed an infrastructure utilizing informatics tools and clinical 
processes to facilitate the use of whole genome sequencing data for population 
health management across the healthcare system. Our resulting framework scaled 
well to multiple clinical domains in both pediatric and adult care, although 
there were domain specific challenges that arose. Our infrastructure was 
complementary to existing clinical processes and well-received by care providers 
and patients. Informatics solutions were critical to the successful deployment 
and scaling of this program. Implementation of genomics at the scale of 
population health utilizes complicated technologies and processes that for many 
health systems are not supported by current information systems or in existing 
clinical workflows. To scale such a system requires a substantial clinical 
framework backed by informatics tools to facilitate the flow and management of 
data. Our work represents an early model that has been successful in scaling to 
29 different genes with associated genetic conditions in four clinical domains. 
Work is ongoing to optimize informatics tools; and to identify best practices 
for translation to smaller healthcare systems."
136,"This case series presents the novel genetic addiction risk score (GARS), which 
shows a high prevalence of polymorphic risk alleles of reward genes in a nuclear 
family with multiple reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) behavioral issues 
expressing a hypodopaminergic antecedent. The family consists of a mother, 
father, son, and daughter. The mother experienced issues with focus, memory, 
anger, and amotivational syndrome. The father experienced weight issues and 
depression. The son experienced heavy drinking, along with some drug abuse and 
anxiety. The daughter experienced depression, lethargy, brain fog, focus issues, 
and anxiety, among others. A major clinical outcome of the results presented to 
the family members helped reduce personal guilt and augment potential hope for 
future healing. Our laboratory's prior research established that carriers of 
four or more alleles measured by GARS (DRD1-DRD4, DAT1, MOR, GABABR3, COMT, 
MAOAA, and 5HTLPR) are predictive of the addiction severity index (ASI) for drug 
abuse, and carriers of seven or more alleles are predictive of severe 
alcoholism. This generational case series shows the impact that genetic 
information has on reducing stigma and guilt in a nuclear family struggling with 
RDS behaviors. The futuristic plan is to introduce an appropriate DNA-guided 
""pro-dopamine regulator"" into the recovery and enhancement of life."
137,"We aimed to investigate the impact of aging on the relationship among the 
composition of gut microbiota, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and the course of 
treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) by analyzing the datasets from our 
previous study. Patients with MDD were recruited, and their stools were 
collected at three time points (baseline, midterm, and endpoint) following the 
usual antidepressant treatment. Gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing. Patients were categorized into two groups based on their age: the 
late-life group over 60 years and the middle-aged group under 60 years. GI 
symptoms were assessed with scores of item 11 of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating 
Scale. One hundred and ninety samples were collected from 32 patients with MDD. 
Several gut microbes had higher relative abundances in the late-life group than 
in the middle-aged group. In addition, the late-life group showed significantly 
higher diversity in the Chao1 index at baseline compared with the middle-aged 
group. We further found possible microbial taxa related to GI symptoms in 
patients with late-life depression. The abundance of several bacterial taxa may 
contribute to GI symptoms in the late-life depression, and our findings suggest 
that the therapeutic targets for the application of gut microbiota may differ 
depending on the age group of patients with depression."
138,"We describe our institutional experience of developing a liquid biopsy approach 
using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis for personalized medicine in cancer 
patients, focusing on the hurdles encountered during the multistep process in 
order to benefit other investigators wishing to set up this type of study in 
their institution. Blood samples were collected at the time of cancer surgery 
from 209 patients with one of nine different cancer types. Extracted tumor DNA 
and circulating cell-free DNA were sequenced using cancer-specific panels and 
the Illumina MiSeq machine. Almost half of the pairs investigated were 
uninformative, mostly because there was no trackable pathogenic mutation 
detected in the original tumor. The pairs with interpretable data corresponded 
to 107 patients. Analysis of 48 gene sequences common to both panels was 
performed and revealed that about 40% of these pairs contained at least one 
driver mutation detected in the DNA extracted from plasma. Here, we describe the 
choice of our overall approach, the selection of the cancer panels, and the 
difficulties encountered during the multistep process, including the use of 
several tumor types and in the data analysis. We also describe some case reports 
using longitudinal samples, illustrating the potential advantages and rewards in 
performing ctDNA sequencing to monitor tumor burden or guide treatment for 
cancer patients."
139,"Congenital and early onset bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is mainly 
caused by mutations in numerous genes. The introduction of universal newborn 
hearing screening (UNHS) has increased the number of infants with mild, 
moderate, and moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) detected in 
the first year of life. We aimed to evaluate the audiological features in 
patients with mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe SNHL according to genotype. 
Audiological and genetic data were analyzed for 251 patients and their relatives 
with congenital bilateral mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe SNHL. Hearing 
loss severity, audiogram profile, interaural symmetry, and dynamics of hearing 
thresholds were analyzed. In this case, 165 patients had GJB2 gene mutations, 30 
patients were identified with STRC mutations, and 16 patients had pathogenic or 
likely pathogenic USH2A mutations. The presence of at least one GJB2 
non-truncating variant in genotype led to less severe hearing impairment. The 
flat and gently sloping audiogram profiles were mostly revealed in all groups. 
The follow-up revealed the stability of hearing thresholds. GJB2, STRC, and 
USH2A pathogenic variants were detected in most patients in our cohort and were 
congenital in most cases."
140,"Genetic polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 genes can cause variation in 
metabolism. Thus, single nucleotide variants significantly impact drug 
pharmacokinetics, toxicity factors, and efficacy and safety of medicines. The 
distribution of CYP450 alleles varies drastically across ethnicities, with 
significant implications for personalized medicine and the healthcare system. We 
combined whole-genome and exome sequencing data to provide a review of CYP450 
allele polymorphisms with clinical importance. Data were collected from 800 
unrelated Iranians (100 subjects from 8 major ethnicities of Iran), more than 
32,000 unrelated Europeans (other than Caucasian), and four Middle Eastern 
countries. We analyzed the frequencies and similarities of 17 CYP450 frequent 
alleles related to nine important CYP450 isoenzymes and homozygous and 
heterozygous genotypes based on these alleles in eight major Iranian ethnics by 
integrating these data with population-specific linkage information and compared 
these datasets with mentioned populations."
141,"ETS-related gene (ERG) fusion affects prostate cancer depending on the degree of 
expression of ERG. Solute Carrier Family 45 Member 3 (SLC45A3) is the 
second-most common 5' partner gene of ERG rearrangement. However, the molecular 
pathological features of SLC45A3:ERG (S:E) fusion and therapeutic methods have 
not been studied at all. S:E fusion-positive cancers (n = 10) were selected from 
the Tumor Fusion Gene Data Portal website. Fusion-negative cancers (n = 50) were 
selected by sorting ERG expression level in descending order and selecting the 
bottom to 50th sample. Totally, 1325 ERG correlated genes were identified by a 
Pearson correlation test using over 0.3 of absolute correlation coefficiency 
(|R| &gt; 0.3). Pathway analysis was performed using over-representation 
analysis of correlated genes, and seven cancer-related pathways (focal adhesion 
kinase (FAK)/PI3K-Akt, JAK-STAT, Notch, receptor tyrosine kinase/PDGF, TGF-β, 
VEGFA, and Wnt signaling) were identified. In particular, focal adhesion kinase 
(FAK)/PI3K-Akt signaling and JAK-STAT signaling were significantly enriched in 
S:E fusion-positive prostate cancer. We further identified therapeutic targets 
and candidate drugs for S:E fusion-positive prostate cancer using gene-drug 
network analysis. Interestingly, PDGFRA and PDGFRB were the most frequently 
predicted therapeutic targets, and imatinib targeted both genes. In this study, 
we provide extensive information on cellular signaling pathways involved in S:E 
fusion-positive prostate cancer and also suggest therapeutic methods."
142,"BACKGROUND: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most prevalent type of 
lymphoma that is potentially curable by chemotherapy. Immunogenic cell death 
(ICD) is regarded as an essential process for the clearance of residual tumor 
cells. However, the impact of ICD on DLBCL remains unknown. Here, we tried to 
explore the prognostic role of ICD in DLBCL.
METHODS: A gene expression microarray of DLBCL was downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO). The genes involved in ICD were obtained via literature 
reviews. Then, based on univariate, multivariate, and LASSO Cox regression 
analysis, the ICD-related gene signature was identified. The effect of the 
ICD-related gene signature on DLBCL was explored. The chi-square test was used 
to compare complete response rate (CRR) and recurrence rate between high- and 
low-risk groups.
RESULTS: The signature based on 12 ICD-related genes could independently predict 
the overall survival of DLBCL. Furthermore, high risk was linked to lower CRR 
and higher recurrence rate. Then, a nomogram based on the ICD-related gene 
signature was established. The area under the curve of the prediction model 
reached 0.820 in the training set and 0.780 in the validation set.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that the ICD-related gene signature could be a 
novel prognostic indicator for DLCBL."
143,"Hepatic fibrosis (HF) is a major cause of liver-related disorders and together 
with cancer-associated fibroblasts can favor liver cancer development by 
modulating the tumor microenvironment. Advanced HF, characterized by an excess 
of extracellular matrix (ECM), is mediated by TGF- β1, that activates hepatic 
stellate cells (HSCs) and fibroblasts. A TGF-β1 receptor inhibitor, LY2157299 or 
Galunisertib (GLY), has shown promising results against chronic liver 
progression in animal models, and we show that it can be further improved by 
enhancing GLYs bioavailability through encapsulation in polymeric 
polygalacturonic-polyacrylic acid nanomicelles (GLY-NMs). GLY-NMs reduced HF in 
an in vivo rat model of liver fibrosis induced by intraperitoneal injection of 
CCl4 as shown by the morphological, biochemical, and molecular biology 
parameters of normal and fibrotic livers. Moreover, GLY-NM was able to induce 
recovery from HF better than free GLY. Indeed, the encapsulated drug reduces 
collagen deposition, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation, prevents fatty 
degeneration and restores the correct lobular architecture of the liver as well 
as normalizes the serum parameters and expression of the genes involved in the 
onset of HF. In summary, GLY-NM improved the pharmacological activity of the 
free TGF- β1 inhibitor in the in vivo HF treatment and thus is a candidate as a 
novel therapeutic strategy."
144,"The approval of larotrectinib and entrectinib for cancer patients harboring an 
NTRK gene fusion has represented a milestone in the era of ""histology-agnostic"" 
drugs. Among the clinical trials that led to the approval of these two drugs, 
most of the enrolled patients were affected by soft tissue sarcomas, lung, and 
salivary gland cancer. However, as next-generation sequencing assays are 
increasingly available in the clinical setting, health care professionals may be 
able to detect NTRK gene fusions in patients affected by tumor types under or 
not represented in the clinical trials. To this aim, we systematically reviewed 
MEDLINE from its inception to 31 August 2022 for case reports and case series on 
patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive tumors treated with TRK inhibitors. A 
virtual cohort of 43 patients was created, excluding those enrolled in the 
above-mentioned clinical trials. Although our results align with those existing 
in the literature, various cases of central nervous system tumors were 
registered in our cohort, confirming the benefit of these agents in this 
subgroup of patients. Large, multi-institutional registries are needed to 
provide more information about the efficacy of TRK inhibitors in cancer patients 
affected by tumor types under or not represented in the clinical trials."
145,"The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway plays a key role in cancer, 
influencing growth, proliferation, and survival of tumor cells. PIK3CA mutations 
are generally oncogenic and responsible for uncontrolled cellular growth. PI3K 
inhibitors (PI3Ki) can inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, although burdened by 
not easily manageable toxicity. Among PI3Ki, alpelisib, a selective p110α 
inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)+/HER2- PIK3CA 
mutant metastatic breast cancer (BC) that has progressed to a first line 
endocrine therapy. PIK3CA mutations are also present in triple negative BC 
(TNBC) and HER2+ BC, although the role of PI3K inhibition is not well 
established in these subtypes. In this review, we go through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
pathway, describing most common mutations found in PI3K genes and how they can 
be detected. We describe the available biological and clinical evidence of 
PIK3CA mutations in breast cancers other than HR+/HER2-, summarizing clinical 
trials investigating PI3Ki in these subtypes."
146,"INTRODUCTION: Differential diagnostics of early-onset schizophrenia and autism 
spectrum disorders (ASD) are a problem of child psychiatry. The prognosis and 
relevant treatment are to a large degree determined by the correctness of 
diagnosis. We found earlier that leucocyte DNA of adult schizophrenia patients 
contained significantly larger copy numbers of ribosomal repeats (rDNA) coding 
for rRNA, than DNA of mentally healthy controls.
AIM: To compare the contents of ribosomal repeats in the leucocyte DNA of 
children with schizophrenia, children with ASD, and healthy age-matched controls 
to estimate the possibility of using this genetic trait in the differential 
diagnostics of the two types of disorders.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples of patients with infantile autism (A-F84.0 
according to ICD-10, N = 75) and with childhood-onset schizophrenia (SZ-F20.8 
according to ICD-10, N = 43) were obtained from the Child Psychiatry Department 
of the Mental Health Research Center. The healthy control blood samples (HC, N = 
86) were taken from the Research Centre for Medical Genetics collection. The 
recruitment of cases was based on the clinical psychopathologic approach. DNA 
was extracted from blood leukocytes with organic solvents. Nonradioactive 
quantitative hybridization technique was applied for determining the abundance 
of ribosomal repeats in the genomes. Statistical processing was performed using 
StatPlus, Statgraphics and MedCalc.
FINDINGS: DNA derived from SZ cases contained 565 ± 163 rDNA copies, which is 
significantly (p &lt; 10-6) higher than the rDNA content in ASD cases (405 ± 109 
copies) and controls (403 ± 86 copies). The HC and A groups did not differ by 
rDNA copy number (p &gt; 0.4). The genetic trait ""rDNA copy number in patient's 
genome"" can potentially be applied as an additional marker in differential 
diagnostics of childhood-onset schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders."
147,"Since 1990, when our laboratory published the association of the DRD2 Taq A1 
allele and severe alcoholism in JAMA, there has been an explosion of genetic 
candidate association studies, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS). 
To develop an accurate test to help identify those at risk for at least alcohol 
use disorder (AUD), a subset of reward deficiency syndrome (RDS), Blum's group 
developed the genetic addiction risk severity (GARS) test, consisting of ten 
genes and eleven associated risk alleles. In order to statistically validate the 
selection of these risk alleles measured by GARS, we applied strict analysis to 
studies that investigated the association of each polymorphism with AUD or 
AUD-related conditions, including pain and even bariatric surgery, as a 
predictor of severe vulnerability to unwanted addictive behaviors, published 
since 1990 until now. This analysis calculated the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium of 
each polymorphism in cases and controls. Pearson's χ2 test or Fisher's exact 
test was applied to compare the gender, genotype, and allele distribution if 
available. The statistical analyses found the OR, 95% CI for OR, and the post 
risk for 8% estimation of the population's alcoholism prevalence revealed a 
significant detection. Prior to these results, the United States and European 
patents on a ten gene panel and eleven risk alleles have been issued. In the 
face of the new construct of the ""preaddiction"" model, similar to ""prediabetes"", 
the genetic addiction risk analysis might provide one solution missing in the 
treatment and prevention of the neurological disorder known as RDS."
148,"Reproductive genetic carrier screening (RGCS) provides people with information 
about their chance of having children with autosomal recessive or X-linked 
genetic conditions, enabling informed reproductive decision-making. RGCS is 
recommended to be offered to all couples during preconception or in early 
pregnancy. However, cost and a lack of awareness may prevent access. To address 
this, the Australian Government funded Mackenzie's Mission-the Australian 
Reproductive Genetic Carrier Screening Project. Mackenzie's Mission aims to 
assess the acceptability and feasibility of an easily accessible RGCS program, 
provided free of charge to the participant. In study Phase 1, implementation 
needs were mapped, and key study elements were developed. In Phase 2, RGCS is 
being offered by healthcare providers educated by the study team. Reproductive 
couples who provide consent are screened for over 1200 genes associated with 
&gt;750 serious, childhood-onset genetic conditions. Those with an increased 
chance result are provided comprehensive genetic counseling support. 
Reproductive couples, recruiting healthcare providers, and study team members 
are also invited to complete surveys and/or interviews. In Phase 3, a 
mixed-methods analysis will be undertaken to assess the program outcomes, 
psychosocial implications and implementation considerations alongside an ongoing 
bioethical analysis and a health economic evaluation. Findings will inform the 
implementation of an ethically robust RGCS program."
149,"Nocardia seriolae is a major causative agent of fish nocardiosis that results in 
serious economic losses in the aquaculture industry. However, the virulence 
factors and pathogenic mechanisms of the bacterium are poorly understood. Here, 
a new N. seriolae strain AHLQ20-01 was isolated from the diseased Micropterus 
salmoides and identified by phenotypic examination combined with 16S rRNA 
sequencing. Subsequently, the potential virulence factors of the strain were 
analysed at genome level by whole-genome sequencing. The results showed that the 
whole-genome sequence derived from N. seriolae AHLQ20-01 circular chromosome 
contains 8,129,380 bp DNA with G + C content of 68.14%, and encompasses 7650 
protein-coding genes, 114 pseudo-genes, 3 rRNAs, 66 tRNAs and 36 non-coding 
RNAs. More importantly, a total of 139 genes, which mainly involved in adhesion, 
invasion, resistance to oxidative and nitrosative stress, phagosome arresting, 
iron acquisition system, toxin production and bacterial secretion systems, were 
identified as core virulence-associated genes. Furthermore, the pathogenicity of 
N. seriolae AHLQ20-01 to M. salmoides was further investigated through 
experimental infection. It was found that the LD50 value of the strain to M. 
salmoides was 9.3 × 106  colony forming unit/fish. Histopathological examination 
demonstrated typical granuloma with varying sizes in the liver, head kidney, 
spleen and heart of the experimentally infected fish. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase dUTP nick end labelling assay and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 
staining showed that there were distinctly more apoptotic cells in all the 
tested tissues in the infection group, but not in the control group. Together, 
these findings provide the foundation to further explore the pathogenic 
mechanism of N. seriolae, which might contribute to the prevention and treatment 
of fish nocardiosis."
150,"Macrophages, critical components of bone marrow microenvironment, are reported 
to be remodeled into leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs) in leukemic 
microenvironment where they contribute to leukemia development, characterized as 
M2 macrophages with pro-tumor effects. However, how leukemic microenvironment 
transforms macrophages into LAMs remains unknown. Here, we analyzed the clinical 
relevance of LAMs and profiled their RNA-Seq from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
patients with complete remission (CR) after induction treatment and refractory 
AML patients. Our results showed that the proportion and number of LAMs in 
refractory AML patients was higher than that in CR patients and LAM was a poor 
prognostic factor of AML patients. Furthermore, let-7b was a potentially 
aberrant gene in LAMs contributed to M2-subtype characteristics. Knockdown of 
let-7b in LAMs could inhibit the development of AML by repolarizing LAMs towards 
M1-subtype characteristics through the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 
and NF-κB pathway. Our study provides insight for future LAM-based immunotherapy 
strategies for AML. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
151,"Understanding the molecular mechanisms of pathological vascular remodeling is 
important for treating cardiovascular diseases and complications. Recent studies 
have highlighted a role of deubiquitinases in vascular pathophysiology. Here, we 
investigate the role of a deubiquitinase, OTUD1, in angiotensin II (Ang 
II)-induced vascular remodeling. We detect upregulated OTUD1 in the vascular 
endothelium of Ang II-challenged mice and show that OTUD1 deletion attenuates 
vascular remodeling, collagen deposition, and EndMT. Conversely, OTUD1 
overexpression aggravates these pathological changes both in vivo and in vitro. 
Mechanistically, SMAD3 is identified as a substrate of OTUD1 using 
co-immunoprecipitation followed by LC-MS/MS. We find that OTUD1 stabilizes SMAD3 
and facilitates SMAD3/SMAD4 complex formation and subsequent nuclear 
translocation through both K48- and K63-linked deubiquitination. OTUD1-mediated 
SMAD3 activation regulates transcription of genes involved in vascular EndMT and 
remodeling in HUVECs. Finally, SMAD3 inhibition reverses OTUD1-promoted vascular 
remodeling. Our findings demonstrate that endothelial OTUD1 promotes Ang 
II-induced vascular remodeling by deubiquitinating SMAD3. We identify SMAD3 as a 
target of OTUD1 and propose OTUD1 as a potential therapeutic target for diseases 
related to vascular remodeling."
152,"The somatic hypermutation (SHM) status of the clonotypic, rearranged 
immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene is an established prognostic and 
predictive marker in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Analysis of SHM is 
generally performed by PCR-amplification of clonal IGHV-IGHDIGHJ gene 
rearrangements followed by sequencing to identify IGHV gene sequences and 
germline identity. Targeted-hybridisation next-generation sequencing (NGS) can 
simultaneously assess clonality and other genetic aberrations, however it has 
limitations for SHM analysis due to sequence similarity between different IGHV 
genes and mutations introduced by SHM, which can affect alignment efficiency and 
accuracy. We have developed a novel SHM assessment strategy using a 
targeted-hybridisation NGS approach (EuroClonality-NDC assay) and applied it to 
331 samples of lymphoproliferative disorder (LPDs). Our strategy focuses on 
analysing the sequence downstream to the clonotypic, rearranged IGHJ gene up to 
the IGHM enhancer (IGHJ-E) which provides more accurate alignment. Overall, 
84/95 (88.4%) CLL cases with conventional SHM data showed concordant SHM status, 
increasing to 91.6% when excluding borderline cases. Additionally, IGHJ-E 
mutation analysis in a wide range of pre- and post-germinal centre LPD showed 
significant correlation with differentiation and lineage status, suggesting that 
IGHJ-E analysis is a promising surrogate marker enabling SHM to be reported 
using NGS-capture strategies and whole genome sequencing."
153,"Androgens have been reported to elongate telomeres in retrospective and 
prospective trials with patients with telomeropathies, mainly with bone marrow 
failure. In our single-arm prospective clinical trial, 17 patients with short 
telomeres and/or germline pathogenic variants in telomere-biology genes 
associated with at least one cytopenia and/or radiologic diagnosis of ILD were 
treated with 5 mg/kg of intramuscular nandrolone decanoate every 15 days for 2 
years. Ten of 13 evaluable patients (77%) showed telomere elongation at 12 
months by flow-FISH (average increase, 0.87 kb; 95% CI, 0.20-1.55 kb; p=0.01). 
At 24 months, all 10 evaluable patients showed telomere elongation (average 
increase, 0.49 kb; 95% CI, 0.24-1.23 kb; p=0.18). Hematologic response was 
achieved in 8/16 patients (50%) with marrow failure at 12 months, and in 10/16 
patients (63%) at 24 months. Seven patients had ILD at baseline, and two and 
three had pulmonary response at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Two patients 
died due to pulmonary failure during treatment. In the remaining evaluable 
patients, the pulmonary function remained stable or improved, but showed 
consistent decline after cessation of treatment. Somatic mutations in myeloid 
neoplasm-related genes were present in a minority of patients and were mostly 
stable during drug treatment. The most common adverse events (AE) were 
elevations in liver function test levels in 88%, acne in 59%, and virilization 
in 59%. No AE grade ≥ 4 was observed. Our findings indicate that nandrolone 
decanoate elongates telomeres in patients with telomeropathies, which correlated 
with clinical improvement in some cases and tolerable adverse events.

154,"BACKGROUND: Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) and Glycogen storage 
diseases (GSDs) are inborn metabolic disorders caused by defects in some 
metabolic pathways. These disorders are a heterogeneous group of diseases caused 
by impaired O- as well as N-glycosylation pathways. CDG patients show a broad 
spectrum of clinical presentations; many GSD types (PGM1-CDG) have muscle 
involvement and hypoglycemia.
METHODS: We applied WES for all seven patients presenting GSD and CDG symptoms. 
Then we analyzed the data using various tools to predict pathogenic variants in 
genes related to the patients' diseases.
RESULTS: In the present study, we identified pathogenic variants in Iranian 
patients suffering from GSD and CDG, which can be helpful for patient 
management, and family counseling. We detected seven pathogenic variants using 
whole exome sequencing (WES) in known AGL (c.1998A>G, c.3635T>C, c.3682C>T), 
PGM1 (c.779G>A), DPM1 (c.742T>C), RFT1 (c.127A>G), and GAA (c.1314C>A) genes.
CONCLUSION: The suspected clinical diagnosis of CDG and GSD patients was 
confirmed by identifying missense and or nonsense mutations in PGM1, DPM1, RFT1, 
GAA, and AGL genes by WES of all 7 cases. This study helps us understand the 
scenario of the disorder causes and consider the variants for quick disease 
diagnosis."
155,"BACKGROUND: Cell and gene therapies promise durable benefits but face financial 
challenges from the uncertainty in their performance. Value-based purchasing 
arrangements (VBPAs) can address uncertainty but have been inhibited in the US 
by the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) approach to determining Medicaid Best 
Price (MBP) rebates. The likely effectiveness of MDRP reform proposals enabling 
VBPAs is examined in this study for durable cell and gene therapies.
METHODS: Monte Carlo simulations examined three potential reforms (Multiple Best 
Prices, Bundled Sales, and National Pooling) to determine the impact on payment 
misalignment, the required payer size to participate, and the percentage of 
total lives covered by a VBPA.
RESULTS: Simulation results suggest that 11% to 54% of commercial US lives would 
be feasibly covered by a VBPA depending on reform type and condition size. MPB 
reform achieved the highest commercial contracted percentage and lowest 
misalignment for commercial payers compared to National Pooling and Bundled 
Sales. State Medicaid plan results suggest lower extreme misalignment across all 
successfully contracted instances than commercial payers.
CONCLUSIONS: The Multiple Best Prices will likely enable VBPAs for many durable 
cell and gene therapies and larger payers. Further reforms may be needed to 
extend VBPAs to ultra-orphan conditions."
156,"The innate immune system protects the host from external pathogens and internal 
damage in various ways. The cGAS-STING signaling pathway, comprised of cyclic 
GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes (STING), and downstream 
signaling adaptors, plays an essential role in protective immune defense against 
microbial DNA and internal damaged-associated DNA and is responsible for various 
immune-related diseases. After binding with DNA, cytosolic cGAS undergoes 
conformational change and DNA-linked liquid-liquid phase separation to produce 
2'3'-cGAMP for the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized STING. 
However, further studies revealed that cGAS is predominantly expressed in the 
nucleus and strictly tethered to chromatin to prevent binding with nuclear DNA, 
and functions differently from cytosolic-localized cGAS. Detailed delineation of 
this pathway, including its structure, signaling, and regulatory mechanisms, is 
of great significance to fully understand the diversity of cGAS-STING activation 
and signaling and will be of benefit for the treatment of inflammatory diseases 
and cancer. Here, we review recent progress on the above-mentioned perspectives 
of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and discuss new avenues for further study."
157,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that haloperidol biotransformation is 
mainly metabolized by CYP2D6. The CYP2D6 gene is highly polymorphic, 
contributing to inter-individual differences in enzymatic activity, and may 
impact haloperidol biotransformation rates, resulting in variable drug efficacy 
and safety profiles.
OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the correlation of the CYPD6 activity 
with haloperidol's efficacy and safety rates in patients with alcohol-induced 
psychotic disorders.
METHOD: One hundred male patients received 5-10 mg/day haloperidol by injections 
for 5 days. The efficacy and safety assessments were performed using PANSS, UKU, 
and SAS-validated psychometric scales.
RESULTS: No relationship between haloperidol efficacy or safety and the 
experimental endogenous pharmacometabolomic marker for CYP2D6 activity, urinary 
6-НО-ТНВС/pinoline ratio was identified. In contrast, we found a statistically 
significant association between haloperidol adverse events and the most common 
CYP2D6 loss-of-function allele CYP2D6*4 (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Evaluation of the single polymorphism rs3892097 that defines 
CYP2D6*4 can predict the safety profile of haloperidol in patients with AIPD, 
whereas metabolic evaluation using an endogenous marker was not a suitable 
predictor. Furthermore, our results suggest haloperidol dose reductions could be 
considered in AIPD patients with at least one inactive CYP2D6 allele."
158,"BACKGROUND: Onychomatricoma (OM) is a rare nail unit tumor with a characteristic 
presentation of fingerlike projections arising from the nail matrix. Due to the 
lack of transcriptome information, the mechanisms underlying its development are 
largely unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize molecular features involved in the disease 
pathogenesis.
METHODS: Digital spatial profiling (DSP) was conducted in 2 cases of OM and 
normal control nail units. Based on the histological evaluation, we selectively 
profiled 69 regions of interest covering epithelial and stromal compartments of 
each tissue section. Dermoscopic and histopathologic findings were reviewed in 6 
cases. Single-cell RNA sequencing of nail units and DSP were combined to define 
cell type contributions of OM.
RESULTS: We identified 173 genes upregulated in stromal compartments of OM 
compared to onychodermis, specialized nail mesenchyme. Gene ontology analysis of 
the upregulated genes suggested the role of Wnt pathway activation in OM 
pathogenesis. We also found PLA2G2A, a known modulator of Wnt signaling, is 
strongly and specifically expressed in the OM stroma. The potential role of Wnt 
pathway was further supported by strong nuclear localization of β-catenin in OM. 
Compared to the nail matrix epithelium, only a few genes were increased in OM 
epithelium. Deconvolution of nail unit cell types showed that onychofibroblasts 
are the dominant cell-type in OM stroma.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrated spatial and single-cell multi-omics concluded that OM is 
a tumor that derives a significant proportion of its origin from 
onychofibroblasts and is associated with upregulation of Wnt signals, which play 
a key role in the disease pathogenesis."
159,"Clinical tuberculosis (TB) screening and diagnosis are crucial for controlling 
the spread of this life-threatening infectious disease. In this work, a novel, 
rapid, and simple colorimetric detection platform for TB was developed based on 
a quantum dot-based nanobeacon (QD-NB) and multicomponent nucleic acid enzyme 
(MNAzyme). In the presence of target DNA (IS1081 gene fragment), the recombinase 
polymerase amplification (RPA) was performed and the amplicons were chemically 
DNA-denatured and then subjected to MNAzyme reaction. RNA-cleaving MNAzyme 
assembly included the recognition of target DNA and hybridization with a QD-NB 
fluorescence probe. Under the addition of Mg2+, the RNA-containing QD-NB as a 
cleavable substrate could be broken into two DNA fragments, leading to green 
fluorescence release due to their departure from a black hole quencher (BHQ2). 
The TB detection could be achieved with the naked eye under a portable and 
inexpensive UV flashlight. Our results demonstrated that QD-NB-based MNAzyme 
colorimetric assays improved the detection sensitivity by 1 order of magnitude 
compared with the detection using RPA. The limit of detection (LOD) of the 
visual reading was as low as 2 copies/μL (3.3 amol/L). Excellent specificity and 
reproducibility could also be achieved. Furthermore, the practical application 
of the colorimetric method for TB diagnosis was verified by 36 clinical TB 
patients and 20 healthy individuals. The developed QD-NB-based MNAzyme 
colorimetric assays provided a rapid, convenient, sensitive, and accurate 
alternative for clinical TB screening and diagnosis."
160,"The glucocorticoid stress hormones affect brain function via high-affinity 
mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and lower-affinity glucocorticoid receptors 
(GRs). MR and GR not only differ in affinity for ligands, but also have 
distinct, sometimes opposite, actions on neuronal excitability and other 
cellular and higher-order parameters related to cerebral function. GR and MR 
messenger RNA (mRNA) levels are often used as a proxy for the responsiveness to 
glucocorticoids, assuming proportionality between mRNA and protein levels. This 
may be especially relevant for the MR, which because of its high affinity is 
already largely occupied at low basal (trough) hormone levels. Here we explore 
how GR and MR mRNA levels are associated with the expression of a shared target 
gene, glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ, coded by Tsc22d3) with basal 
and elevated levels of corticosterone in male mice, using in situ hybridization. 
Depending on the hippocampal subfield and the corticosterone levels, mRNA levels 
of MR rather than GR mostly correlated with GILZ mRNA in the hippocampus and 
hypothalamus at the bulk tissue level. At the individual cell level, these 
correlations were much weaker. Using publicly available single-cell RNA 
sequencing data, we again observed that MR and GR mRNA levels were only weakly 
correlated with target gene expression in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. 
We conclude that MR mRNA levels can be limiting for receptor action, but many 
other cell-specific and region-specific factors ultimately determine 
corticosteroid receptor action. Altogether, our results argue for caution while 
interpreting the consequences of changed receptor expression for the response to 
glucocorticoids."
161,"BACKGROUND: Scorpion neurotoxins such as those that modify the mammalian 
voltage-gated sodium ion channels (Nav) are the main responsible for scorpion 
envenomation. Their neutralization is crucial in the production of antivenoms 
against scorpion stings.
METHODS: In the present study, two in silico designed genes - one that codes for 
a native neurotoxin from the venom of the Anatolian scorpion Androctonus 
crassicauda, named Acra 4 - and another non-native toxin - named consensus 
scorpion toxin (SccTx) obtained from the alignment of the primary structures of 
the most toxic neurotoxins from the Middle Eastern and North African scorpions - 
were recombinantly expressed in E. coli Origami.
RESULTS: Following bacterial expression, the two expressed neurotoxins, 
hereafter named HisrAcra4 and HisrSccTx, were obtained from inclusion bodies. 
Both recombinant neurotoxins were obtained in multiple Cys-Cys isoforms. After 
refolding, the active protein fractions were identified with molecular masses of 
8,947.6 and 9,989.1 Da for HisrAcra4 and HisrSccTx, respectively, which agreed 
with their expected theoretical masses. HisrAcra4 and HisrSccTx were used as 
antigens to immunize two groups of rabbits, to produce either anti-HisrAcra4 or 
anti-HisrSccTx serum antibodies, which in turn could recognize and neutralize 
neurotoxins from venoms of scorpion species from the Middle East and North 
Africa. The antibodies obtained from rabbits neutralized the 3LD50 of 
Androctonus australis, Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus and Buthus occitanus 
venoms, but they did not neutralize A. crassicauda and A. mauritanicus venoms. 
In addition, the anti-HisrAcra4 antibodies did not neutralize any of the five 
scorpion venoms tested. However, an antibody blend of anti-HisrAcra4 and 
anti-HisrSccTx was able to neutralize A. crassicauda and A. mauritanicus venoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Two recombinant Nav neurotoxins, from different peptide families, 
were used as antigens to generate IgGs for neutralizing scorpion venoms of 
species from the Middle East and North Africa."
162,"PURPOSE: To report a unique case of Dent Disease presenting with nyctalopia 
associated with vitamin A deficiency and abnormal electroretinogram findings 
without prior systemic symptomatology.
OBSERVATIONS: A 16-year-old male presented with a several month history of 
nyctalopia and peripheral vision deficits. Central visual acuity, anterior and 
posterior segment examinations, and macular optical coherence tomography were 
unremarkable. Electroretinogram (ERG) testing revealed a rod-cone dystrophic 
pattern, with further workup demonstrating serum vitamin A deficiency (VAD). 
Laboratory evaluation revealed renal dysfunction and proteinuria with a 
significantly elevated urinary retinol-binding protein (RBP). Kidney biopsy 
showed glomerular and tubular disease.Genetic screening for inherited renal 
disease was performed identifying a hemizygous pathogenic variant c.2152C>T 
(p.Arg718*) in the Chloride Voltage-Gated Channel 5 (CLCN5) gene, confirming the 
diagnosis of X-linked Dent Disease. Following vitamin A supplementation, our 
patient reported resolution of nyctalopia and reversal of abnormal ERG findings 
were demonstrated.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first case in the 
literature describing Dent disease solely presenting with ophthalmic symptoms of 
nyctalopia and abnormal electroretinogram findings that later reversed with 
vitamin A repletion. This case stresses the importance for clinicians to 
consider renal tubular disorders in the differential for VAD."
163,"Inherited thrombocytopenia (IT) is a heterogeneous group of diseases with a 
genetic origin. The primary symptom presented by patients is a reduced platelet 
count in the peripheral blood. Nevertheless, certain forms of IT are 
characterized by the occurrence of other congenital malformations or 
predisposition to acquire additional diseases. Five related subjects with 
lifelong thrombocytopenia were admitted to our clinic. A total of 16 cases of 
persistent thrombocytopenia were investigated in the family history. Molecular 
and cytogenetic analysis covered MECOM, MPL, RUNX1, ETV6, and GATA1 genes, whose 
mutations are known to cause predisposing forms of IT. The laboratory testing 
revealed thrombocytopenia ranging from 19 to 65 × 109/L in the subjects. Mild 
bleeding symptoms were present in each of the subjects, while two of five had a 
history of severe hemorrhage requiring transfusion of blood products. 
Establishing a diagnosis of IT protects the patient from unnecessary treatment 
and enables the appropriate surveillance."
164,"EngA is an essential and unique bacterial GTPase involved in ribosome 
biogenesis. The essentiality and species-specific variations among EngA 
homologues make the protein a potential target for future drug development. In 
this aspect, it is important to understand the variations of EngA among 
probiotic organisms and non-probiotic bacteria to understand species 
specificity. The search for variations among EngA homologues revealed a unique 
variant, exclusively found in Bifidobacterium and a few Actinobacteria species. 
Bifidobacterium possesses a multifunctional fusion protein, wherein EngA is 
fused with an N-terminal CMK (Cytidylate Monophosphate Kinase) domain. The 
resulting protein is therefore a large (70kDa size) with 3 consecutive P-loops 
and a 50 amino acid long linker connecting the EngA and CMK domains. EngA is 
known to regulate ribosome biogenesis via nucleotide-dependent conformational 
changes. The additional domain may introduce further intricate regulation in 
ribosome biogenesis or participate in newer biological processes. This study is 
the first attempt to characterise this novel class of bacterial EngA found in 
the Genus of Bifidobacteria."
165,"Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient, and deficiency of available Fe is one 
of the most important limiting factors for plant growth. In some species 
including Medicago truncatula, iron deficiency results in accumulation of 
riboflavin, a response associated with iron acquisition. However, how the 
plant's Fe status is integrated to tune riboflavin biosynthesis and how 
riboflavin levels affect iron acquisition and utilization remains largely 
unexplored. We report that protein kinase CIPK12 regulates ferric reduction by 
accumulation of riboflavin and its derivatives in roots of M. truncatula via 
physiological and molecular characterization of its mutants and over-expressing 
materials. Mutations in CIPK12 enhance iron accumulation and improve 
photosynthetic efficiency, whereas over-expression of CIPK12 shows the opposite 
phenotypes. The Calcineurin B-like proteins CBL3 and CBL8 interact with CIPK12, 
which negatively regulates the expression of genes encoding key enzymes in the 
riboflavin biosynthesis pathway. CIPK12 negatively regulates iron acquisition by 
suppressing accumulation of riboflavin and its derivatives in roots, which in 
turn influences ferric reduction activity by riboflavin-dependent electron 
transport under iron deficiency. Our findings uncover a new regulatory mechanism 
by which CIPK12 regulates riboflavin biosynthesis and iron-deficiency responses 
in plants. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
166,"BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is one of the prevalent neurological disorders 
characterized by disrupted synchronization between inhibitory and excitatory 
neurons. Disturbed membrane potential due to abnormal regulation of 
neurotransmitters and ion transport across the neural cell membrane 
significantly contributes to the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Potassium ion 
channels (KCN) regulate the resting membrane potential and are involved in 
neuronal excitability. Genetic alterations in the potassium ion channels (KCN) 
have been reported to result in the enhancement of the release of 
neurotransmitters, the excitability of neurons, and abnormal rapid firing rate, 
which lead to epileptic phenotypes, making these ion channels a potential 
therapeutic target for epilepsy. The aim of this study is to explore the 
variations reported in different classes of potassium ion channels (KCN) in 
epilepsy patients, their functional evaluation, and therapeutic strategies to 
treat epilepsy targeting KCN.
METHODOLOGY: A review of all the relevant literature was carried out to compile 
this article.
RESULT: A large number of variations have been reported in different genes 
encoding various classes of KCN. These genetic alterations in KCN have been 
shown to be responsible for disrupted firing properties of neurons. 
Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are the main therapeutic strategy to treat epilepsy. 
Some patients do not respond favorably to the AEDs treatment, resulting in 
pharmacoresistant epilepsy.
CONCLUSION: Further to address the challenges faced in treating epilepsy, recent 
approaches like optogenetics, chemogenetics, and genome editing, such as 
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), are emerging 
as target-specific therapeutic strategies."
167,"BACKGROUND: The liver is one of the crucial organs in humans and is responsible 
for the regulation of diverse processes, including metabolism, secretion, and 
detoxification. Ingestion of alcohol and drugs, environmental pollutants, and 
irradiation are among the risk factors accountable for oxidative stress in the 
liver. Plant flavonoids have the potential to protect the liver from damage 
caused by a variety of chemicals.
OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: The present study aims to summarize up-to-date 
information on the protective roles of plant flavonoids against liver damage.
METHODOLOGY: The literature information on the hepatoprotective plant flavonoids 
was assessed through various databases, which were searched from their 
respective inception until March 2022.
RESULTS: More than 70 flavonoids with hepatoprotective activity against a 
variety of models of liver toxicity have been reported across the literature. 
Among these are flavones (19), flavonols (30), flavanones (9), isoflavonoids 
(5), and biflavonoids (2). Several hepatoprotective mechanisms of action were 
reported in various classes of flavonoids, including flavones and flavonols 
(upregulation of the pro-survival ERK1/2 pathway; downregulation of apoptotic 
proteins, including Bax, Bcl-2, Bax, BH3, caspase-3, 8, 9, etc.), flavanones 
(downregulation of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1 β, IL-6, iNOS, etc.), isoflavonoids 
(downregulation of lipogenesis genes, such as SREBP-1c, LXRα, RXRα, PPARγ and 
ACC2, with concomitant upregulation of genes involved in β-oxidation, including 
AMPK and PPARα; inhibition of CYPs, such as CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B1, CYP2D6, 
CYP2E1 and CYP3A1/2).
CONCLUSION: The present work demonstrated the effectiveness of plant flavonoids 
against hepatic damage. However, more studies need to be performed regarding the 
cytotoxicity, pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of action of these very important 
cytoprotective flavonoids."
168,"Despite decades of efforts in genome sequencing and functional characterization, 
some important protein families remain poorly understood. In this study, we 
report the classification, evolution, and functions of the largely 
uncharacterized AIM24 protein family in plants, including the identification of 
a novel subfamily. We show that two AIM24 subfamilies (AIM24-A and AIM24-B) are 
commonly distributed in major plant groups. These two subfamilies not only have 
modest sequence similarities and different gene structures, but also are of 
independent bacterial ancestry. We performed comparative functional 
investigations on the two AIM24 subfamilies using three model plants, including 
the moss Physcomitrium patens, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, and the 
flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Intriguingly, despite their significant 
differences in sequence and gene structure, both AIM24 subfamilies are involved 
in ER stress tolerance and unfolded protein response (UPR). In addition, 
transformation of the AIM24-A gene from P. patens into the null mutant of 
AIM24-B of A. thaliana could at least partially rescue ER stress tolerance and 
UPR. We also discuss the role of AIM24 genes in plant development and other 
cellular activities. This study provides a unique example of parallel evolution 
in molecular functions, as well as a foundation for further investigations on 
the AIM24 family in plants."
169,"The Dong people are one of China's 55 recognized ethnic minorities, but there 
has been a long-lasting debate about the origins of the Dong people. Here, we 
performed whole genome resequencing of Kam Sweet Rice (KSR), a valuable, rare, 
and ancient rice landrace unique to the Dong people. Through comparative genomic 
analyses of KSR and other rice landraces south of the Yangtze River Basin in 
China, we provide evidence that the ancestors of the Dong people likely 
originated from the southeast coast of China at least 1000 years ago. Alien 
introgression and admixture in KSR demonstrated multiple migration events in the 
history of the Dong people. Genomic footprints of domestication demonstrated 
characteristics of KSR that arose from artificial selection and geographical 
adaptation by the Dong people. The key genes GS3, Hd1, and DPS1 (related to 
agronomic traits) and LTG1 and MYBS3 (related to cold tolerance) were identified 
as domesticated targets, reflecting crop improvement and changes in the 
geographical environment of the Dong people during migration. A genome-wide 
association study revealed a candidate yield-associated gene, Os01g0923300, a 
specific haplotype in KSR is essential for regulating grain number per panicle. 
RNA-seq and quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR results showed that 
this gene was more highly expressed in KSR than in ancestral populations, 
indicating that the gene may have great value in increasing yield potential in 
rice accessions. Taken together, our work develops a novel approach for studying 
human civilization and migration patterns and provides valuable genomic datasets 
and resources for future breeding of high-yield and climate-resilient rice 
varieties."
170,"BACKGROUND: Fremanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against calcitonin 
gene-related peptide for subcutaneous use to suppress migraine attacks. A phase 
3 study was conducted to investigate the safety of autoinjector (AI)-assisted 
self-injection of fremanezumab 225 mg.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The multicenter, open-label study involving 71 
patients with migraine was conducted between June 2020 and November 2020 at ten 
institutions in Japan. The study consisted of a 4-week (28-day) screening period 
and an 8-week (57-day) treatment period. According to the investigator's 
instructions, all patients successfully performed self-injection for 4 weeks at 
the institutional site and at home and maintained eDiaries of their headaches. 
The primary endpoint was safety of the drug based on treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs).
RESULTS: Treatment-emergent adverse events were more frequent after at-home 
injection than after at-site injection, but they were mainly injection site 
reactions and mostly mild. The safety profile was comparable, raising no 
concerns compared with what has been reported in previous studies. Both migraine 
days and headache days were decreased considerably.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, AI-assisted, at-home self-injection of fremanezumab was 
found to be generally safe and well-tolerated. This injection strategy is 
considered clinically meaningful in view of improved utility of and adherence to 
the drug."
171,"OBJECTIVES: Androgen receptor (AR) play a key role in the onset and progression 
of prostate cancer. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a polyphenolic compound 
and the active ingredient in green tea, which is involved in modulating gene 
expression through epigenetic alterations. Previous studies have shown that EGCG 
at low concentrations reduces the expression of AR and prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) in the LNCaP cell line of prostate cancer. In this study, the effect of 
higher EGCG concentrations on AR and PSA expression in LNCaP prostate cancer 
cell line was investigated.
METHODS: In this study, LNCaP prostate cancer cell line was used and after MTT 
test, concentrations of 40, 60 and 80 μg/mL EGCG were used for treatment. Then, 
the expression of AR and PSA genes was evaluated by RT-PCR. AR protein 
expression was also assessed by Western blotting.
RESULTS: The present study showed that treatment of LNCaPs cells by EGCG reduces 
cell proliferation. The IC50 value was 42.7 μg/mL under experimental conditions. 
It was also observed that EGCG at concentrations of 40 and 80 μg/mL increased 
the expression of AR and PSA (p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the effect of EGCG on AR expression 
was different at different concentrations, so that unlike previous studies, 
higher concentrations of EGCG (80 and 40 μg/mL) increased AR and PSA expression. 
It seems that due to the toxic effects of EGCG in high concentrations on cancer 
cells and the possibility of its effect on normal cells, more caution should be 
exercised in its use."
172,"Unlike birds and mammals, many teleosts have homomorphic sex chromosomes and 
changes in the chromosome carrying the sex-determining locus, termed 
""turnovers"", are common. Recent turnovers allow studies of several interesting 
questions. One question is whether the new sex-determining regions evolve to 
become completely non-recombining, and if so, how and why. Another is to test 
the prediction that evolutionary changes that benefit one sex will accumulate in 
the newly sex-linked region. To study these questions, we analyzed the genome 
sequences of two seahorse species of the Syngnathidae, a fish group in which 
many species evolved a unique structure, the male brood pouch. We find that both 
seahorse species have XY sex chromosome systems, and their sex chromosome pairs 
are not homologs, implying that at least one turnover event has occurred. The 
Y-linked regions respectively occupy 63.9% and 95.1% of the entire chromosome of 
the two species, and do not exhibit extensive sequence divergence with their 
X-linked homologs. We find evidence for occasional recombination between the 
extant sex chromosomes that may account for their homomorphic pattern. We argue 
that these Y-linked regions did not evolve by recombination suppression after 
the turnover. Instead, it can be explained by the ancestral nature of low 
crossover rate at the corresponding chromosome location. With such an ancestral 
crossover landscape, a turnover can instantly create an extensive Y-linked 
region. Finally, we investigate the adaptive evolution of male pouch related 
genes after they become Y-linked in the seahorse."
173,"Insights into the processes underpinning convergent evolution advance our 
understanding of the contributions of ancestral, introgressed, and novel genetic 
variation to phenotypic evolution. Phylogenomic analyses characterizing 
genome-wide gene tree heterogeneity can provide first clues about the extent of 
ILS and of introgression and thereby into the potential of these processes or 
(in their absence) the need to invoke novel mutations to underpin convergent 
evolution. Here, we were interested in understanding the processes involved in 
convergent evolution in open-habitat chats (wheatears of the genus Oenanthe and 
their relatives). To this end, based on whole-genome resequencing data from 50 
taxa of 44 species, we established the species tree, characterized gene tree 
heterogeneity, and investigated the footprints of ILS and introgression within 
the latter. The species tree corroborates the pattern of abundant convergent 
evolution, especially in wheatears. The high levels of gene tree heterogeneity 
in wheatears are explained by ILS alone only for 30% of internal branches. For 
multiple branches with high gene tree heterogeneity, D-statistics and 
phylogenetic networks identified footprints of introgression. Finally, long 
branches without extensive ILS between clades sporting similar phenotypes 
provide suggestive evidence for a role of novel mutations in the evolution of 
these phenotypes. Together, our results suggest that convergent evolution in 
open-habitat chats involved diverse processes and highlight that phenotypic 
diversification is often complex and best depicted as a network of interacting 
lineages."
174,"Flowering time is one of important agronomic traits determining the crop yield 
and affected by high temperature. When facing high ambient temperature, plants 
often initiate early flowering as an adaptive strategy to escape the stress and 
ensure successful reproduction. However, here we find opposing ways in the 
short-day crop soybean to respond to different levels of high temperatures, in 
which flowering accelerates when temperature changes from 25°C to 30°C, but 
delays when temperature reaches 35°C under short day. phyA-E1, possibly 
photoperiodic pathway, is crucial for 35°C mediated late flowering, however does 
not contribute to promoting flowering at 30°C. 30°C-induced upregulation of FT2a 
and FT5a leads to early flowering, independent of E1. Therefore, distinct 
responsive mechanisms are adopted by soybean when facing different levels of 
high temperatures for successful flowering and reproduction."
175,"The major autoantigens for pemphigus are desmogleins (Dsgs), cell-cell adhesive 
structure proteins, one of the desmosomal cadherins. Recent progress in 
molecular biology has revealed that IgG autoantibodies of classical pemphigus 
react with Dsg1 or Dsg3. Desmocollins (Dscs) also belong to the cadherin 
supergene family that provides structure to the desmosomes and play an important 
role in cell-to-cell adhesion. In addition to the presence of four desmosomal 
Dsg isoforms, i.e. Dsg1-4, Dsc1, 2 and 3, all of which are derived from 
different genes, Dsc1 has been previously identified as the target antigen of 
IgA autoantibodies in the subcorneal pustular dermatosis (SPD)-type of 
intercellular IgA dermatosis. In addition to the IgA anti-Dsc1 autoantiboides, 
the presence of IgG anti-Dsc autoantibodies is described in patients of some 
autoimmune bullous diseases. In particular, the current pemphigus detecting 
autoantibodies to Dscs has shown a tendency in atypical variants of pemphigus. 
Therefore, autoantibodies against Dscs alone may cause detachment of cell-cell 
adhesion in the epidermis in some pemphigus. However, except for the findings of 
a few in vitro and in vivo studies, there is currently no clear evidence for the 
pathogenicity of anti-Dsc autoantibodies in pemphigus, whereas significance of 
anti-Dsg autoantibodies is well established. This article describes the 
structure and function of the Dscs, and explores the evidence regarding the 
pathogenic role of anti-Dsc autoantibodies in pemphigus."
176,"Diphencyprone (DPCP) is a hapten that causes a delayed-type hypersensitivity 
reaction when applied topically. It has clinical uses in the treatment of 
various conditions such as melanoma metastases, warts, and alopecia areata, but 
the mechanisms are currently not well understood in humans. To further 
characterize the immunologic effects of DPCP, the authors performed a proteomic 
analysis of normal skin of eight healthy volunteers following a single 
application of DPCP and compared them with placebo-treated skin from the same 
volunteers. A total of 96 proteins were examined using the Olink immuno-oncology 
panel at 3 days (peak response), 14 days (partially resolved response), and 
120 days (completely resolved response). Our analysis revealed significant 
upregulation of markers of immune cell activation (interleukin [IL] 8), vascular 
and tissue remodeling (matrix metallopeptidase 12 [MMP12], nitric oxide synthase 
3 [NOS3]), antineoplastic markers (granzyme B [GZMB]), and the Th1 axis 
(interferon gamma [IFNG], chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand [CXCL] 9, CXCL10, 
CXCL11) at days 3 and 14 compared with placebo (p < 0.05). In addition, several 
negative regulators of immune function such as programmed cell death 1 (PD1), 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1) (p < 0.001), and lymphocyte activation 
gene 3 (LAG3) (p < 0.05) were significantly upregulated at days 3 and 14. This 
induction of negative regulators may explain the seemingly paradoxical 
therapeutic benefits of DPCP in autoimmune conditions such as alopecia areata. 
The current analysis also indicated IL-4 upregulation only at day 3, followed by 
IL-12 upregulation only at day 14, suggesting a transient Th2 response followed 
by Th1 polarization. Overall, these data suggest a complex and evolving 
immunological delayed-type hypersensitivity response to a single application of 
DPCP over time. Future proteomic studies of samples from patients with melanoma 
metastases, warts, and alopecia areata treated long term with DPCP are needed to 
further evaluate its pharmacologic mechanisms."
177,"BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common and serious complication of 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). LN pathogenesis is not fully understood. Axl 
receptor tyrosine kinase is upregulated and contributes to the pathogenic 
progress in LN. We have reported that Axl disruption attenuates nephritis 
development in mice.
METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles with RNA-seq 
using renal cortical samples from nephritic mice. Axl-KO mice were bred onto a 
B6.lpr spontaneous lupus background, and renal disease development was followed 
and compared to the Axl-sufficient B6.lpr mice. Finally, anti-glomerular 
basement membrane (anti-GBM) Ab-induced nephritic mice were treated with Axl 
small molecule inhibitor, R428, at different stages of nephritis development. 
Blood urine nitrogen levels and renal pathologies were evaluated.
RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis revealed that renal Axl activation contributed 
to cell proliferation, survival, and motility through regulation of the Akt, 
c-Jun, and actin pathways. Spontaneous lupus-prone B6.lpr mice with Axl 
deficiency showed significantly reduced kidney damages and decreased T cell 
infiltration compared to the renal damage and T cell infiltration in 
Axl-sufficient B6.lpr mice. The improved kidney function was independent of 
autoAb production. Moreover, R428 significantly reduced anti-GBM 
glomerulonephritis at different stages of GN development compared to the 
untreated nephritic control mice. R428 administration reduced inflammatory 
cytokine (IL-6) production, T cell infiltration, and nephritis disease activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study emphasize the important role of Axl 
signaling in LN and highlight Axl as an attractive target in LN."
178,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is one of the main treatments for esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma (ESCC), but its efficacy is limited by radioresistance. MicroRNAs 
play a crucial role in posttranscriptional regulation, which is linked to the 
cancer response to radiation.
METHODS: We successfully established a radioresistant cell line model by using 
fractionated irradiation. qRT-PCR was adopted to detect the expression of 
miR-4443 in human normal esophageal cell lines, tumor cells, and radioresistant 
cells. Next, CCK-8, colony formation, apoptosis, and cell cycle assays were used 
to assess the biological effect of miR-4443. Weighted gene coexpression network 
analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify potential radiosensitivity-related 
genes. Additionally, we predicted the probable targets of the miRNA using 
bioinformatic methods and confirmed them using Western blot.
RESULTS: miR-4443 was significantly upregulated in radioresistant ESCC cells. 
Enhancement of miR-4443 further decreased the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells, 
while inhibition of miR-4443 increased the radiosensitivity of ESCC cells. 
Notably, miR-4443 modulated radiosensitivity by influencing DNA damage repair, 
apoptosis, and G2 cycle arrest. By using WGCNA and experimental validation, we 
identified PTPRJ as a key target for miRNA-4443 to regulate radiosensitivity. 
The effects of miR-4443 overexpression or inhibition could be reversed by 
increasing or decreasing PTPRJ expression.
CONCLUSION: In this study, miR-4443 is found to promote radiotherapy resistance 
in ESCC cells by regulating PTPRJ expression, which provides a new perspective 
and clue to alleviate radioresistance."
179,"BACKGROUND: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a heterogeneous group of hereditary 
skin diseases characterized by skin fragility. Primary data on Taiwanese 
population remain scarce.
METHODS: We gathered clinical information from EB patients at National Cheng 
Kung University Hospital from January, 2012, to June, 2021. Diagnostic tests 
including transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence studies, and 
whole-exome sequencing (WES) were performed. The pathogenicity of novel 
splice-site mutations was determined through reverse transcriptase-PCR of skin 
mRNA followed by Sanger and/or RNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven EB patients from 45 families were included: 19 EB 
simplex, six junctional EB, and 52 dystrophic EB. Pathogenic variants were 
identified in 37 of 38 families (97.4%), in which WES was used as a first-line 
tool for mutational analysis; RNA sequencing determined pathogenic variants in 
the remaining one family. A total of 60 mutations in EB-related genes were 
identified, including 22 novel mutations. The mutations involved KRT5, KRT14, 
PLEC, COL17A1, LAMB3, LAMA3, ITGB4, and COL7A1. Over one-quarter of DEB patients 
had EB pruriginosa.
CONCLUSIONS: The distinct clinical presentation and molecular pathology of EB in 
Taiwan expand our understanding of this disorder. WES was an effective 
first-line diagnostic tool for identifying EB-associated variants. RNA 
sequencing complemented WES when multiple potentially pathogenic splice-site 
mutations were found."
180,"BACKGROUND: Novel biomarkers for personalizing anticoagulation remain 
undetermined. We aimed to investigate the association of plasma miRNAs with 
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) profiles of rivaroxaban.
METHODS: This is a multicenter, exploratory study of miRNAs in a Chinese 
population. Healthy volunteers and patients receiving rivaroxaban were enrolled 
in the study. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0-t h 
(AUC0-t) and anti-Xa activity at 3 h (AXA3h) were measured in healthy 
volunteers, and AXA3h was measured in patients. MiRNAs were detected by miRNA 
microarray in 26 healthy volunteers with 20 mg rivaroxaban, and quantitative 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to exclude undetectable 
ones. MiR-320a-3p and miR-483-5p were then quantified in 65 healthy volunteers 
and 71 patients. MiRNA levels at 3 h were compared between high and low AXA3h or 
AUC0-t subjects and in matched patients with or without bleeding during 
follow-up. The miRNA targets were predicted by TargetScan, miRTarBase, and 
miRDB. Validated genes were included in GO enrichment and KEGG analyses. The 
protein-protein interaction network was established by STRING and visualized by 
Cytoscape.
RESULTS: A total of 136 Chinese subjects completed the study. In healthy 
volunteers taking 15 mg rivaroxaban, the miR-320a level at 3 h was significantly 
positively correlated with AXA3h and AUC0-t (r = 0.359, p = 0.025; r = 0.370, 
p = 0.02, respectively). A positive correlation was also observed between 
miR-483 and AXA3h or AUC0-t (r = 0.372, p = 0.02; r = 0.523, p = 0.001, 
respectively). MiR-320a and miR-483 levels at 3 h in the higher AUC0-t group 
were significantly higher than those at 0 h. MiR-483 levels at 3 h may 
distinguish healthy volunteers with high or low AXA3h or AUC0-t. In the 10 mg 
fed subgroup, higher 3 h mir-483 levels were also observed compared with the 
control group. No significant differences were found in the comparisons among 
patients. Bioinformatic analysis showed that these miRNAs may play a regulatory 
role by targeting ABCG2, ITGB3, PTEN, MAPK1/3, etc. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-320a and 
miR-483 levels were found to be associated with PK and PD profiles of 
rivaroxaban in healthy Chinese subjects. Further studies are required to verify 
these findings and explore the mechanisms."
181,"Patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) require chemotherapy due to 
late detection, rapid disease progression, and low surgical resection rate. 
Tumor cell lines are extremely important in cancer research for drug discovery 
and development. Here, we established and characterized a new intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma cell line, ICC-X1. STR testing confirmed the absence of 
cross-contamination and high similarity to the original tissue. ICC-X1 exhibited 
typical epithelial morphology and formed tumor spheres in the suspension 
culture. The population doubling time was approximately 48 h. The cell line had 
a complex hypotriploid karyotype. The cell line exhibited a strong migration 
ability in vitro and cell inoculation into BALB/c nude mice led to the formation 
of xenografts. Additionally, ICC-X1 cells were sensitive to gemcitabine and 
paclitaxel but resistant to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. RNA sequencing 
revealed that the upregulated cancer-related genes were mainly enriched in 
several signaling pathways, including the TNF signaling pathway, NOD-like 
receptor signaling pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway. The downregulated 
cancer-related genes were mainly enriched in the Rap1 signaling pathway and 
Hippo signaling pathway among other pathways. In conclusion, we have created a 
new ICC cell line derived from Chinese patients. This cell line can be used as a 
preclinical model to study ICC, specifically tumor metastasis and drug 
resistance mechanisms."
182,"BACKGROUND: Unreasonable use of antibiotics and probiotics can alter the gut 
ecology, leading to antibiotic resistance and suboptimal health outcomes during 
early life. Our study aims are to clarify the association among antibiotic and 
probiotic exposure in early life, the microecology of the gut microbiota, and 
the development of antibiotic resistance; to investigate the long-term impact of 
antibiotics and probiotics on the health outcomes of infants and young children; 
and to provide a theoretical basis for the rational use of antibiotics and 
probiotics from a life course perspective.
METHODS: The study is a prospective, longitudinal birth cohort study conducted 
in Shaanxi Province, China from 2018 to 2024. A total of 3,000 eligible 
mother-child pairs will be enrolled from rural, suburban, and urban areas. The 
recruitment of the participants begins at pregnancy, and the newborns will be 
followed up for 2 years at successive timepoints: within 3 days after birth, 
42 days after birth, and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. Sociodemographic 
data, environmental exposures, dietary patterns, psychological conditions, and 
medical and drug histories are collected. Cognitive and behavioural development 
among infants and young children and questionnaires on antibiotic knowledge and 
behaviour among caregivers will be collected at 12 and 24 months of age. The 
faecal samples are collected and analysed by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing 
and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for antibiotic resistance genes.
DISCUSSION: The findings will inform antibiotic and probiotic use for pregnant 
women and infants and contribute to establishing rational use strategies of 
antibiotics and probiotics for paediatricians, health practitioners, and drug 
administration policy-makers.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial 
Registry (ChiCTR) platform, http://www.chictr.org.cn (Record ID: 
ChiCTR2100047531, June 20, 2021)."
183,"BACKGROUND: There had been isolated reports of the presence of novel Theileria 
annulata genotypes based on the 18S rRNA gene sequence data from India, Pakistan 
and Saudi Arabia; but, these studies were restricted to limited field samples. 
Additionally, no comparative study has been conducted on all the isolates of 
this parasite from different countries whose sequences are available in the 
nucleotide databases. Therefore, we aimed to study the genetic diversity of T. 
annulata based on all available nearly complete 18S rRNA gene sequences in the 
GenBank™. Out of a total of 312 gene sequences of T. annulata available in the 
NCBI database, only 70 nearly complete sequences (> 1527 bp) were used for 
multiple sequence alignment.
RESULTS: The maximum likelihood tree obtained using TN93 + G + I model 
manifested two major clades. All the valid host-cell transforming Theileria 
species clustered in one clade. The T. annulata designated sequences occupying 
this clade clustered together, excluding two isolates (DQ287944 and EU083799), 
and represented the true T. annulata sequences (n = 54). DQ287944 and EU083799 
exhibited close association with Theileria lestoquardi. In addition, 14 Indian 
sequences formed a large monophyletic group with published Theileria orientalis 
sequences. The broad range of sequence identity (95.8-100%) of T. annulata 
designated sequences indicated the presence of different Theileria spp. A closer 
analysis revealed the presence of three Theileria spp., namely, T. annulata, T. 
orientalis, and two isolates (DQ287944 and EU083799) closely related to T. 
lestoquardi. The true T. annulata sequences manifested 98.8-100% nucleotide 
identity within them. EU083799 and 14 misidentified Indian T. annulata sequences 
exhibited the highest similarity with T. lestoquardi (98.6-98.8%) and T. 
orientalis (98.0-99.9%) in comparison with the other Theileria spp. of domestic 
and wild ruminants.
CONCLUSION: In the course of analyzing the genetic diversity of T. annulata, we 
identified the nearly complete 18S rRNA gene sequences of other Theileria spp. 
that have not only been misidentified as T. annulata in the GenBank™, but are 
also published as T. annulata. Moreover, a high level of sequence conservation 
was noticed in the 18S rRNA gene of true T. annulata and T. orientalis 
sequences."
184,"BACKGROUND: AT1 receptor gene (AGTR1) is related to essential hypertension (EH), 
and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and arterial stiffness are common 
complications of EH. This study aimed to explore the association between AGTR1 
genotype and LVH and arterial stiffness in EH patients.
METHODS: A total of 179 EH patients were recruited in this study. Oral 
exfoliated cells were collected from each patient, and the genetic polymorphism 
of AGTR1(rs4524238) was assessed using a gene sequencing platform. The outcomes 
were LVH and arterial stiffness.
RESULTS: Among 179 patients, 114 were with AGTR1 genotype of GG (57 males, aged 
59.54 ± 13.49 years) and 65 were with AGTR1 genotype of GA or AA (36 males, aged 
61.28 ± 12.79 years). Patients with AGTR1 genotype of GG were more likely to 
have LVH (47 [41.23%] vs. 14 [21.54%], P = 0.006) and arterial stiffness (30 
[26.32%] vs. 8 [12.31%], P = 0.036). The AGTR1 polymorphism frequency was in 
accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.291). The multivariate 
logistic regression showed that AGTR1 genotype of GA or AA was independently 
associated with lower risk of LVH (OR = 0.344, 95%CI 160~0.696, P = 0.003) and 
arterial stiffness (OR = 0.371, 95%CI 0.155~0.885, P = 0.025) after adjusting 
for gender, age, and diabetes.
CONCLUSION: EH patients with the AGTR1 genotype of GA or AA were at lower risk 
for LVH and arterial stiffness than those with the GG genotype."
185,"Race-nonspecific resistance is a key to sustainable management of pathogens in 
bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding. It is more durable compared to 
race-specific immunity, conferred by the major genes (R), which are often 
overcome by pathogens. The accumulation of the genes, which provide the 
resistance to a specific race of a pathogen, together with the introduction of 
race-non-specific resistance genes is the most effective strategy aimed at 
preventing the breakdown of genetically conditioned immunity. PCR markers 
improved the productivity and accuracy of classical plant breeding by means of 
marker-assisted selection (MAS). Multiplexing assays provide increased 
throughput, reduced reaction cost, and conservation of limited sample material, 
which are beneficial for breeding purposes. Here, we described the process of 
customizing multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous identification of the major 
leaf rust resistance genes Lr19, Lr24, Lr26, and Lr38, as well as the slow 
rusting, race-nonspecific resistance genes: Lr34 and Lr68, in thirteen 
combinations. The adaptation of PCR markers for multiplex assays relied on: (1) 
selection of primers with an appropriate length; (2) selection of common 
annealing/extension temperature for given primers; and (3) PCR mixture 
modifications consisting of increased concentration of primers for the scanty 
band signals or decreased concentration of primers for the strong bands. These 
multiplex PCR protocols can be integrated into a marker-assisted selection of 
the leaf rust-resistant wheat genotypes."
186,"Biofilms are cell assemblies embedded in an exopolysaccharide matrix formed by 
microorganisms of a single or many different species. This matrix in which they 
are embedded protects the bacteria from external influences and antimicrobial 
effects. The biofilm structure that microorganisms form to protect themselves 
from harsh environmental conditions and survive is found in nature in many 
different environments. These environments where biofilm formation occurs have 
in common that they are in contact with fluids. The gene expression of bacteria 
in complex biofilm differs from that of bacteria in the planktonic state. The 
differences in biofilm cell expression are one of the effects of community life. 
Means of quorum sensing, bacteria can act in coordination with each other. At 
the same time, while biofilm formation provides many benefits to bacteria, it 
has positive and negative effects in many different areas. Depending on where 
they occur, biofilms can cause serious health problems, contamination risks, 
corrosion, and heat and efficiency losses. However, they can also be used in 
water treatment plants, bioremediation, and energy production with microbial 
fuel cells. In this review, the basic steps of biofilm formation and biofilm 
regulation in the model organism Escherichia coli were discussed. Finally, the 
methods by which biofilm formation can be detected and monitored were briefly 
discussed."
187,"Sperm cells are target cells for both estrogens and xenoestrogens. Due to the 
specific structure of spermatozoa, these hormonal compounds may act on sperm in 
a non-genomic mechanism only. However, the ESR-mediated signaling pathways are 
still poorly understood. In this study, we obtained 119 samples from male 
participants of Caucasian descent who donated semen for standard analysis. We 
analyzed gene expression of estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) and their 
coregulators-proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1), and 
cellular kinase c-Src (SRC). RNA level was established using reverse-transcribed 
RNA as a template, followed by a polymerase chain reaction. Proteins' presence 
was confirmed by western blot and immunocytochemistry techniques. ""Normal"" 
values of semen parameters were defined as follows: > 32% sperm with progressive 
motility, > 4% sperm cells with normal morphology, > 15 × 106 sperm per 
mL, > 58% live spermatozoa and leukocyte amount < 106 cells per mL, according to 
WHO 2010 reference. Semen parameters that deviated from these ""normal"" values 
were labeled as ""abnormal"". Gene expression ratios revealed significant, 
moderate, and negative correlations for ESR1/ESR2 and weak, negative ESR2/PELP1 
correlations in the subgroup of patients with abnormal values of semen 
parameters. In addition, SRC/PELP1 was moderately and positively correlated in 
the subgroup with parameters within the reference values established by WHO 
2010. Our study showed that both PELP1 scaffolding protein and SRC kinase might 
influence semen quality via ESRs. It seems that not the expression of a single 
gene may affect the sperm quality, but more gene-to-gene mutual ratio. 
Characterization of estrogen-signaling pathway-related genes' modulated 
expression in sperm cells could aid in better understanding sperm biology and 
quality."
188,"PET imaging using radiolabeled amino acids in addition to MRI has become a 
valuable diagnostic tool in the clinical management of patients with brain 
tumors. This review provides a comprehensive overview of PET studies in glioma 
patients with a mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene (IDH). A 
considerable fraction of these tumors typically show no contrast enhancement on 
MRI, especially when classified as grade 2 according to the World Health 
Organization classification of Central Nervous System tumors. Major diagnostic 
challenges in this situation are differential diagnosis, target definition for 
diagnostic biopsies, delineation of glioma extent for treatment planning, 
differentiation of treatment-related changes from tumor progression, and the 
evaluation of response to alkylating agents. The main focus of this review is 
the role of amino acid PET in this setting. Furthermore, in light of clinical 
trials using IDH inhibitors targeting the mutated IDH enzyme for treating 
patients with IDH-mutant gliomas, we also aim to give an outlook on PET probes 
specifically targeting the IDH mutation, which appear potentially helpful for 
response assessment."
189,"PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate a cohort of female and male patients with 
idiopathic central precocious puberty (CPP), negative for Makorin Ring Finger 
Protein 3 (MKRN3) defect, by molecular screening for Delta-like 1 homolog (DLK1) 
defects. DLK1 is an imprinted gene, whose mutations have been described as a 
rare cause of CPP in girls and adult women with precocious menarche, obesity and 
metabolic derangement.
METHODS: We enrolled 14 girls with familial CPP and 13 boys with familial or 
sporadic CPP from multiple academic hospital centers. Gene sequencing of DLK1 
gene was performed. Circulating levels of DLK1 were measured and clinical and 
biochemical characteristics were described in those with DLK1 defects.
RESULTS: A novel heterozygous mutation in DLK1, c.288_289insC (p.Cys97Leufs*16), 
was identified in a male proband, his sister and their father. Age at onset of 
puberty was in line with previous reports in the girl and 8 years in the boy. 
The father with untreated CPP showed short stature. No metabolic derangement was 
present in the father except hypercholesterolemia. Undetectable Dlk1 serum 
levels indicated the complete lack of protein production in the three affected 
patients.
CONCLUSION: A DLK1 defect has been identified for the first time in a boy, 
underscoring the importance of genetic testing in males with idiopathic or 
sporadic CPP. The short stature reported by his untreated father suggests the 
need for timely diagnosis and treatment of subjects with DLK1 defects."
190,"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been widely adopted as a tool for measuring 
common variant liability and they have been shown to predict lifetime risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. However, the relationship between PRS and 
AD pathogenesis is largely unknown. To this end, we performed a 
differential gene-expression and associated disrupted biological pathway 
analyses of AD PRS vs. case/controls in human brain-derived cohort sample 
(cerebellum/temporal cortex; MayoRNAseq). The results highlighted already 
implicated mechanisms: immune and stress response, lipids, fatty acids and 
cholesterol metabolisms, endosome and cellular/neuronal death, being disrupted 
biological pathways in both case/controls and PRS, as well as previously less 
well characterised processes such as cellular structures, mitochondrial 
respiration and secretion. Despite heterogeneity in terms of differentially 
expressed genes in case/controls vs. PRS, there was a consensus of commonly 
disrupted biological mechanisms. Glia and microglia-related terms were also 
significantly disrupted, albeit not being the top disrupted Gene Ontology terms. 
GWAS implicated genes were significantly and in their majority, up-regulated in 
response to different PRS among the temporal cortex samples, suggesting 
potential common regulatory mechanisms. Tissue specificity in terms of disrupted 
biological pathways in temporal cortex vs. cerebellum was observed in relation 
to PRS, but limited tissue specificity when the datasets were analysed as 
case/controls. The largely common biological mechanisms between a case/control 
classification and in association with PRS suggests that PRS stratification can 
be used for studies where suitable case/control samples are not available or the 
selection of individuals with high and low PRS in clinical trials."
191,"Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous 
micro-deletion in the WS critical region (WSCR) and is characterized by 
hyper-sociability and neurocognitive abnormalities. Nonetheless, whether and to 
what extent WSCR deletion leads to epigenetic modifications in the brain and 
induces pathological outcomes remains largely unknown. By examining DNA 
methylation in frontal cortex, we revealed genome-wide disruption in the 
methylome of individuals with WS, as compared to typically developed (TD) 
controls. Surprisingly, differentially methylated sites were predominantly 
annotated as introns and intergenic loci and were found to be highly enriched 
around binding sites for transcription factors that regulate neuronal 
development, plasticity and cognition. Moreover, by utilizing enhancer-promoter 
interactome data, we confirmed that most of these loci function as active 
enhancers in the human brain or as target genes of transcriptional networks 
associated with myelination, oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation, cognition and 
social behavior. Cell type-specific methylation analysis revealed aberrant 
patterns in the methylation of active enhancers in neurons and OLs, and 
important neuron-glia interactions that might be impaired in individuals with 
WS. Finally, comparison of methylation profiles from blood samples of 
individuals with WS and healthy controls, along with other data collected in 
this study, identified putative targets of endophenotypes associated with WS, 
which can be used to define brain-risk loci for WS outside the WSCR locus, as 
well as for other associated pathologies. In conclusion, our study illuminates 
the brain methylome landscape of individuals with WS and sheds light on how 
these aberrations might be involved in social behavior and physiological 
abnormalities. By extension, these results may lead to better diagnostics and 
more refined therapeutic targets for WS."
192,"Development of colorectal cancer (CRC) is regulated by a series of genetic and 
microenvironmental alterations. Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) is a secreted 
glycoprotein that is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and 
modulates inflammation. However, the role of OLFM4 in CRC is uncertain. Here we 
aimed to explore the function of OLFM4 in CRC in vivo and in vitro. The mRNA 
expression of OLFM4 was up-regulated in precursor lesions with dysplasia or 
ulcerative colitis but was reduced in CRC. OLFM4 neutralizing antibody 
suppressed inflammation-mediated early-stage CRC formation in an AOM/DSS 
colitis-associated cancer model. OLFM4 knockdown cells exhibited increased cell 
proliferation and motility in vitro and in vivo. Ablation of OLFM4 increased 
tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft experiments. In addition, OLFM4 
knockdown cells showed elevated expression of colon cancer stem cell markers 
including CD133, resulting in increased metastasis via epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition signaling. This study demonstrated that OLFM4 regulates inflammation 
and cancer progression differently; ablation of OLFM4 promotes cancer metastasis 
via stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results suggest a new 
route for controlling cancer progression and metastasis."
193,"BACKGROUND: Thyroid hormones play a vital function in the maturation in the 
course of mind development. Regarding the well-known effects of choline on 
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the study examined the effects of 
choline on hippocampal BDNF gene expression in maternal hypothyroidism rats.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To induce the hypothyroidism, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil was 
introduced to the ingesting water from the sixth day of gestation to 
twenty-first postnatal day (PND). Choline-treatment started twice a day on the 
first day of gestation until PND 21. On PND28, pups were sacrificed. The 
expression of BDNF gene was evaluated after the hippocampus was harvested. Our 
results demonstrated that both male and female pre-pubertal offspring rats' BDNF 
gene expression was decreased by developmental hypothyroidism. Choline increases 
the ratio of relative gene expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of males and 
females in the control/hypothyroidism group, especially in males.
CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that maternal choline supplementation on the 
first day of gestation until PND 21 improves brain development and cognitive 
function in pre-pubertal offspring rats regarding control/hypothyroidism groups."
194,"INTRODUCTION: Variants in the BRCA1/2 genes are responsible for familial breast 
cancer. Numerous studies showed a different spectrum of BRCA variants among 
breast cancer patients of different Ethnicity origin. In the available 
literature, no previous research has focused on breast cancer-associated 
variants among the Khakass people (the indigenous people of the Russian 
Federation).
METHODS: Twenty-six Khakass breast cancer patients were enrolled in the study. 
Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and used to prepare libraries using 
a Hereditary Cancer Solution kit. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed 
using the MiSeq System (Illumina, USA).
RESULTS: In our study, 12% of patients (3/26) carried a single pathogenic 
variant; 54% of patients (14/26) carried variants of uncertain significance 
(VUS) or conflicting variants; and 35% of patients (9/26) did not carry any 
clinically significant variants. Germline pathogenic variant in the ATM gene 
(rs780619951, NC_000011.10:g.108259022C > T) was identified in two unrelated 
patients with a family history of cancer (7.6%, 2/26). The pathogenic truncating 
variant in the ATM gene (p. R805* or c.2413C > T) leads to the nonfunctional 
version of the protein. This variant has been earlier reported in individuals 
with a family history of breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study describes the germline variant in the ATM gene 
associated with breast cancer in Khakass women of North Asia."
195,"Gene expression studies offer promising opportunities to better understand the 
processes underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD). As cell types differ in their 
function, gene expression profiles will typically vary across cell types. When 
studying bulk tissue, failure to account for this cellular diversity has a 
detrimental impact on the ability to detect disease associations. We therefore 
assayed the transcriptomes of 32,531 individual nuclei extracted from the 
nucleus accumbens (NAc) of nine donors with AUD and nine controls (72% male). 
Our study identified 17 clearly delineated cell types. We detected 26 
transcriptome-wide significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that mainly 
involved medium spiny neurons with both D1-type and D2-type dopamine receptors, 
microglia (MGL) and oligodendrocytes. A higher than expected number of DEGs 
replicated in an existing single nucleus gene expression study of alcohol 
dependence in the prefrontal cortex (enrichment ratio 1.91, p value 0.019) with 
two genes remaining significant after a Bonferroni correction. Our most 
compelling result involved CD53 in MGL that replicated in the same cell type in 
the prefrontal cortex and was previously implicated in studies of DNA 
methylation, bulk gene expression and genetic variants. Several DEGs were 
previously reported to be associated with AUD (e.g., PER1 and MGAT5). The DEGs 
for MSN.3 seemed involved in neurodegeneration, disruption of circadian rhythms, 
alterations in glucose metabolism and changes in synaptic plasticity. For MGL, 
the DEGs implicated neuroinflammation and immune-related processes and for OLI, 
disruptions in myelination. This identification of the specific cell-types from 
which the association signals originate will be key for designing proper 
follow-up experiments and, eventually, novel clinical interventions."
196,"Smoking is a serious public health issue linked to more than 8 million deaths 
per year worldwide and may lead to nicotine dependence (ND). Although the 
epigenomic literature on smoking is well established, studies evaluating the 
role of epigenetics in ND are limited. In this study, we examined the epigenomic 
signatures of ND and how these differ from smoking exposure to identify 
biomarkers specific to ND. We investigated the peripheral epigenetic profile of 
smoking status (SS) and ND in a US male veteran cohort. DNA from saliva was 
collected from 1135 European American (EA) male US military veterans. DNAm was 
assessed using the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. SS 
was evaluated as current smokers (n = 137; 12.1%) and non-current smokers (never 
and former; n = 998; 87.9%). NDFTND was assessed as a continuous variable using 
the Fagerström Test for ND (FTND; n = 1135; mean = 2.54 ± 2.29). Epigenome-wide 
association studies (EWAS) and co-methylation analyses were conducted for SS and 
NDFTND . A total of 450 and 22 genome-wide significant differentially methylated 
sites (DMS) were associated with SS and NDFTND , respectively (15 overlapped 
DMS). We identified 97 DMS (43 genes) in SS-EWAS previously reported in the 
literature, including AHRR and F2RL3 genes (p-value: 1.95 × 10-83 to 
4.55 × 10-33 ). NDFTND novel DMS mapped to NEUROG1, ANPEP, and SLC29A1. 
Co-methylation analysis identified 386 modules (11 SS-related and 19 NDFTND 
-related). SS-related modules showed enrichment for alcoholism, while NDFTND 
-related modules were enriched for nicotine addiction. This study confirms 
previous findings associated with SS and identifies novel and-potentially 
specific-epigenetic biomarkers of ND that may inform prognosis and novel 
treatment strategies."
197,"BACKGROUND: Hox genes encode transcription factors that are important for 
establishing the body plan. Hoxa5 is a member of the mammalian Hox5 paralogous 
group that regulates the patterning and morphology of the cervical-thoracic 
region of the axial skeleton. Hoxa5 also plays crucial functions in lung 
morphogenesis.
RESULTS: We generated a Hoxa5eGFP reporter mouse line using CRISPR technology, 
allowing real-time visualization of Hoxa5 expression. Hoxa5eGFP recapitulates 
reported embryonic Hoxa5 mRNA expression patterns. Specifically, Hoxa5eGFP can 
be visualized in the developing mouse neural tube, somites, lung, diaphragm, 
foregut, midgut, among other organs. In the stomach, posteriorly biased 
Hoxa5eGFP expression correlates with a drastic morphological reduction of the 
corpus in Hox5 paralogous mutants. Expression of Hoxa5eGFP in the lung continues 
in all lung fibroblast populations through postnatal and adult stages.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified cell types that express Hoxa5 in postnatal and adult 
mouse lungs, including various fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells. This 
reporter line will be a powerful tool for studies of the function of Hoxa5 
during mouse development, homeostasis, and disease processes. This article is

198,"O-linked β-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) is a ubiquitous 
posttranslational modification occurring in both animals and plants. Thousands 
of proteins along with their O-GlcNAcylation sites have been identified in 
various animal systems, yet the O-GlcNAcylated proteomes in plants remain poorly 
understood. Here, we report a large-scale profiling of protein O-GlcNAcylation 
in a site-specific manner in rice. We first established the metabolic glycan 
labeling strategy (MGL) with N-azidoacetylgalactosamine (GalNAz) in rice 
seedlings, which enabled incorporation of azides as a bioorthogonal handle into 
O-GlcNAc. By conjugation of the azide-incorporated O-GlcNAc with alkyne-biotin 
containing a cleavable linker via click chemistry, O-GlcNAcylated proteins were 
selectively enriched for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. A total of 1,591 
unambiguous O-GlcNAcylation sites distributed on 709 O-GlcNAcylated proteins 
were identified. Additionally, 102 O-GlcNAcylated proteins were identified with 
their O-GlcNAcylation sites located within a serine/threonine-enriched peptide, 
causing ambiguous site assignment. The identified O-GlcNAcylated proteins are 
involved in multiple biological processes such as transcription, translation and 
plant hormone signaling. Furthermore, we discovered two O-GlcNAc transferases 
(OsOGTs) in rice. By expressing OsOGTs in Escherichia coli and Nicotiana 
benthamiana leaves, we confirmed their OGT enzymatic activities and used them to 
validate the identified rice O-GlcNAcylated proteins. Our dataset provides a 
valuable resource for studying O-GlcNAc biology in rice, and the MGL method 
should facilitate the identification of O-GlcNAcylated proteins in various 
plants."
199,"RNA interference (RNAi)-based technologies are starting to be commercialized as 
a new approach for agricultural pest control. Horizontally transferred genes 
(HTGs), which have been transferred into insect genomes from viruses, bacteria, 
fungi, or plants, are attractive targets for RNAi-mediated pest control. HTGs 
are often unique to a specific insect family or even genus, making it unlikely 
that RNAi constructs targeting such genes will have negative effects on 
ladybugs, lacewings, and other beneficial predatory insect species. In this 
study, we sequenced the genome of a red, tobacco-adapted isolate of Myzus 
persicae (green peach aphid) and bioinformatically identified 30 HTGs. We then 
used plant-mediated virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to show that several 
HTGs of bacterial and plant origin are important for aphid growth and/or 
survival. Silencing the expression of fungal-origin HTGs did not affect aphid 
survivorship but decreased aphid reproduction. Importantly, although there was 
uptake of plant-expressed RNA by Coccinella septempunctata (seven-spotted 
ladybugs) via the aphids that they consumed, we did not observe negative effects 
on ladybugs from aphid-targeted VIGS constructs. To demonstrate that this 
approach is more broadly applicable, we also targeted five Bemisia tabaci 
(whitefly) HTGs using VIGS and demonstrated that knockdown of some of these 
genes affected whitefly survival. As functional HTGs have been identified in the 
genomes of numerous pest species, we propose that these HTGs should be explored 
further as efficient and safe targets for control of insect pests using 
plant-mediated RNA interference."
200,"Cost and availability have often dictated the use of heterologous/alien 
prolactins in experiments, particularly in vivo. The assumption has been that 
what is initiated in the target cell is representative of the homologous hormone 
since many heterologous mammalian prolactins bind to and activate rodent 
receptors. Here, we examined gene expression in mouse liver in response to a 
7-day treatment with recombinant mouse prolactin (mRecPRL), recombinant ovine 
prolactin (oRecPRL) and pituitary extract ovine prolactin (oPitPRL). Having 
established mouse ribosomal protein S9 as the most stable reference gene in the 
liver in the absence and presence of prolactin treatment, we examined expression 
of the two most highly expressed prolactin receptors (PRLRs) and three members 
of the Cyp3a group of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes by qRTPCR. For short form (SF) 
3 PRLR, mRecPRL doubled expression while for oRecPRL and oPitPRL expression was 
only 1.3-fold control. For the long form (LF) PRLR, changes were similar to 
those seen for SF 3 PRLR, such that the SF3:LF PRLR ratio remained the same. 
Expression of the Cyp3as was also dependent on the prolactin origin and, 
although mRecPRL always stimulated, the other PRLs caused varying results. 
Compared to control, Cyp3a16 was stimulated 12-fold by mRecPRL, 3-fold by 
oRecPRL, and 6-fold by oPitPRL. For Cyp3a41, mRecPRL was 3.7-fold control, 
oRecPRL was without effect, and oPitPRL was 2-fold control. Importantly, for 
Cyp3a44, mRecPRL stimulated 2-fold, whereas both oRecPRL and oPitPRL had an 
opposite, inhibitory effect, with expression at 0.5-fold control. We conclude 
that homologous hormone had the largest stimulatory effect on expression of all 
measured genes and that by contrast heterologous hormone showed reduced 
activity, no activity, or opposite activity, depending on the gene being 
analyzed. Thus, experimentation using alien heterologous PRL may lead to 
inaccurate conclusions."
201,"Myoepithelial carcinomas (MECs) of soft tissue are rare and aggressive tumors 
affecting young adults and children, but their molecular landscape has not been 
comprehensively explored through genome sequencing. Here, we present the 
whole-exome sequencing (WES), whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and RNA sequencing 
findings of two MECs. Patients 1 and 2 (P1, P2), both male, were diagnosed at 27 
and 37 yr of age, respectively, with shoulder (P1) and inguinal (P2) soft tissue 
tumors. Both patients developed metastatic disease, and P2 died of disease. P1 
tumor showed a rhabdoid cytomorphology and a complete loss of INI1 (SMARCB1) 
expression, associated with a homozygous SMARCB1 deletion. The tumor from P2 
showed a clear cell/small cell morphology, retained INI1 expression and strong 
S100 positivity. By WES and WGS, tumors from both patients displayed low tumor 
mutation burdens, and no targetable alterations in cancer genes were detected. 
P2's tumor harbored an EWSR1::KLF15 rearrangement, whereas the tumor from P1 
showed a novel ASCC2::GGNBP2 fusion. WGS evidenced a complex genomic event 
involving mainly Chromosomes 17 and 22 in the tumor from P1, which was 
consistent with chromoplexy. These findings are consistent with previous reports 
of EWSR1 rearrangements (50% of cases) in MECs and provide a genetic basis for 
the loss of SMARCB1 protein expression observed through immunohistochemistry in 
10% of 40% of MEC cases. The lack of additional driver mutations in these tumors 
supports the hypothesis that these alterations are the key molecular events in 
MEC evolution. Furthermore, the presence of complex structural variant patterns, 
invisible to WES, highlights the novel biological insights that can be gained 
through the application of WGS to rare cancers."
202,"We present the case of a 53-yr-old woman with an inherited bone marrow failure 
coexisting with uncommon extrahematological symptoms, such as cirrhosis and skin 
abnormalities. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond 
syndrome (SDS) with an atypical presentation. Unexpected was the age of disease 
expression, normally around the pediatric age, with a predominantly median 
survival age of 36 yr. To our knowledge, she was the first adult patient with a 
molecular diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond in Uruguay. The patient was referred to 
our service when she was 43-yr-old with a history of bone marrow failure with 
anemia and thrombocytopenia. All secondary causes of pancytopenia were excluded. 
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens were hypocellular for the patient's 
age. Numerous dysplastic features were observed in the three lineages. She had a 
normal karyotype and normal chromosomal fragility. A diagnosis of low-risk 
hypoplastic MDS was made. Dermatological examination revealed reticulate skin 
pigmentation with hypopigmented macules involving the face, neck, and 
extremities; nail dystrophy; premature graying; and thin hair. 
Extrahematological manifestations were present (e.g., learning difficulties, 
short stature). Last, she was diagnosed with cryptogenic liver cirrhosis CHILD 
C. This rules out all other possible causes of chronic liver disease. This 
clinical presentation initially oriented the diagnosis toward telomeropathy, so 
we did a telomeropathy NGS panel that came up negative. Finally, we did an exome 
sequencing that confirmed the diagnosis of SDS. Using whole-exome sequencing, we 
were able to find two compound heterozygous mutations in the SBDS gene that were 
responsible for the phenotype of a patient that was undiagnosed for 10 years. An 
earlier genetic diagnosis could have influenced our patient's outcome."
203,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been approved in 
malignancies associated with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants, such 
as breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancer. In malignancies not 
associated with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants, the therapeutic 
relevance of PARP inhibitors is less clear. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
is known to demonstrate somatic alterations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. The current 
report is on a gentleman with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with a somatic 
BRCA2 pathogenic variant, who was effectively treated with olaparib. 
Furthermore, we discuss the existing data for use of PARP inhibitors in NSCLC. 
This study highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing in identifying 
gene mutations and demonstrates how such information can be used to select 
targeted therapies in patients with actionable molecular alterations."
204,"Short tandem repeats (STRs) contribute significantly to genetic diversity in 
humans, including disease-causing variation. While the effect of STR variation 
on gene expression has been extensively assessed, their impact on epigenetics 
has been poorly studied and limited to specific genomic regions. Here, we 
investigated the hypothesis that some STRs act as independent regulators of 
local DNA methylation in the human genome, and modify risk of common human 
traits. To address these questions, we first analyzed two independent datasets 
comprising PCR-free whole genome sequencing (WGS) and genome-wide DNA 
methylation levels derived from whole blood samples in 245 (discovery cohort) 
and 484 individuals (replication cohort). Utilizing genotypes for 131,635 
polymorphic STRs derived from WGS using HipSTR, we identified 11,870 STRs that 
associated with DNA methylation levels (mSTRs) of 11,774 CpGs (Bonferroni 
p<0.001) in our discovery cohort, with 90% successfully replicating in our 
second cohort. Subsequently, through fine-mapping using CAVIAR we defined 585 of 
these mSTRs as the likely causal variants underlying the observed associations 
(fm-mSTRs), and linked a fraction of these to previously reported genome-wide 
association study signals, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying 
complex human traits. Furthermore, by integrating gene expression data, we 
observed that 12.5% of the tested fm-mSTRs also modulate expression levels of 
nearby genes, reinforcing their regulatory potential. Overall, our findings 
expand the catalog of functional sequence variants that affect genome 
regulation, highlighting the importance of incorporating STRs in future genetic 
association analysis and epigenetics data for the interpretation of 
trait-associated variants."
205,"Although germline cells are considered to be functionally ""immortal"", both the 
germline and supporting somatic cells in the gonad within an organism will 
experience aging. With increased age at parenthood, the age-related decline in 
reproductive success has become an important biological issue for an aging 
population. However, molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive aging across 
sexes in vertebrates remain poorly understood. To decipher molecular drivers of 
vertebrate gonadal aging across sexes, we perform longitudinal characterization 
of the gonadal transcriptome throughout lifespan in the naturally short-lived 
African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri). By combining mRNA-seq and 
small RNA-seq from 26 individuals, we characterize the aging gonads of young 
adult, middle-aged, and old female and male fish. We analyze changes in 
transcriptional patterns of genes, transposable elements (TEs), and piRNAs. We 
find that testes seem to undergo only marginal changes during aging. In 
contrast, in middle-aged ovaries, the timepoint associated with peak female 
fertility in this strain, PIWI pathway components are transiently downregulated, 
TE transcription is elevated, and piRNA levels generally decrease, suggesting 
that egg quality may already be declining at middle-age. Furthermore, we show 
that piRNA ping-pong biogenesis declines steadily with age in ovaries, while it 
is maintained in aging testes. To our knowledge, this dataset represents the 
most comprehensive transcriptomic dataset for vertebrate gonadal aging. This 
resource also highlights important pathways that are regulated during 
reproductive aging in either ovaries or testes, which could ultimately be 
leveraged to help restore aspects of youthful reproductive function."
206,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possibility of gene therapy in patients with 
inherited ocular conditions and established genetic diagnosis. The secondary 
objectives were to determine the genetic diagnostic rate and to update the list 
of genes for which there are ongoing clinical trials or preclinical studies that 
could allow for gene therapy.
METHODS: Observational, retrospective, multicentric study of 177 patients with 
inherited ocular conditions that underwent genetic testing.
RESULTS: Of 177 patients with genetic testing, 146 were enrolled for this study. 
Disease-causing variants were identified in 117 patients (variant detection rate 
of 80.1%). Pathogenic variants were found in 47 genes, with ABCA4 being the most 
common gene (17.9%), followed by CRB1 (11.9%). 64.1% of patients with a genetic 
diagnosis have a variant in genes for which gene therapy has been studied and 
only 40.1% have a variant in genes with studies for gene therapy in clinical 
phase.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing has opened new horizons in the management of 
patients with hereditary ocular diseases. About two-thirds of the patients had 
pathogenic variants in genes for which gene therapy has been evaluated. However, 
many studies are in the pre-clinical phase. The expectations of patients 
undergoing genetic study and their families should be managed accordingly."
207,"OBJECTIVE: We undertook this study to examine the functional basis for epistasis 
between endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) and HLA-B27 in 
experimental spondyloarthritis (SpA).
METHODS: ERAP1-knockout rats were created using genome editing and bred with 
HLA-B27/human β2 -microglobulin-transgenic (HLA-B27-Tg) rats and HLA-B7-Tg rats. 
The effects of ERAP1 deficiency on HLA allotypes were determined using 
immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, flow cytometry, allogeneic T cell 
proliferation assays, and gene expression analyses. Animals were examined for 
clinical features of disease, and tissue was assessed by histology.
RESULTS: ERAP1 deficiency increased the ratio of folded to unfolded (β2 m-free) 
HLA-B27 heavy chains, while having the opposite effect on HLA-B7. Furthermore, 
in rats with ERAP1 deficiency, HLA-B27 misfolding was reduced, while free 
HLA-B27 heavy chain dimers on the cell surface and monomers were increased. The 
effects of ERAP1 deficiency persisted during up-regulation of HLA-B27 and led to 
a reduction in endoplasmic reticulum stress. ERAP1 deficiency reduced the 
prevalence of arthritis in HLA-B27-Tg rats by two-thirds without reducing 
gastrointestinal inflammation. Dendritic cell abnormalities attributed to the 
presence of HLA-B27, including reduced allogeneic T cell stimulation and loss of 
CD103-positive/major histocompatibility complex class II-positive cells, were 
not rescued by ERAP1 deficiency, while excess Il23a up-regulation was mitigated.
CONCLUSION: ERAP1 deficiency reduced HLA-B27 misfolding and improved folding 
while having opposing effects on HLA-B7. The finding that HLA-B27-Tg rats had 
partial protection against SpA in this study is consistent with genetic evidence 
that loss-of-function and/or reduced expression of ERAP1 reduces the risk of 
ankylosing spondylitis. Functional studies support the concept that the effects 
of ERAP1 on HLA-B27 and SpA may be a consequence of how peptides affect the 
biology of this allotype rather than their role as antigenic determinants."
208,"INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer. As metastasis and 
recurrence are main causes of CRC death, it is of great significance to find 
prognostic biomarkers.
METHODS: Data related to CRC were collected from GEO database. The patients were 
grouped based on clinical information, and the differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) were obtained by differential analysis. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment 
analyses were conducted based on DEGs. Cox combined with LASSO regression 
analysis was applied to screen out the key genes that used to build the 
prognostic model. Survival curve and receiver operating characteristic curve 
were employed to evaluate the validity and reliability of the model. Cox 
regression analysis was applied to determine the independence of risk score. 
GSEA and GSVA analyses were performed on patients with different risks according 
to the risk model scores, and the prognostic nomogram was plotted combined with 
clinical data. Also, qRT-PCR was applied to examine the expression status of the 
screened signatures in clinical cases.
RESULTS: We obtained 302 DEGs by dividing CRC patients into early-stage and 
advanced-stage groups. The results of enrichment analyses demonstrated that the 
DEGs were mainly concentrated in tissues of extracellular matrix, epithelial 
cell proliferation, and cell adhesion-related pathways. Regression identified 9 
hub genes notably correlated with prognosis, including CLK1, SLC2A3, LIPG, 
EPHB2, ATOH1, PLCB4, GZMB, CKMT2, and CXCL11. The validation of the risk model 
proved that the risk model was accurate and could independently determine the 
prognosis of patients. Finally, differences were found in pathway activity of 
extracellular matrix secretion, plaque secretion, Notch signaling pathway, and 
tight junctions in high-risk and low-risk patients. In addition to LIPG and 
CKMT2, other feature genes were notably overexpressed in CRC tumor tissues.
CONCLUSION: The results proved that the expression levels of the 9 biomarkers 
could be used to predict the prognosis of CRC patients."
209,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in numerous common diseases as 
well as aging and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sensorineural 
hearing loss (SNHL). In the current study, we showed that supplementation with 
germanium dioxide (GeO2) in CBA/J mice resulted in SNHL due to the degeneration 
of the stria vascularis and spiral ganglion, which were associated with 
down-regulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain associated genes and 
up-regulation in apoptosis associated genes in the cochlea. Supplementation with 
taurine, coenzyme Q10, or hydrogen-rich water, attenuated the cochlear 
degeneration and associated SNHL induced by GeO2. These results suggest that 
daily supplements or consumption of antioxidants, such as taurine, coenzyme Q10, 
and hydrogen-rich water, may be a promising intervention to slow SNHL associated 
with mitochondrial dysfunction."
210,"The strains designed PP-18T, JC-4 and JC-7 isolated from soils, were 
Gram-stain-positive rods, facultative anaerobe, endospore-forming bacteria. The 
strains produced l-lactic acid from glucose. They showed positive for catalase 
but negative for oxidase, nitrate reduction and arginine hydrolysis. Strains 
P-18T, JC-4 and JC-7 were closely related to Weizmannia coagulans LMG 6326T 
(97.27-97.64%) and W. acidiproducens KCTC 13078T (96.46-96.74%) based on 16S 
rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively. They contained meso-diaminopimelic 
acid in cell wall peptidoglycan and had seven isoprene units (MK-7) as the 
predominant menaquinone. The major cellular fatty acids of strain PP-18T were 
iso-C15:0, anteiso-C17:0, iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C15:0. The ANIb and ANIm values 
among the genomes of strains PP-18T, JC-4 and JC-7 are above 99.4% while their 
ANIb and ANIm values among them and W. coagulans LMG 6326T and W. acidiproducens 
KCTC 13078T were ranged from 76.61 to 79.59%. These 3 strains showed the digital 
DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values of 20.7-23.6% when compared with W. 
coagulans LMG 6326T and W. acidiproducens DSM 23148T. The DNA G + C contents of 
strains PP-18T, JC-4 and JC-7 were 45.82%, 45.86% and 45.86%, respectively. The 
major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and 
phosphoglycolipids. The results of phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics 
and whole-genome analysis indicated that the strains PP-18T, JC-4 and JC-7 
should be represented as a novel species within the genus Weizmannia for which 
the name Weizmannia acidilactici sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is PP-18T 
(=KCTC 33974T = NBRC 113028T = TISTR 2515T)."
211,"HOXA9 is commonly upregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where it confers 
poor prognosis. Characterising the protein interactome of endogenous HOXA9 in 
human AML, we identified a chromatin complex of HOXA9 with the nuclear matrix 
attachment protein-SAFB. SAFB perturbation phenocopied HOXA9 knockout to 
decrease AML proliferation, increase differentiation and apoptosis in vitro and 
prolonged survival in vivo. Integrated genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic 
analyses further demonstrated that the HOXA9-SAFB-chromatin complex associates 
with NuRD and HP1g to repress the expression of factors associated with 
differentiation and apoptosis, including NOTCH1, CEBPd, S100A8, and CDKN1A. 
Chemical or genetic perturbation of NuRD and HP1g -associated catalytic activity 
also triggered differentiation, apoptosis and the induction of these 
tumor-suppressive genes. Importantly, this mechanism is operative in other 
HOXA9-dependent AML genotypes. This mechanistic insight demonstrates active 
HOXA9-dependent differentiation block as a potent mechanism of disease 
maintenance in AML, that may be amenable to therapeutic intervention via 
therapies targeting the HOXA9/SAFB interface and/or NuRD and HP1g activity."
212,"Aim: To identify genes associated with the prognosis of head and neck squamous 
cell carcinoma (HNSC) and potential molecular targets for therapy. Materials and 
Methods: Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, Human Protein Atlas, 
University of ALabama at Birmingham CANcer, LinkedOmics, cBioPortal, Cell 
Counting Kit 8, and polymerase chain reaction were used in this study. Results: 
The expression level of nuclear transport factor 2 (NUTF2) was elevated in HNSC 
tissues and was associated with poor prognosis in HNSC patients. NUTF2-targeted 
intervention inhibited the proliferation of HNSC cells. SEC61G, which was 
positively correlated with NUTF2, was decreased in HNSC cells with NUTF2 
suppression. Conclusions: NUTF2 may be correlated with the prognosis and 
development of HNSC, laying the foundation for future studies on the potential 
role of NUTF2 in HNSC."
213,"Background: Conventional newborn screening (NBS) is usually based on biochemical 
methods to predict the risk of inborn errors of metabolism. Recent studies have 
applied next-generation sequencing in NBS and revealed much more information, 
including carrier status. Whether these carriers of variants differ from other 
individuals was not fully determined. Objective: This research investigated the 
effect of heterozygous carrier status of pathogenic variants on biochemical 
indicators during NBS. Methods: We enrolled newborns participating in both 
conventional NBS and our previous Newborn Screening with Targeted Sequencing 
(NESTS) program from January 2021 to December 2021 in the Shunyi Maternal and 
Children's Hospital of Beijing Children's Hospital. Newborn levels of 
phenylalanine (Phe), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and 
17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) were measured to be analyzed together with 
associated sequencing results. Results: A total of 2351 newborns in the NESTS 
program was examined in the study. None had biallelic variants in genes related 
to congenital hypothyroidism (CH), hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) or congenital 
adrenal hyperplasia. Forty-nine heterozygous carriers with phenylalanine 
hydroxylase (PAH) variants had significantly higher levels of Phe (p < 0.0001), 
and 11 heterozygous carriers of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) 
variants had significantly higher levels of TSH (p < 0.05). Although 
heterozygous carriers had higher biochemical levels, they were below the 
diagnostic threshold of HPA and CH. Conclusions: Carriers of heterozygous 
variants in PAH or TSHR had significantly increased biochemical levels of 
associated factors in NBS. For individuals with higher Phe or TSH levels within 
the normal reference intervals, attention should be paid to the possibility of 
heterozygous carrier status."
214,"Purpose: To explore the genetic defects in two Chinese families with X-linked 
Norrie disease (ND). Methods: We analyzed two Chinese families with ND at 
molecular level through clinical exome sequencing and the variations were 
identified by Sanger sequencing. Results: Two genetic variations were found in 
the NDP gene by clinical exome sequencing, a partial deletion of 801 bp 
contained the whole exon 2 and a missense variant (164G>A) within codon 55 that 
resulted in the interchange of cysteine by phenylalanine. Clinical findings were 
more severe in the patients who presented the missense variant. Conclusion: We 
report two genetic variations in the NDP gene in Chinese that extend the 
mutational and phenotypic spectra of NDP gene, and also demonstrate the 
feasibility of clinical exome sequencing in application of molecular diagnosis."
215,"The availability of proteomics datasets in the public domain, and in the PRIDE 
database, in particular, has increased dramatically in recent years. This 
unprecedented large-scale availability of data provides an opportunity for 
combined analyses of datasets to get organism-wide protein abundance data in a 
consistent manner. We have reanalyzed 24 public proteomics datasets from healthy 
human individuals to assess baseline protein abundance in 31 organs. We defined 
tissue as a distinct functional or structural region within an organ. Overall, 
the aggregated dataset contains 67 healthy tissues, corresponding to 3,119 mass 
spectrometry runs covering 498 samples from 489 individuals. We compared protein 
abundances between different organs and studied the distribution of proteins 
across these organs. We also compared the results with data generated in 
analogous studies. Additionally, we performed gene ontology and 
pathway-enrichment analyses to identify organ-specific enriched biological 
processes and pathways. As a key point, we have integrated the protein abundance 
results into the resource Expression Atlas, where they can be accessed and 
visualized either individually or together with gene expression data coming from 
transcriptomics datasets. We believe this is a good mechanism to make proteomics 
data more accessible for life scientists."
216,"Humic substances (HS) are the most abundant forms of natural organic matter on 
the earth surface. Comprised of decomposed plant and animal materials rich in 
carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur complexes, HS facilitate global 
carbon and nitrogen cycling and the transport of anthropogenic contaminants. 
While it is known that HS also interact with organisms at different trophic 
levels to produce beneficial and harmful effects whether HS exert these 
biological effects through accumulation remains unknown. Current radiolabeling 
techniques, which only detect the amount of accumulated radiolabels, cannot 
visualize the transport and accumulation behavior of HS. Here, using a 
label-free method based on pump-probe microscopy, we show HS entered the 
protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila, zebrafish embryos, and human cells and 
exerted direct effects on these organisms. HS accumulated in the nucleus of T. 
thermophila, chorion pore canals of zebrafish embryos, and nucleus of intestinal 
and lung cells in a concentration- and time-dependent way. Epigenetic and 
transcriptomics assays show HS altered chromatin accessibility and gene 
transcription in T. thermophila. In zebrafish larvae, HS induced neurotoxicity, 
altering spontaneous muscle contraction and locomotor activity. Detailed images 
showing HS accumulation in our study reveal new insights on the ecological and 
environmental behavior of HS."
217,"Single-cell whole-transcriptome analysis is the gold standard approach to 
identifying molecularly defined cell phenotypes. However, this approach cannot 
be used for dynamics measurements such as live-cell imaging. Here, we developed 
a multifunctional robot, the automated live imaging and cell picking system 
(ALPS) and used it to perform single-cell RNA sequencing for microscopically 
observed cells with multiple imaging modes. Using robotically obtained data that 
linked cell images and the whole transcriptome, we successfully predicted 
transcriptome-defined cell phenotypes in a noninvasive manner using cell 
image-based deep learning. This noninvasive approach opens a window to determine 
the live-cell whole transcriptome in real time. Moreover, this work, which is 
based on a data-driven approach, is a proof of concept for determining the 
transcriptome-defined phenotypes (i.e., not relying on specific genes) of any 
cell from cell images using a model trained on linked datasets."
218,"The nuclear long non-coding RNA LUCAT1 has previously been identified as a 
negative feedback regulator of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine 
expression in human myeloid cells. Here, we define the mechanistic basis for the 
suppression of inflammatory gene expression by LUCAT1. Using comprehensive 
identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry as well as RNA 
immunoprecipitation, we identified proteins important in processing and 
alternative splicing of mRNAs as LUCAT1-binding proteins. These included 
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C, M, and A2B1. Consistent with this 
finding, cells lacking LUCAT1 have altered splicing of selected immune genes. In 
particular, upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation, the splicing of the nuclear 
receptor 4A2 (NR4A2) gene was particularly affected. As a consequence, 
expression of NR4A2 was reduced and delayed in cells lacking LUCAT1. 
NR4A2-deficient cells had elevated expression of immune genes. These 
observations suggest that LUCAT1 is induced to control the splicing and 
stability of NR4A2, which is in part responsible for the anti-inflammatory 
effect of LUCAT1. Furthermore, we analyzed a large cohort of patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease as well as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease. In these patients, LUCAT1 levels were elevated and in both diseases, 
positively correlated with disease severity. Collectively, these studies define 
a key molecular mechanism of LUCAT1-dependent immune regulation through 
post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs highlighting its role in the regulation 
of inflammatory disease."
219,"Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are a heterogeneous group of 
cells with expansion, differentiation, and repopulation capacities. How HSPCs 
orchestrate the stemness state with diverse lineage differentiation at steady 
condition or acute stress remains largely unknown. Here, we show that zebrafish 
mutants that are deficient in an epigenetic regulator Atf7ip or Setdb1 
methyltransferase undergo excessive myeloid differentiation with impaired HSPC 
expansion, manifesting a decline in T cells and erythroid lineage. We find that 
Atf7ip regulates hematopoiesis through Setdb1-mediated H3K9me3 modification and 
chromatin remodeling. During hematopoiesis, the interaction of Atf7ip and Setdb1 
triggers H3K9me3 depositions in hematopoietic regulatory genes including cebpβ 
and cdkn1a, preventing HSPCs from loss of expansion and premature 
differentiation into myeloid lineage. Concomitantly, loss of Atf7ip or Setdb1 
derepresses retrotransposons that instigate the viral sensor Mda5/Rig-I like 
receptor (RLR) signaling, leading to stress-driven myelopoiesis and 
inflammation. We find that ATF7IP or SETDB1 depletion represses human leukemic 
cell growth and induces myeloid differentiation with retrotransposon-triggered 
inflammation. These findings establish that Atf7ip/Setdb1-mediated H3K9me3 
deposition constitutes a genome-wide checkpoint that impedes the myeloid 
potential and maintains HSPC stemness for diverse blood cell production, 
providing unique insights into potential intervention in hematological 
malignancy."
220,"Cephalotaxines harbor great medical potential, but their natural source, the 
endemic conifer Cephalotaxus is highly endangered, creating a conflict between 
biotechnological valorization and preservation of biodiversity. Here, we 
construct the whole biosynthetic pathway to the 1-phenethylisoquinoline 
scaffold, as first committed compound for phenylethylisoquinoline alkaloids 
(PIAs), combining metabolic modeling, and transcriptome mining 
of Cephalotaxus hainanensis to infer the biosynthesis for PIA precursor. We 
identify a novel protein, ChPSS, driving the Pictet-Spengler condensation and 
show that this enzyme represents the branching point where PIA biosynthesis 
diverges from the concurrent benzylisoquinoline-alkaloids pathway. We also 
pinpoint ChDBR as crucial step to form 4-hydroxydihydrocinnamaldehyde diverging 
from lignin biosynthesis. The elucidation of the early PIA pathway represents an 
important step toward microbe-based production of these pharmaceutically 
important alkaloids resolving the conflict between biotechnology and 
preservation of biodiversity."
221,"Decline in mitochondrial function underlies aging and age-related diseases, but 
the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in these processes remains 
elusive. To investigate patterns of mtDNA mutations, it is particularly 
important to quantify mtDNA mutations and their associated pathogenic effects at 
the single-cell level. However, existing single-cell mtDNA sequencing approaches 
remain inefficient due to high cost and low mtDNA on-target rates. In this 
study, we developed a cost-effective mtDNA targeted-sequencing protocol called 
single-cell sequencing by targeted amplification of multiplex probes (scSTAMP) 
and experimentally validated its reliability. We then applied our method to 
assess single-cell mtDNA mutations in 768 B lymphocytes and 768 monocytes from a 
76-y-old female. Across 632 B lymphocyte and 617 monocytes with medium mtDNA 
coverage over >100×, our results indicated that over 50% of cells carried at 
least one mtDNA mutation with variant allele frequencies (VAFs) over 20%, and 
that cells carried an average of 0.658 and 0.712 such mutation for B lymphocytes 
and monocytes, respectively. Surprisingly, more than 20% of the observed 
mutations had VAFs of over 90% in either cell population. In addition, over 60% 
of the mutations were in protein-coding genes, of which over 70% were 
nonsynonymous, and more than 50% of the nonsynonymous mutations were predicted 
to be highly pathogenic. Interestingly, about 80% of the observed mutations were 
singletons in the respective cell populations. Our results revealed mtDNA 
mutations with functional significance might be prevalent at advanced age, 
calling further investigation on age-related mtDNA mutation dynamics at the 
single-cell level."
222,"Background: High frequency of Helicobacter pylori infection and the unknown mode 
of transmission prompted us to investigate H. pylori-wild housefly relationship. 
H. pylori causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and stomach cancer. H. pylori 
persists in the gut of the experimentally infected houseflies. The existence of 
H. pylori strains isolated from wild houseflies, on the other hand, has never 
been documented. Methods: In this study, 902 wild houseflies from different 
sites were identified as Musca domestica, then 60 flies were screened by 
traditional microbiological techniques and H. pylori-specific 16S rRNA gene. The 
antibiotic resistance (ART) was investigated phenotypically. Wild housefly gut 
bacterial isolates were further evaluated genotypically to have 23S rRNA gene 
mutation related to clarithromycin resistance. To find efficient therapeutic 
alternatives, the potency of three plant extracts (garlic, ginger, and lemon) 
and the wasp, Vespa orientalis venom was evaluated against H. pylori. The 
cytotoxic effect of the crude wasp venom, the most potent extract, against Vero 
and Colon cancer (Caco2) cell lines was investigated using the 
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Results: All 
isolates from houseflies were positive. The isolated bacteria have variable 
resistance to frequently used antibiotics in all isolates. Minimum inhibitory 
concentration values of 15.625 mg/mL for both ginger and lemon extracts, 
7.8125 mg/mL for garlic extract, and 0.0313 mg/mL for wasp venom were recorded. 
Wasp venom has the most potent antibacterial activity compared with the four 
antibiotics that are currently used in therapies against H. pylori. Conclusion: 
We conclude that wild houseflies can play a role in disseminating H. pylori. The 
housefly gut may be a suitable environment for the horizontal transfer of ART 
genes among its associated microbiome and H. pylori. Wasp venom proved its 
potential activity as a new and effective anti-H. pylori drug for both 
therapeutic and preventative usage."
223,"Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria isolated from food animals pose a major health 
threat to the public on this planet. This study aimed to determine the 
susceptibility profiles of Escherichia coli isolated from cattle and pig fecal 
samples and investigate the molecular characteristics of extended-spectrum 
β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli using gene identification, conjugation, and 
Southern blot approach. Overall 293 E. coli were recovered from cattle (120 
isolates) and pigs (173 isolates) in 7 provinces of Korea during 2017-2018. 
Ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and sulfisoxazole resistance rates 
were the highest in pigs' isolates (>60%, p ≤ 0.001) compared to that in cattle 
(3-39%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was higher in pig isolates (73%) than in 
cattle (31%), and the MDR profile usually includes streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, 
and tetracycline. Resistance to critically important antimicrobials such as 
ceftiofur, colistin, and ciprofloxacin was higher in weaners than those from 
finishers in pigs. The qnrS gene was detected in 13% of the pig isolates. Eight 
isolates from pigs and one isolate from cattle were identified as ESBL-producers 
and ESBL genes belonged to blaCTX-M-55 (n = 4), blaCTX-M-14 (n = 3), and 
blaCTX-M-65 (n = 2). Notably, the blaCTX-M-65 and qnrS1 genes were found to be 
carried together in an identical plasmid (IncHI2) in two isolates from finisher 
pigs. The blaCTX-M-carrying isolates belonged to phylogenetic groups B1 (n = 4), 
B2 (n = 2), A (n = 2), and D (n = 1). The blaCTX-M genes and non-β-lactam 
resistance traits were transferred to the E. coli J53 recipient from seven 
blaCTX-M-positive strains isolated from pigs. The blaCTX-M genes belonged to the 
IncI1α, IncFII, and IncHI2 plasmids and are also associated with the ISEcp1, 
IS26, IS903, and orf477 elements. These findings suggested the possibility of 
blaCTX-M-carrying E. coli transmission to humans through direct contact with 
cattle and pigs or contamination of food products."
224,"Background: Patients with osteoporosis (OP) have a high risk of bone fracture. 
Abnormal bone mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) differentiation is an essential 
process of OP development. In recent years, photobiomodulation has been shown to 
effectively promote BMSC proliferation. However, the mechanism by which 
photobiomodulation promotes BMSC proliferation is unclear. Long noncoding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) are essential mediators in multiple biological processes. The lncRNA 
maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is a novel lncRNA gene and is related to cell 
proliferation. Studies have indicated that MEG3 serves as a promotor in BMSC 
proliferation. Objective: To investigate the effects and mechanisms of 800 nm 
light-emitting diode (LED) photobiomodulation in BMSC proliferation. Materials 
and methods: The BMSCs collected from mouse tibias and femurs were irradiated by 
800 nm LED for 180 sec. CCK-8 assay was used to detect the cell viability. A 
dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine IncRNA MEG3 acted as a 
miR-217-5p sponge. We used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) and western blot to detect the mRNA and protein levels of MEG3, 
miR-217-5p, Notch2, Hes1, Hey2. Results: In the present study, we revealed that 
photobiomodulation (800 nm LED) could increase the mRNA level of MEG3, and 
protein levels of Notch2, Hes1, and Hey2. Moreover, we also identified that 
upregulated MEG3 could act as a miR-217-5p sponge to activate the Notch 
signaling pathway. Conclusions: The current study revealed the MEG3-related 
mechanism of photobiomodulation treatment in OP and identified potential gene 
therapies for OP."
225,"A pulldown using a biotinylated natural product of interest in the 
17β-hydroxywithanolide (17-BHW) class, physachenolide C (PCC), identified the 
bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family of proteins (BRD2, BRD3, and 
BRD4), readers of acetyl-lysine modifications and regulators of gene 
transcription, as potential cellular targets. BROMOscan bromodomain profiling 
and biochemical assays support PCC as a BET inhibitor with increased selectivity 
for bromodomain (BD)-1 of BRD3 and BRD4, and X-ray crystallography and NMR 
studies uncovered specific contacts that underlie the potency and selectivity of 
PCC toward BRD3-BD1 over BRD3-BD2. PCC also displays characteristics of a 
molecular glue, facilitating proteasome-mediated degradation of BRD3 and BRD4. 
Finally, PCC is more potent than other withanolide analogues and gold-standard 
pan-BET inhibitor (+)-JQ1 in cytotoxicity assays across five prostate cancer 
(PC) cell lines regardless of androgen receptor (AR)-signaling status."
226,"OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for most deaths in patients 
with type 1 diabetes (T1D); however, the determinants of plaque composition are 
unknown. miRNAs regulate gene expression, participate in the development of 
atherosclerosis, and represent promising CVD biomarkers. This study analyzed the 
circulating miRNA expression profile in T1D with either carotid calcified (CCP) 
or fibrous plaque (CFP).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Circulating small noncoding RNAs were sequenced and 
quantified using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatic analysis in an 
exploratory set of 26 subjects with T1D with CCP and in 25 with CFP. Then, in a 
validation set of 40 subjects with CCP, 40 with CFP, and 24 control subjects 
with T1D, selected miRNA expression was measured by digital droplet PCR. 
Putative gene targets enriched for pathways implicated in 
atherosclerosis/vascular calcification/diabetes were analyzed. The patients' 
main clinical characteristics were also recorded.
RESULTS: miR-503-5p, let-7d-5p, miR-106b-3p, and miR-93-5p were significantly 
upregulated, while miR-10a-5p was downregulated in patients with CCP compared 
with CFP (all fold change >±1.5; P < 0.05). All candidate miRNAs showed a 
significant correlation with LDL-cholesterol, direct for the upregulated and 
inverse for the downregulated miRNA, in CCP. Many target genes of upregulated 
miRNAs in CCP participate in osteogenic differentiation, apoptosis, 
inflammation, cholesterol metabolism, and extracellular matrix organization.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings characterize miRNAs and their signature in the 
regulatory network of carotid plaque phenotype in T1D, providing new insights 
into plaque pathophysiology and possibly novel biomarkers of plaque composition."
227,"Water present on early Mars is often assumed to have been habitable. In this 
study, experiments were performed to investigate the habitability of 
well-defined putative martian fluids and to identify the accompanying potential 
formation of biosignatures. Simulated martian environments were developed by 
combining martian fluid and regolith simulants based on the chemistry of the 
Rocknest sand shadow at Gale Crater. The simulated chemical environment was 
inoculated with terrestrial anoxic sediment from the Pyefleet mudflats (United 
Kingdom). These enrichments were cultured for 28 days and subsequently 
subcultured seven times to ensure that the microbial community was solely grown 
on the defined, simulated chemistry. The impact of the simulated chemistries on 
the microbial community was assessed by cell counts and sequencing of 16S rRNA 
gene profiles. Associated changes to the fluid and precipitate chemistries were 
established by using ICP-OES, IC, FTIR, and NIR. The fluids were confirmed as 
habitable, with the enriched microbial community showing a reduction in 
abundance and diversity over multiple subcultures relating to the selection of 
specific metabolic groups. The final community comprised sulfate-reducing, 
acetogenic, and other anaerobic and fermentative bacteria. Geochemical 
characterization and modeling of the simulant and fluid chemistries identified 
clear differences between the biotic and abiotic experiments. These differences 
included the elimination of sulfur owing to the presence of sulfate-reducing 
bacteria and more general changes in pH associated with actively respiring cells 
that impacted the mineral assemblages formed. This study confirmed that a system 
simulating the fluid chemistry of Gale Crater could support a microbial 
community and that variation in chemistries under biotic and abiotic conditions 
can be used to inform future life-detection missions."
228,"Linezolid has been reported to restore erythromycin susceptibility in 
erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This phenomenon has not been 
reported in enterococci and the mechanisms involved therein are still unknown. 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms involved and the 
effect of combining linezolid with erythromycin on erythromycin-resistant 
enterococci. Checkerboard techniques were used to determine drug interactions, 
and 12 of 14 isolates showed a synergistic effect between erythromycin and 
linezolid (fractional inhibitory concentration <0.5). We observed that the 
erm(B) gene, which encodes a dimethyltransferase responsible for erythromycin 
resistance, was expressed from transposon Tn1545 in the tested 
erythromycin-resistant enterococci. After exposure to linezolid, erm(B)-mediated 
rRNA dimethylation at A2071 could not be detected, and the erm(B) gene was lost 
following acquisition of erythromycin susceptibility. Thus, in conclusion, 
linezolid combined with erythromycin exerts a synergistic effect against 
erythromycin-resistant enterococci. Linezolid treatment suppressed 
erm(B)-mediated rRNA dimethylation at A2071, which could lead to loss of the 
erm(B) gene."
229,"In accord with International Conference on Harmonization S7B guidelines, an in 
vitro human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay is one component of an 
integrated risk assessment for delayed ventricular repolarization. Function of 
hERG could be affected by direct (acute) mechanisms, or by indirect (chronic) 
mechanisms. Some approved oligonucleotide therapeutics had submitted hERG data 
to regulatory agents, which were all collected with the same protocol used for 
small-molecule testing (incubation time <20 min; acute), however, 
oligonucleotides have unique mechanisms and time courses of action (indirect). 
To reframe the hERG testing strategy for silencing RNA (siRNA), an investigation 
was performed to assess the time course for siRNA-mediated inhibition of hERG 
function and gene expression. Commercially available siRNAs of hERG were 
evaluated in a stable hERG-expressed cell line by whole-cell voltage clamp using 
automated electrophysiology and polymerase chain reaction. In the acute hERG 
study, no effects were observed after treatment with 100 nM siRNA for 20 min. 
The chronic effects of 100 nM siRNAs on hERG function were evaluated and 
recorded over 8-48 h following transfection. At 8 h there was no significant 
effect, whereas 77% reduction was observed at 48 h. Measurement of hERG mRNA 
levels demonstrated a 79% and 93% decrease of hERG mRNA at 8 and 48 h, 
respectively, consistent with inhibition of hERG transcription. The results 
indicate that an anti-hERG siRNA requires a long exposure time (48 h) in the 
hERG assay to produce a maximal reduction in hERG current; short exposures 
(20 min-8 h) had no effect. These findings imply that off-target profiling of 
novel oligonucleotides could benefit from using hERG protocol with long 
incubation times to de-risk potential off-target (indirect) effects on the hERG 
channel. This hERG assay modification may be important to consider if the 
findings are used to support an integrated nonclinical-clinical risk assessment 
for QTc (the duration of the QT interval adjusted for heart rate) prolongation."
230,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is an established risk factor for colorectal cancer 
(CRC). However, genetically-defined population subgroups may have increased 
susceptibility to smoking-related effects on CRC.
METHODS: A genome-wide interaction scan was performed including 33,756 CRC cases 
and 44,346 controls from three genetic consortia.
RESULTS: Evidence of an interaction was observed between smoking status (ever vs 
never smokers) and a locus on 3p12.1 (rs9880919, p=4.58x10-8), with higher 
associated risk in subjects carrying the GG genotype (OR 1.25, 95%CI 1.20-1.30) 
compared with the other genotypes (OR <1.17 for GA and AA). Among ever smokers, 
we observed interactions between smoking intensity (increase in 10 cigarettes 
smoked per day) and two loci on 6p21.33 (rs4151657, p=1.72x10-8) and 8q24.23 
(rs7005722, p=2.88x10-8). Subjects carrying the rs4151657 TT genotype showed 
higher risk (OR 1.12, 95%CI 1.09-1.16) compared with the other genotypes (OR 
<1.06 for TC and CC). Similarly, higher risk was observed among subjects 
carrying the rs7005722 AA genotype (OR 1.17, 95%CI 1.07-1.28) compared with the 
other genotypes (OR <1.13 for AC and CC). Functional annotation revealed that 
SNPs in 3p12.1 and 6p21.33 loci were located in regulatory regions, and were 
associated with expression levels of nearby genes. Genetic models predicting 
gene expression revealed that smoking parameters were associated with lower CRC 
risk with higher expression levels of CADM2 (3p12.1) and ATF6B (6p21.33).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified novel genetic loci that may modulate the risk 
for CRC of smoking status and intensity, linked to tumor suppression and immune 
response.
IMPACT: These findings can guide potential prevention treatments."
231,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3 (ERK3) is a poorly characterized member 
of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family. Functional analysis of the 
ERK3 signaling pathway has been hampered by a lack of knowledge about the 
substrates and downstream effectors of the kinase. Here, we used large-scale 
quantitative phosphoproteomics and targeted gene silencing to identify direct 
ERK3 substrates and gain insight into its cellular functions. Detailed 
validation of one candidate substrate identified the gelsolin/villin family 
member supervillin (SVIL) as a bona fide ERK3 substrate. We show that ERK3 
phosphorylates SVIL on Ser245 to regulate myosin II activation and cytokinesis 
completion in dividing cells. Depletion of SVIL or ERK3 leads to increased 
cytokinesis failure and multinucleation, a phenotype rescued by wild type SVIL 
but not by the non-phosphorylatable S245A mutant. Our results unveil a new 
function of the atypical MAP kinase ERK3 in cell division and the regulation of 
cell ploidy."
232,"DNA sequence information has revealed many morphologically cryptic species 
worldwide. For animals, DNA-based assessments of species diversity usually rely 
on the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. However, a 
growing amount of evidence indicate that mitochondrial markers alone can lead to 
misleading species diversity estimates due to mito-nuclear discordance. 
Therefore, reports of putative species based solely on mitochondrial DNA should 
be verified by other methods, especially in cases where COI sequences are 
identical for different morphospecies or where divergence within the same 
morphospecies is high. Freshwater amphipods are particularly interesting in this 
context because numerous putative cryptic species have been reported. Here, we 
investigated the species status of the numerous mitochondrial molecular 
operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) found within Echinogammarus sicilianus. We 
used an integrative approach combining DNA barcoding with mate selection 
observations, detailed morphometrics and genome-wide double digest restriction 
site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq). Within a relatively small sampling 
area, we detected twelve COI MOTUs (divergence = 1.8-20.3%), co-occurring in 
syntopy at two-thirds of the investigated sites. We found that pair formation 
was random and there was extensive nuclear gene flow among the ten MOTUs 
co-occurring within the same river stretch. The four most common MOTUs were also 
indistinguishable with respect to functional morphology. Therefore, the evidence 
best fits the hypothesis of a single, yet genetically diverse, species within 
the main river system. The only two MOTUs sampled outside the focal area were 
genetically distinct at the nuclear level and may represent distinct species. 
Our study reveals that COI-based species delimitation can significantly 
overestimate species diversity, highlighting the importance of integrative 
taxonomy for species validation, especially in hyperdiverse complexes with 
syntopically occurring mitochondrial MOTUs."
233,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with familial early-onset dementia (EOD) pose a unique 
opportunity for gene identification studies.
METHODS: We present the phenotype and whole-exome sequencing (WES) study of an 
autosomal dominant EOD family. Candidate genes were examined in a set of 
dementia cases and controls (n = 3712). Western blotting was conducted of the 
wild-type and mutant protein of the final candidate.
RESULTS: Age at disease onset was 60 years (range 56 to 63). The phenotype 
comprised mixed amnestic and behavioral features, and parkinsonism. 
Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma biomarkers, and a positron emission tomography 
amyloid study suggested Alzheimer's disease. WES and the segregation pattern 
pointed to a nonsense mutation in the TRIM25 gene (p.C168*), coding for an E3 
ubiquitin ligase, which was absent in the cohorts studied. Protein studies 
supported a loss-of-function mechanism.
DISCUSSION: This study supports a new physiopathological mechanism for brain 
amyloidosis. Furthermore, it extends the role of E3 ubiquitin ligases 
dysfunction in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.
HIGHLIGHTS: A TRIM25 nonsense mutation (p.C168*) is associated with autosomal 
dominant early-onset dementia and parkinsonism with biomarkers suggestive of 
Alzheimer's disease. TRIM25 protein studies support that the mutation exerts its 
effect through loss of function. TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is known for 
its role in the innate immune response but this is the first report of 
association with neurodegeneration. The role of TRIM25 dysfunction in 
development of amyloidosis and neurodegeneration merits a new line of research."
234,"Ancient DNA (aDNA) studies have deployed genetic material from archaeological 
contexts to investigate human dispersals and interactions, corroborating some 
longstanding hypotheses and revealing new aspects of human history. After 
drawing the broad genomic strokes of human history, geneticists have discovered 
the exciting possibilities of applying this method to answer questions on a 
smaller scale. This review provides an overview of the commonly used methods, 
both in the laboratory and the analyses, and summarizes the current state of 
genomic research. It reviews human dispersals across the continents and 
additionally highlights some studies that integrated genomics to answer 
questions beyond biology to understand the cultural and societal traits of past 
societies. By shining a light from multiple angles, we gain a much better 
understanding of the real shape of the human past."
235,"3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (OPAC) are 
the predominant catabolites of quercetin glycosides, such as quercetin 
4'-O-β-glucoside from the onion, produced by intestinal microbiota. Although 
each catabolite has been reported to protect the cells from acetaldehyde-induced 
cytotoxicity, the effect of their combination remains to be clarified. The 
purpose of this study was to determine whether the combination of DOPAC and OPAC 
enhances the resistance against the acetaldehyde-induced oxidative stress in the 
cultured hepatocytes. The pretreatment of the combination of DOPAC (5 μM) and 
OPAC (5 μM) showed the significant protection against the acetaldehyde- and 
hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity, even though each compound at the same 
concentration did not. This combination also significantly inhibited the 
intracellular dichlorofluorescin diacetate-detectable reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) level, whereas the solo treatment did slightly, suggesting that reducing 
mechanisms of ROS or compounds that enhance ROS production are involved in the 
cytoprotective effect. The combinatory treatment significantly enhanced the gene 
expression of not only the aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), but also 
glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit, the first rate-limiting enzyme of 
glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Accordingly, both the intracellular GSH level and 
the total ALDH activity were enhanced by DOPAC plus OPAC. Involvement of GSH in 
the cytoprotection as well as ALDH up-regulation by the combination were 
confirmed by the experiments using a GSH biosynthesis inhibitor, buthionine 
sulfoximine. Taken together, the present results suggested that the quercetin 
microbiota catabolites concertedly protect the cells from acetaldehyde through a 
pre-enhanced resistance against oxidative stress by the GSH-dependent 
up-regulation of ALDHs."
236,"Background: Anaplasma ovis are obligate intracellular bacteria that can endanger 
human and animal health, and they can be transmitted by arthropod vectors, such 
as Melophagus ovinus and ticks. Materials and Methods: In this study, 433 
specimens, including 370 M. ovinus and 63 sheep blood samples, were collected 
from nine districts of South Xinjiang to investigate the distribution and 
molecular epidemiology of A. ovis in M. ovinus and small ruminant. Results: DNA 
of A. ovis was detected in 109 (25.2%, 109/433) of the 433 samples using PCR and 
sequencing. The analysis of A. ovis msp4 sequences revealed four different 
genotypes, including genotype III (47.7%; 52/109), GB3 (34.0%; 37/109), AoGOv3 
(15.6%; 17/109), and XJ9 (2.8%; 3/109). Conclusions: To the best of our 
knowledge, A. ovis genotypes GB3, AoGOv3, and XJ9 detected in this study are the 
first to be reported in M. ovinus, and our data indicate that XJ9 is a novel A. 
ovis genotype presented herein for the first time. These findings provide 
important references for the new understanding and prevention of A. ovis in 
border counties in China."
237,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive degeneration of 
dopaminergic neurons leading to reduced locomotion. Mutations of parkin gene in 
Drosophila produce the same phenotypes as vertebrate models, but the effect of 
parkin knockdown on dopamine release is not known. Here, we report 
age-dependent, spatial variation of dopamine release in the brain of parkin-RNAi 
adult Drosophila. Dopamine was repetitively stimulated by local application of 
acetylcholine and quantified by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in the central 
complex or mushroom body heel. In the central complex, the main area controlling 
locomotor function, dopamine release is maintained for repeated stimulations in 
aged control flies, but lower concentrations of dopamine are released in the 
central complex of aged parkin-RNAi flies. In the mushroom body heel, the 
dopamine release decrease in older parkin-RNAi flies is similar to controls. 
There is not significant dopaminergic neuronal loss even in older parkin 
knockdown flies, which indicates that the changes in stimulated dopamine release 
are due to alterations of neuronal function. In young parkin-RNAi flies, 
locomotion is inhibited by 30%, while in older parkin-RNAi flies it is inhibited 
by 85%. Overall, stimulated dopamine release is modulated by parkin in an age 
and brain region dependent manner. Correlating the functional state of the 
dopaminergic system with behavioral phenotypes provides unique insights into the 
PD mechanism. Drosophila can be used to study dopamine functionality in PD, 
elucidate how genetics influence dopamine, and test potential therapies to 
maintain dopamine release."
238,"Broadhead Geoffrey K., Henry E. Wiley, David Peprah, Kenneth Olumba, and Alisa 
T. Thavikulwat. Proliferative retinopathy associated with repeated high-altitude 
exposure in a patient with sickle cell trait. High Alt Med Biol. 23:369-371, 
2022.-Sickle cell trait (SCT), a carrier state characterized by one normal copy 
of the beta-globin gene (producing hemoglobin A) and one abnormal variant 
(producing hemoglobin S), is typically asymptomatic and very low risk for 
manifestations of hemoglobinopathy, including development of retinopathy. 
Reported cases of proliferative retinopathy in patients with SCT have occurred 
in the context of concurrent ocular or systemic disease. We report a case of an 
otherwise healthy patient with SCT who developed proliferative retinopathy 
requiring surgical intervention in the setting of significant exposure to high 
altitude through increased work hours as a flight attendant in the month leading 
to her presentation. Significant high-altitude exposure may contribute to 
development of retinopathy in patients with sickle trait. Practitioners should 
consider the possibility of sickle cell retinopathy in patients with sickle 
trait in these circumstances."
239,"Chitinase-like proteins (CLPs) are members of the family 18 glycosyl hydrolases, 
which include chitinases and the enzymatically inactive CLPs. A mutation in the 
enzyme's catalytic site, conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates, allowed 
CLPs to evolve independently with functions that do not require chitinase 
activity. CLPs normally function during inflammatory responses, wound healing, 
and host defense, but when they persist at excessive levels at sites of chronic 
inflammation and in tissue-remodeling disorders, they correlate positively with 
disease progression and poor prognosis. Little is known, however, about their 
physiological function. Drosophila melanogaster has six CLPS, termed Imaginal 
disc growth factors (Idgfs), encoded by Idgf1, Idgf2, Idgf3, Idgf4, Idgf5, and 
Idgf6. In this study we developed tools to facilitate characterization of the 
physiological roles of the Idgfs by deleting each of the Idgf genes using the 
CRISPR/Cas9 system and assessing loss-of-function phenotypes. Using null lines, 
we showed that loss-of-function for all six Idgf proteins significantly lowers 
viability and fertility. We also showed that Idgfs play roles in epithelial 
morphogenesis, maintaining proper epithelial architecture and cell shape, 
regulating E-cadherin and cortical Actin, and remarkably, protecting these 
tissues against CO2 exposure. Defining the normal molecular mechanisms of CLPS 
is key to understanding how deviations tip the balance from a physiological to a 
pathological state."
240,"Encyclometra japonica Yoshida and Ozaki, 1929 is a fluke that parasitizes the 
digestive tract of snakes. When the species was first reported, it was 
originally characterized on the basis of morphologic features, namely, the 
characteristics of the 2 testes located obliquely in the anterior-posterior 
direction, and the position of the ventral sucker one-fourth to one-third from 
the anterior extremity. Thereafter, more specimens with other morphologic 
variations were reported, and a new morphologic feature for species 
discrimination was proposed. However, the proposal is uncertain, and the 
criteria for morphologic discrimination between E. japonica and other 
Encyclometra species remain debatable. Thus, morphologically discriminable 
characteristics on the basis of a sufficient number of specimens are required, 
and molecular methods for species identification that allow for a more objective 
assessment need to be established. Therefore, in the present study, nucleotide 
sequences of 18S, 28S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and cytochrome c oxidase 
subunit I (COI) of E. japonica were determined along with detailed morphologic 
observations for the first time. Key characteristics were observed in all 
specimens, whereas some morphologic variations were observed in the symmetry of 
the cecum. The COI sequences, which are known to be variable genetic regions, 
were identical among all specimens; therefore, all of them were considered the 
same species. This result clarifies the high morphologic variation in E. 
japonica. The 18S and 28S sequences were 99.78% and 99.11-99.19% similar to 
those of Encylometra colubrimurorum. The high degree of homology between these 
genes indicates that E. japonica and E. colubrimurorum are closely related but 
independent species. The present data will be used for the identification of E. 
japonica and to evaluate the relationships within the genus Encyclometra."
241,"To explore the effect of different types of dissolved organic matter (DOM) 
decomposition on nutrient cycling pathways and the microbial loop, four lakes 
with different DOM sources were investigated monthly. In Lake Tangxun, 
Dolichospermum decay released highly labile dissolved organic nitrogen into the 
water column. This induced bacterial organic nitrogen decomposition, as 
indicated by the increased abundance of gltB, gltD, gdh, and glnA as well as 
aminopeptidase activity. Genes associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction 
to ammonium further fueled ammonium accumulation, driving Microcystis blooms in 
the summer. In Lake Zhiyin, fish bait deposits (high nitrogen, similar to 
Dolichospermum detritus) also caused Microcystis blooms. Detritus from 
Microcystis decomposition then produced high levels of labile dissolved organic 
phosphorus, inducing phosphatase activity and increasing soluble reactive 
phosphorus concentrations from September to April in Lakes Tangxun and Zhiyin. 
The high refractory DOM from macrophytes in Lake Houguan led to insufficient 
nutrient availability, leading to nutrient mutualism between algae and bacteria. 
The high levels of labile dissolved organic carbon from terrestrial detritus in 
Lake Yandong increased bacterial biomass and production, resulting in low 
chlorophyll content due to the competitive relationship between algal and 
bacterial nutrient requirements. Therefore, different DOM compositions induce 
unique connections among available nutrients, algae, and bacteria in the 
microbial loop."
242,"Basidiomycetes produce a wide variety of sesquiterpenoids, which attract 
significant interest in pharmaceutical and industrial applications. Structural 
diversification of sesquiterpenoids is performed by sesquiterpene synthases 
(STSs), which produce a wide array of backbone structures; therefore, functional 
characterization and increased biocatalyst collection of STSs are important for 
expanding scientific knowledge and meeting the needs of advanced biotechnology. 
Gene identification and functional annotation of STSs from the basidiomycetous 
fungi Agaricus bisporus, Auriscalpium vulgare, Lepista nuda, Pleurotus ostreatus 
and Trametes versicolor were conducted. Through these investigations, the 
catalytic functions of 30 STSs were revealed using recombinant enzymes 
heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, the unique 
function of an STS from P. ostreatus, PoSTS-06, was revealed to be the 
production of a novel sesquiterpene hydrocarbon that we named pleostene. The 
absolute structure of pleostene was determined by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray 
crystallography using the crystalline sponge method."
243,"Transient transcription machineries play important roles in the dynamic

reaction modules consisting of transcription machineries that guide the 
transient synthesis of catalytic DNAzymes, the transient operation of gated 
DNAzymes, and the temporal activation of an intercommunicated DNAzyme cascade. 
The reaction modules rely on functional constituents that lead to the triggered 
activation of transcription machineries in the presence of the nucleoside 
triphosphates oligonucleotide fuel, yielding the transient formation and 
dissipative depletion of the intermediate DNAzyme(s) products. The kinetics of 
the transient DNAzyme networks are computationally simulated, allowing to 
predict and experimentally validate the performance of the systems under 
different auxiliary conditions. The study advances the field of systems 
chemistry by introducing transcription machinery-based networks for the dynamic 
control over transient catalysis─a primary step toward life-like cellular 
assemblies."
244,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a trivalent genetically engineered inactivated Escherichia 
coli vaccine (K88ac-3STa-LTB) that neutralizes the STa toxin by targeting 
fimbriae and entertoxins for the treatment of enterotoxigenic E coli.
ANIMALS: 18- to 22-g mice, rabbits, pregnant sows.
PROCEDURES: Using PCR, the K88ac gene and LTB gene were cloned separately from 
the template C83902 plasmid. At the same time, the 3 STa mutant genes were also 
amplified by using the gene-directed mutation technology. Immune protection 
experiments were performed, and the minimum immune dose was determined in mice 
and pregnant sows.
RESULTS: The ELISA test could be recognized by the STa, LTB, and K88ac 
antibodies. Intragastric administration in the suckling mouse confirmed that the 
protein had lost the toxicity of the natural STa enterotoxin. The results of the 
immune experiments showed that K88ac-3STa-LTB protein could stimulate rabbits to 
produce serum antibodies and neutralize the toxicity of natural STa enterotoxin. 
The efficacy test of the K88ac-3STa-LTB-inactivated vaccine showed that the 
immune protection rate of the newborn piglets could reach 85% on the first day 
after suckling. At the same time, it was determined that the minimum 
immunization doses for mice and pregnant sows were 0.2 and 2.5 mL, respectively.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This research indicates that the K88ac-3STa-LTB trivalent 
genetically engineered inactivated vaccine provides a broad immune spectrum for 
E coli diarrhea in newborn piglets and prepares a new genetically engineered 
vaccine candidate strain for prevention of E coli diarrhea in piglets."
245,"Background: Circular RNAs (circ-RNAs) have been demonstrated to influence 
initiation, drug resistance, and metastasis of tumors. However, the effects of 
circular-phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (circ-PGAM1) on matrine resistance in 
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unknown. Materials and Methods: The 
reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used 
to determine gene expression. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP 
nick end labeling (TUNEL) and cell colony formation assays were used to evaluate 
NSCLC apoptosis and cell proliferation after indicated treatments, respectively. 
Results: circ-PGAM1 was upregulated in human NSCLC cell lines (H1299 and A549) 
compared with the human normal lung epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells. circ-PGAM1 
overexpression reversed the matrine treatment-induced inhibition on 
proliferation of NSCLC cells (A549 and H1299) and rescued the matrine 
treatment-stimulated apoptosis of these cells. miR-326 was demonstrated to 
interact with circ-PGAM1. circ-PGAM1 knockdown enhanced the antitumor effect of 
matrine on NSCLC cell proliferation and apoptosis, which was reversed by miR-326 
inhibition. The authors also identified CXCR5 as a key downstream target of 
miR-326 in A549 cells. Conclusions: circ-PGAM1 enhances matrine resistance of 
NSCLC cells through the miR-326/CXCR5 axis. The authors' findings provide new 
insights into NSCLC-targeted therapy."
246,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Urinary bladder recurrences (UBRs) after radical 
nephroureterectomy (RNUx) are a known challenge in patients with upper-tract 
urothelial cancers (UTUCs). We aim to assess factors associated with UBR and 
clonal-relatedness with resected UTUC.
METHODS: Patients who underwent RNUx for UTUC between 1998 and 2015 in five 
institutions were identified. Clonal relatedness between primary UTUC and 
subsequent UBR in a sub-cohort was assessed using next-generation sequencing. A 
Kaplan-Meier curve was used to assess differences in UBR between two groups 
(with or without ureteroscopic biopsy).
RESULTS: Of 267 patients with complete records, 73 (27.3%) had UBR during 
follow-up. The five-year UBR-free survival in all patients was 64.7%. The 
five-year UBR-free-survival was inferior in patients who underwent URS biopsy 
compared with patients who did not undergo ureteroscopic biopsy (49.9% vs 76.4%, 
p < 0.001). History of bladder tumour (HR, 95% CI; 2.94, 1.73-5.00, p < 0.001), 
ureteroscopic biopsy (HR, 95% CI; 2.21, 1.38-3.53, p = 0.001) and preoperative 
urine cytology ≥C3 (HR, 95% CI; 2.06, 1.24-3.40, p = 0.005) were independently 
associated with UBR. Patients with ureteroscopic biopsy (n = 3/5) showed 
identical mutational changes for common genes (TP53 and FGFR3) between primary 
UTUC and subsequent UBR.
CONCLUSIONS: Ureteroscopic biopsy of UTUC is a significant risk factor for UBR. 
Qualitative clonality assessment showed identical mutational signatures between 
primary UTUC and UBR."
247,"PURPOSE: Dual-specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) inactivates factors in the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, activated in uveal 
melanoma (UM) by mutations in upstream G-protein α subunits GNAQ/11 in >90% 
cases. This study examined whether DUSP4 (1) protein expression in primary UM 
(pUM) was a biomarker of metastatic risk and (2) knockdown sensitized UM cells 
to therapeutic agents, selumetinib or doxorubicin.
METHODS: DUSP4 mRNA data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and DUSP4 protein 
expression examined using immunohistochemistry in 28 cases of pUM were evaluated 
for association with clinical, genetic, and histological features. In vitro 
cytotoxic drug assays tested the efficacy of selumetinib and doxorubicin in UM 
cell lines with/without small interfering RNA DUSP4 gene silencing.
RESULTS: DUSP4 protein expression was observed in 93% of cases, with strong 
nuclear positivity in 79%. Despite higher DUSP4 messenger RNA levels in disomy 
3/wild-type BAP1 UM, there was no significant association of nDUSP4 protein with 
these metastatic risk predictors or outcome. DUSP4 expression in UM cell lines 
varied. DUSP4 silencing in Mel202, MP46, and MP41 cells did not affect ERK1/2 or 
phospho-ERK levels. Despite increased phospho-ERK levels in Mel285, no cell line 
showed enhanced sensitivity to selumetinib/doxorubicin.
CONCLUSIONS: DUSP4 protein expression is not a biomarker of UM metastatic risk. 
DUSP4 plays a complex role in oncogenesis, as reported in other cancers, and 
further work is required to fully understand its functional role in the MAPK 
pathway.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the role of phosphatases, such as DUSP4, 
in the control of intracellular signaling cascades will facilitate our ability 
to identify successful treatment options."
248,"Necroptosis is a promising novel target for cervical cancer therapy. 
Nevertheless, differentially expressed necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) in 
cervical cancer and their associations with prognosis are far from fully 
clarified. In this study, differentially expressed NRGs (DE-NRGs) were screened 
out and their bio-function was elucidated. Subsequently, a prognostic scoring 
model based on the regression coefficients of the screened out NRGs and their 
corresponding mRNA expressions were constructed and validated. Finally, the 
survival probability of cervical cancer patients based on the constructed 
prognostic scoring model in 3 and 5 years was predicted and assessed. We found 
17 DE-NRGs in cervical cancer tissues which were closely related to cancer 
progression, and most of them were significantly highly expressed. Furthermore, 
3 NRG were confirmed as the prognostic signature genes from 17 DE-NRGs by 
regression analysis. Overall survival predicted through our prognostic scoring 
model was lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group (p < 0.05) in 
both the TCGA cohort and the external GEO44001 validation cohort. What's more, 
the prediction performance of our prognostic scoring models well verified by the 
ROC curve, and the risk score calculated could act as an independent prognostic 
factor for cervical cancer patients. The calibration curve and C-index (0.776) 
of the nomogram analysis suggested that the predictive performance of the 
nomogram was satisfactory. Our study identified and validated a 
necroptosis-related prognostic signature in cervical cancer, which could well 
predict the prognosis for cervical cancer patients."
249,"PURPOSE: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) orchestrate critical roles in human 
tumorigenesis. However, the regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs in tissue-specific 
expressions in breast cancer (BC) remains poorly understood. This study aims to 
investigate lncRNA role and mechanisms in BC.
METHODS: RNA sequencing was used to explore differentially expressed lncRNAs in 
BC and adjacent tissues. H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) chromatin 
immune-precipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data of BC cells from the GEO dataset 
(GSE85158) was retrieved to identify the H3K27ac activated lncRNAs that were 
involved in tumorigenesis. RP11-162G10.5 was selected as the target lncRNA for 
further functional and mechanism study.
RESULTS: In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA RP11-162G10.5, whose 
overexpression was specifically driven by H3K27ac in luminal breast cancer. And 
increased RP11-162G10.5 in BC is correlated with poor patient outcomes. 
RP11-162G10.5 promotes tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. 
Mechanistically, RP11-162G10.5 recruits transcriptional factor YBX1 to the GLO1 
promoter, consequently activating GLO1 transcription to modulate the progression 
of BC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the histone modification-activated lncRNA 
contributes to the oncogenesis of BC. Also, our data reveal a role for 
RP11-162G10.5 in BC tumorigenesis and may supply a strategy for targeting the 
RP11-162G10.5 as a potential biomarker and a therapeutic target for breast 
cancer patients."
250,"Ceroid lipofuscinosis type 3 (CLN3) is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative 
metabolic disease. Typical clinical symptoms include progressive visual loss, 
epilepsy of unknown etiology and dementia. Presence of lipofuscin deposits with 
typical pattern of 'fingerprints' and vacuolized lymphocytes suggest the 
diagnosis of CLN3. Cause of CLN3 are mutations in the CLN3 gene, among which the 
most frequently found is the large deletion 1.02 kb spreading on exons 7 and 8. 
We present 4 patients from 2 families, in whom the deterioration of visual 
quality and acuity was observed as first clinical sign, when they were a few 
years old and it was successively accompanied by symptoms of neurologic 
deterioration (like generalized convulsions with consciousness impairment). In 
all patients the 1.02 kb deletion in the CLN3 gene was detected in homo- or 
heterozygosity with other CLN3 pathogenic variant. Ultrastructural studies 
revealed abnormal structures corresponding to 'fingerprint' profiles (FPPs) in 
conjunctival endothelial cells. It should be emphasized that in patients with 
blindness of unknown cause the diagnosis of ceroid lipofuscinosis should be 
considered and in older children-especially CLN3. The facility of the analysis 
for the presence of 1.02 kb deletion and economic costs are a solid argument for 
intensive use of this test in the diagnostic procedure of CLN3."
251,"PURPOSE: This study aims to examine the expression of autophagic genes and 
proteins during blastocyst development and differentiation.
METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study. Between March 2018 and November 
2019, 30 females aged 30.13 ± 4.83 years underwent an intracytoplasmic sperm 
injection (ICSI) cycle at Madina Fertility Center. ICSI was used to develop and 
incubate 82 leftover embryos to day 5. Then, the embryos were divided into two 
groups based on their developmental structure: group D (n = 49) included embryos 
that developed into blastocysts, whereas group A (n = 33) included arrested 
embryos. These embryos were used to investigate the autophagic gene and protein 
expressions. The current study was approved by the Clinical Trial Ethical 
Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, following the 
ethical standards of scientific research (Registration no. 0303721).
RESULTS: Embryos that developed into blastocysts on day 5 (group D) had 
significantly higher relative expression of the LC3 gene (1.11 ± 0.52) and 
beclin-1 gene (1.43 ± 0.34) and beclin-1 protein expression (3.8 ± 0.028) than 
those that did not develop into blastocysts on day 5 (group A) [0.72 ± 0.18 
(P = 0.03), 0.35 ± 0.12 (P = 0.0001), and 3.14 ± 0.05, (P = 0.0001), 
respectively]. In contrast, mTOR and PIK3C3 protein expression was significantly 
higher in group A (arrested embryos) than those in group D (developed embryos) 
(P = 0.007 and P = 0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, the expression of the 
eIF4E gene was significantly lower in group D embryos (0.32 ± 0.07) than that in 
group A embryos (4.38 ± 1.16) (P = 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This work identifies  autophagy as a well regulated process 
required to maintain cell allocation and differentiation during late 
preimplantation embryo developmental stages."
252,"BACKGROUND: Aging is a biological process from which there is no escape. Diverse 
factors contribute to aging, most notably cell energy metabolism. Ribosome 
biogenesis and translation are the two main energy-consuming processes that 
contribute to longevity. It has repeatedly been shown that translation disorders 
caused by deletion of ribosomal genes delay aging. However, the effect of 
increasing the amount of ribosomal proteins has remained elusive.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We determine the relative level of the uL6A and uL6B mRNA 
derived from the genome and the plasmid. The appearance of additional copies of 
plasmid-derived uL6 leads to an increase in uL6A and uL6B derived from the 
BY4741 genome (mainly form B). The relative amount of mRNA of plasmid form B is 
several times greater than the amount of mRNA in plasmid form A. The level of 
mRNA derived from the plasmid is increased many times compared to the mRNA of 
genomic origin. Additionally, the study indicates that excess of uL6A is a 
limiting or even harmful factor in the reaction to stressful conditions. 
Therefore, our hypothesis states that uL6A transcription or mRNA uL6A 
degradation in yeast cells are tightly regulated. our data clearly demonstrate 
that aging is accelerated when additional copies of uL6 paralogs appear.
CONCLUSION: Overexpression of both uL6A or uL6B accelerates aging in the budding 
yeast. The level of uL6A mRNA is tightly controlled by yeast cell. The uL6a 
protein plays a pivotal role in the response to environmental stress, including 
oxidative and osmotic stress, and thus may fall into the class of moonlighting 
ribosomal proteins with extra-ribosomal function."
253,"BACKGROUND: Stevia rebaudiana is a medicinal herb that accumulates non-caloric 
sweeteners called steviol glycosides (SGs) which are approximately 300 times 
sweeter than sucrose. This study used alginate (ALG) as an elicitor to increase 
steviol glycosides accumulation and elucidate gene transcription in the steviol 
glycosides biosynthesis pathway.
METHODS AND RESULTS: To minimize the grassy taste associated with stevia 
sweeteners, plantlets were grown in complete darkness. ALG was applied to stevia 
plants grown in suspension culture with a Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium to 
determine its effect on SGs' content and the transcription profile of SG-related 
genes using the HPLC and RT-qPCR methods, respectively. Treatment with alginate 
did not significantly affect plantlet growth parameters such as shoot number, 
dry and fresh weight. Rebaudioside A (Reb A) content increased approximately 
sixfold in the presence of 1g L-1 alginate and KS, KAH, and UGT74G1 genes showed 
significant up-regulation. When the concentration was increased to 2g L-1, the 
transcription of KO and UGT76G1, responsible for the conversion of stevioside to 
Reb A, was increased about twofold.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study proposes that adding alginate to the MS 
suspension medium can increase Reb A levels by altering the SG biosynthesize 
pathway's transcription profile. The present experiment provides new insights 
into the biochemical and transcriptional response mechanisms of 
suspension-cultured stevia plants to alginate."
254,"Biofilms are communities of microbial cells surrounded by an extracellular 
polysaccharide matrix, recognized as a fungal source for local and systemic 
infections and less susceptible to antifungal drugs. Thus, treatment of 
biofilm-related Candida spp. infections with popular antifungals such as 
fluconazole is limited and species-dependent and alternatively demands the use 
of expensive and high toxic drugs. In this sense, molecules with antibiofilm 
activity have been studied but without care regarding the use of important 
criteria such as antibiofilm concentration lower than antifungal concentration 
when considering the process of inhibition of formation and concentrations equal 
to or lower than 300 µM. Therefore, this review tries to gather the most 
promising molecules regarding the activity against the C. albicans biofilm 
described in the last 10 years, considering the activity of inhibition and 
eradication. From January 2011 to July 2021, articles were searched on Scopus, 
PubMed, and Science Direct, combining the keywords ""antibiofilm,"" ""candida 
albicans,"" ""compound,"" and ""molecule"" with AND and OR operators. After 3 phases 
of selection, 21 articles describing 42 molecules were discussed in the review. 
Most of them were more promising for the inhibition of biofilm formation, with 
SM21 (24) being an interesting molecule for presenting inhibitory and 
eradication activity in biofilms with 24 and 48 h, as well as alizarin (26) and 
chrysazine (27), with concentrations well below the antifungal concentration. 
Despite the detection of these molecules and the attempts to determine the 
mechanisms of action by microscopic analysis and gene expression, no specific 
target has been determined. Thus, a gap is signaled, requiring further studies 
such as proteomic analyses to clarify it."
255,"Exosomes have come to the fore in drug delivery systems due to their 
biological-based and immune-suppressing properties. In this study, we 
investigated the effect of doxorubicin loading of exosomes isolated from human 
platelets on breast cancer.Exosomes released from ADP (1 µM)-activated platelets 
were isolated by the ultracentrifugation method, and their size and charge were 
measured with a TEM and zeta sizer. Then doxorubicin (Dox) loading into exosomes 
(PLT-Exo-Dox) was done by electroporation and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cells. 
In exosome characterization, CD62 positivity was higher in platelet pellets, 
while CD9 positivity was higher in released exosomes. The size of PLT-Exo and 
PLT-Exo-Dox was 82.02 ± 5.21 nm and 116 ± 3.73 nm, with a polydispersity index 
of 0.26 ± 0.04 and 0.39 ± 0.06, and the Zeta potential was - 16.45 mV and 
24.07 mV, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency of the preparation was 
86.02 ± 6.16%, with a drug loading capacity of 4.75 ± 0.16 µg/µg of the exosome. 
In MDA-MB-231 cells, PLT-Exo increased cell viability, while PLT-Exo-Dox 
decreased in 24 h. The Annexin-V binding level and Bax gene expression were 
increased in PLT-Exo-Dox and Bcl-2 gene expression was decreased. This study 
will shed light on the development of release systems that can be effective with 
chemotherapeutic agents by using exosomes released by cells in the development 
of personalized treatments."
256,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Acanthopanax 
senticosus, also known as Ciwujia or Siberian ginseng in Chinese, has a wide 
range of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The study aims to explore 
the action mechanism of A. senticosus against Alzheimer's disease using network 
pharmacology and molecular docking. The active ingredients and targets of A. 
senticosus were searched through the ETCM database, and Alzheimer's 
disease-related targets were obtained through the OMIM and GeneCards databases. 
The Cytoscape 3.7.2 software was used to construct a ""drug-component-target"" 
relationship network, and the target genes of A. senticosus against Alzheimer's 
disease were imported into the String database to establish a protein 
interaction (PPI) network. The Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes gene enrichment analyses were performed through the Metascape database 
to obtain potential pathways of action of A. senticosus for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease, and the ability of these active ingredients to bind to core 
targets was then verified by molecular docking. 51 active ingredients were 
screened from A. senticosus, and 88 effective targets for Alzheimer's disease 
were screened. Topological and pathway-enrichment analyses revealed that A. 
senticosus could play a beneficial role in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease 
by regulating apoptosis and inflammation. Molecular docking results showed that 
Ciwujianoside B, Chiisanoside, and Ciwujianoside D1 had strong binding abilities 
to key target proteins (TNFα, IL1β, and CASP3). Collectively, A. senticosus is 
feasible in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."
257,"Constructed wetland-microbial fuel cells are used to treat heavy metal and/or 
refractory organic wastewater. However, the electron transport mechanism of 
downflow Leersia hexandra constructed wetland-microbial fuel cells (DLCW-MFCs) 
is poorly understood when used to treat composite-polluted wastewater containing 
Cr(VI) and p-chlorophenol (4-CP) (C&P). In this study, metagenomics and in situ 
electrochemical techniques were used to investigate the electrochemical 
properties and the electricigens and their dominant gene functions. The DLCW-MFC 
was used to treat C&P and single-pollutant wastewater containing Cr(VI) (SC) and 
4-CP (SP). The results showed that C&P had a higher current response and charge 
transfer capability and lower solution resistance plus charge transfer 
resistance. The anode bacteria solution of C&P contained more electron carriers 
(RF, FMN, FAD, CoQ10, and Cyt c). Metagenomic sequencing indicated that the 
total relative abundance of the microorganisms associated with electricity 
production (Desulfovibrio, Pseudomonas, Azospirillum, Nocardia, Microbacterium, 
Delftia, Geobacter, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, and Clostridium) was the highest in 
C&P (4.24%). However, Microbacterium was abundant in SP (0.12%), which exerted 
antagonistic effects on other electricigens. Among the 10 electricigens based on 
gene annotation, C&P had a higher overall relative abundance of the Unigene gene 
annotated to the KO pathway and CAZy level B compared with SC and SP, which were 
1.31% and 0.582% respectively. Unigene153954 (ccmC), Unigene357497 (coxB), and 
Unigene1033667 (ubiG) were related to the electron carrier Cyt c, electron 
transfer, and CoQ biosynthesis, respectively. These were annotated to 
Desulfovibrio, Delftia, and Pseudomonas, respectively. Unigene161312 (AA1) used 
phenols and other substrates as electron donors and was annotated to 
Pseudomonas. Other functional carbohydrate enzyme genes (e.g., GT2, GT4, and 
GH31) used carbohydrates as donors and were annotated to other electricigens. 
This study provides a theoretical basis for electron transfer to promote the 
development of CW-MFCs."
258,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide; 
however, the potentially possible molecular biological mechanism of CRC is still 
not completely comprehended. This study aimed to confirm candidate key hub genes 
involved in the growth and development of CRC and their connection with immune 
infiltration as well as the related pathways. Gene expression data were selected 
from the GEO dataset. Hub genes for CRC were identified on the basis of 
differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
(WGCNA), and LASSO regression. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), 
Gene Ontology (GO), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were applied to 
reveal possible functions of the differential genes. Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) 
was implemented to identify the relationship between immune cells infiltration 
and hub genes. Two hundred and sixty-two differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
were identified. Three modules were acquired based on WGCNA, and the blue module 
presented the highest relevance with CRC. Ten hub genes (AQP8, B3GALT5, CDH3, 
CEMIP, CPM, FOXQ1, PLAC8, SCNN1B, SPINK5, and SST) were acquired with LASSO 
analysis as underlying biomarkers for CRC. Compared with normal tissues, CRC 
tissues presented significantly higher numbers of CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B 
cells, natural regulatory T (Treg) cells, and monocytes. The functional 
enrichment analyses demonstrated that hub genes were primarily enriched in 
metabolic process, inflammatory-related, and immune-related response. Ten hub 
genes were identified to be involved in the occurrence and development of CRC 
and may be deemed as novel biomarkers for clinical diagnosis and treatment."
259,"The spread of HIV is on the rise and has become a global issue, especially for 
underdeveloped and developing countries. This is due to the fact that HIV 
majorly occurs asymptomatically and is implausible for early diagnosis. Recent 
advances in research and science have enabled the investigation of a new 
potential treatment involving gene-based therapy, known as RNA interference 
(RNAi) that will direct gene silencing and further compensate for natural 
variants and viral mutants. Several types of small regulatory RNA are discussed 
in this present study, including microRNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA 
(siRNA), and short hairpin RNA (shRNA).This paper examines the mechanism of RNAi 
as a viable HIV therapy, using a minimum of four shRNAs to target both 
dispensable host components (CCR5) and viral genes (Gag, Env, Tat, Pol I, Pol II 
and Vif). Moreover, a multiplexed mechanism of shRNAs and miRNA is known to be 
effective in preventing viral escape due to mutation as the miRNA develops a 
general polycistronic platform for the expression of a large amount of 
shRNA-miRs. Several administration methods as well as the advantages of this 
RNAi treatment are also discussed in this study. The administration methods 
include (1) ex vivo delivery with the help of viral vectors, nanoparticles, and 
electroporation, (2) nonspecific in vivo delivery using non-viral carriers 
including liposomes, dendrimers and aptamers, as well as (3) targeted delivery 
that uses antibodies, modified nanoparticles, nucleic acid aptamers, and 
tissue-specific serotypes of AAV. Moreover, the advantages of this treatment are 
related to the effectiveness in silencing the HIV gene, which is more compatible 
compared to other gene therapy treatments, such as ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas9."
260,"Deleterious effects on anther development and main economy traits caused by 
sterile genes or cytoplasms are one of the important genetic characteristics of 
cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) systems in cotton, which severely hinder the 
large-scale application of ""three-line"" hybrids in production. Therefore, 
distinct characterization of each cytoplasmic type is mandatory to improve the 
breeding efficiency of cotton hybrids. In this study, four 
isonuclear-alloplasmic cotton male sterile lines with G. hirsutum (CMS-(AD)1), 
G. barbadense (CMS-(AD)2), G. harknessii (CMS-D2), and G. trilobum (CMS-D8) 
cytoplasms were first created by multiple backcrosses with common genotype 
Shikang126. Then, 64 pairs of mitochondrial simple sequence repeat (mtSSR) 
markers were designed to explore the mitochondrial DNA diversities among four 
isonuclear-alloplasmic cotton male sterile lines, and a total of nine pairs of 
polymorphic mtSSR molecular markers were successfully developed. Polymorphism 
analysis indicated that mtSSR59 marker correlated to the atp1 gene could 
effectively divide the CMS-D2, CMS-(AD)1, and CMS-(AD)2 in one category while 
the CMS-D8 in another category. Further cytological observation and 
determination of ATP contents also confirmed the accurate classification of 
CMS-D2 and CMS-D8 lines. Moreover, the mtSSR59 marker was successfully applied 
in the marker-assisted selection (MAS) for breeding new male sterile lines and 
precise differentiation or purity identification of different CMS-based 
""three-line"" and conventional cotton hybrids. This study provides new technical 
measures for classifying various cytoplasmic sterile lines, and our results will 
significantly improve the efficiency of there-line hybrid breeding in cotton."
261,"The thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) system plays a key role in the 
production of two-line hybrids in rapeseed (Brassica napus). To uncover key 
cellular events and genetic regulation associated with TGMS, a combined study 
using cytological methods and RNA-sequencing analysis was conducted for the 
rapeseed TGMS line 373S. Cytological studies showed that microspore cytoplasm of 
373S plants was condensed, the microspore nucleus was degraded at an early 
stage, the exine was irregular, and the tapetum developed abnormally, eventually 
leading to male sterility. RNA-sequencing analysis identified 430 differentially 
expressed genes (298 upregulated and 132 downregulated) between the fertile and 
sterile samples. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that the most highly 
represented biological processes included sporopollenin biosynthetic process, 
pollen exine formation, and extracellular matrix assembly. Kyoto encyclopedia of 
genes and genomes analysis indicated that the enriched pathways included amino 
acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Moreover, 26 
transcript factors were identified, which may be associated with abnormal 
tapetum degeneration and exine formation. Subsequently, 19 key genes were 
selected, which are considered to regulate pollen development and even 
participate in pollen exine formation. Our results will provide important 
insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying TGMS in rapeseed."
262,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small and noncoding RNA molecules (18-25 nt) 
that can regulate expression of their target genes post-transcriptionally. 
Previously, using high-throughput sequencing data obtained on a Solexa platform, 
we found that Bos taurus bta-miR-2904 (miR-2904) was significantly upregulated 
in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells infected with bovine viral diarrhea 
virus (BVDV) strain NADL at 2, 6, and 18 h postinfection (hpi) compared to 
uninfected MDBK cells. Moreover, miR-2904 overexpression significantly reduced 
BVDV replication. However, the mechanism by which miR-2904 inhibits viral 
replication remains unclear. In this study, we used electron microscopy, laser 
confocal microscopy, dual-luciferase reporter analysis, real-time PCR, and 
Western blot assays to investigate the effect of the miR-2904 expression on BVDV 
NADL replication and virus-infection-induced autophagy. The results indicate 
that miR-2904 inhibits autophagy of MDBK cells by targeting autophagy-related 
gene 13 (ATG13), and overexpression of miR-2904 inhibited the replication of 
BVDV NADL."
263,"AIMS: To investigate the main feature and the association between euglycemic 
diabetic ketoacidosis (euDKA) /diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and sodium-dependent 
glucose transporters 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) from the FDA adverse event reporting 
system (FAERS).
METHODS: Cases of SGLT-2i-associated with euDKA/DKA were extracted from the 
FAERS database and compared with the reports for other hypoglycemia agents 
(ATC10 class). Disproportionality analyses used the reporting odds ratio (ROR) 
and information components (IC). The lower limit of the IC 95% credibility 
interval for IC > 0 is considered a reported signal, with at least 3 cases.
RESULTS: A total of 10,195 cases of euDKA (n = 1680) and DKA (n = 8515) 
associated with SGLT-2i were identified from the FAERS. The SGLT-2i was 
associated with higher reporting of euDKA and DKA compared to other hypoglycemia 
agents (ROR = 16.69 [95% CI 14.89-18.70], IC = 3.27 [95% CI 2.91-3.66] for 
euDKA; ROR = 16.44 [95% CI 15.72-17.20], IC = 3.19 [95% CI 3.05-3.34] for DKA). 
In available data, the median onset time of euDKA/DKA was 31 days, and 
canagliflozin had the longest onset time (96.5 days for euDKA and 75 days for 
DKA) compared with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin (p < 0.05). Male patients 
predominate in euDKA (51.9%), and female patients predominate in DKA (53.7%). 
Most patients discontinue the treatment (95.5% for euDKA, 93.9% for DKA), and 
approximately 49.0% (n = 3658) of patients had symptomatic remission after 
discontinuation of SGLT-2i, and 2.3% (n = 173) of patients had no remission. 
About 75.6% (n = 6126) of patients need hospitalization after euDKA/DKA.
CONCLUSIONS: Post-marketing data showed that SGLT-2i was significantly 
associated with higher reporting of euDKA/DKA. Although euDKA/DKA is rare, 
clinicians should be aware of SGLT-2i-associated euDKA/DKA events."
264,"AIMS: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major healthcare challenge. We developed 
and internally and externally validated a risk prediction model of DN by 
integrating clinical factors and SNPs from genes of multiple CKD-related 
pathways in the Han Chinese population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1526 patients with type 2 diabetes were 
randomly allocated into derivation (n = 1019) or validation (n = 507) sets. 
External validation was performed with 3899 participants from the Taiwan 
Biobank. We selected 66 SNPs identified from literature review for building our 
weighted genetic risk score (wGRS). The steps for prediction model development 
integrating clinical and genetic information were based on the Framingham Heart 
Study.
RESULTS: The AUROC (95% CI) for this DN prediction model with combined clinical 
factors and wGRS was 0.81 (0.78, 0.84) in the derivation set. Furthermore, by 
directly using the information of these 66 SNPs, our final prediction model had 
AUROC values of 0.85 (0.82, 0.87), 0.89 (0.86, 0.91), and 0.77 (0.74, 0.80) in 
the derivation, internal validation, and external validation sets, respectively. 
Under the combined model, the results with a cutoff point of 30% showed 70.91% 
sensitivity, 67.84% specificity, 51.54% positive predictive value, and 82.86% 
negative predictive value.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and internally and externally validated a model with 
clinical factors and SNPs from genes of multiple CKD-related pathways to predict 
DN in Taiwan. This model can be used in clinical risk management practice as a 
screening tool to identify persons who are genetically predisposed to DN for 
early intervention and prevention."
265,"Novel function and mechanism of a PNP molecule VaEG45 from adzuki bean involved 
in plant immunity. Plant natriuretic peptides (PNPs) can affect a broad spectrum 
of physiological responses in plants acting as peptidic signaling molecules. 
However, PNPs may play additional roles in plant immunity. Our previous 
transcriptome data of adzuki bean (Vigna angularis) in response to Uromyces 
vignae infection revealed association of PNP-encoding gene VaEG45 with U. vignae 
resistance. To determine the function of VaEG45 in disease resistance, we cloned 
the 589 bp nucleotide sequence of VaEG45 containing 2 introns, encoding a 
putative 13.68 kDa protein that is 131 amino acids in length. We analyzed 
expression in different resistant cultivars of V. angularis and found 
significant induction of VaEG45 expression after U. vignae infection. Transient 
expression of VaEG45 improved tobacco resistance against Botrytis cinerea. We 
next analyzed the mechanism by which VaEG45 protects plants from fungal 
infection by determination of the biological activity of the prokaryotic 
expressed VaEG45. The results showed that the fusion protein VaEG45 can 
significantly inhibit urediospores germination of U. vignae, mycelial growth, 
and the infection of tobacco by B. cinerea. Further analysis revealed that 
VaEG45 exhibits β-1, 3-glucanase activity. These findings uncover the function 
of a novel PNP molecule VaEG45 and provide new evidence about the mechanism of 
PNPs in plant immunity."
266,"OsPPR11 belongs to the P-type PPR protein family and can interact with OsCAF2 to 
regulate Group II intron splicing and affect chloroplast development in rice. 
Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins participate in chloroplasts or 
mitochondria group II introns splicing in plants. The PPR protein family 
contains 491 members in rice, but most of their functions are unknown. In this 
study, we identified a nuclear gene encoding the P-type PPR protein OsPPR11 in 
chloroplasts. The qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that OsPPR11 was expressed in 
all plant tissues, but leaves had the highest expression. The osppr11 mutants 
had yellowing leaves and a lethal phenotype that inhibited chloroplast 
development and photosynthesis-related gene expression and reduced 
photosynthesis-related protein accumulation in seedlings. Moreover, 
photosynthetic complex accumulation decreased significantly in osppr11 mutants. 
The OsPPR11 is required for ndhA, and ycf3-1 introns splicing and interact with 
CRM family protein OsCAF2, suggesting that these two proteins may form splicing 
complexes to regulate group II introns splicing. Further analysis revealed that 
OsCAF2 interacts with OsPPR11 through the N-terminus. These results indicate 
that OsPPR11 is essential for chloroplast development and function by affecting 
group II intron splicing in rice."
267,"Environmental or occupational exposure of humans to trichloroethylene (TCE) has 
been associated with different extrahepatic toxic effects, including 
nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Bioactivation of TCE via the glutathione (GSH) 
conjugation pathway has been proposed as underlying mechanism, although only few 
mechanistic studies have used cell models of human origin. In this study, six 
human derived cell models were evaluated as in vitro models representing 
potential target tissues of TCE-conjugates: RPTEC/TERT1 (kidney), HepaRG 
(liver), HUVEC/TERT2 (vascular endothelial), LUHMES (neuronal, dopaminergic), 
human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) derived peripheral neurons (UKN5) 
and hiPSC-derived differentiated brain cortical cultures containing all subtypes 
of neurons and astrocytes (BCC42). A high throughput transcriptomic screening, 
utilizing mRNA templated oligo-sequencing (TempO-Seq), was used to study 
transcriptomic effects after exposure to TCE-conjugates. Cells were exposed to a 
wide range of concentrations of S-(1,2-trans-dichlorovinyl)glutathione 
(1,2-DCVG), S-(1,2-trans-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (1,2-DCVC), 
S-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)glutathione (2,2-DCVG), and 
S-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (2,2-DCVC). 1,2-DCVC caused stress responses 
belonging to the Nrf2 pathway and Unfolded protein response in all the tested 
models but to different extents. The renal model was the most sensitive model to 
both 1,2-DCVC and 1,2-DCVG, with an early Nrf2-response at 3 µM and hundreds of 
differentially expressed genes at higher concentrations. Exposure to 2,2-DCVG 
and 2,2-DCVC also resulted in the upregulation of Nrf2 pathway genes in 
RPTEC/TERT1 although at higher concentrations. Of the three neuronal models, 
both the LUHMES and BCC42 showed significant Nrf2-responses and at higher 
concentration UPR-responses, supporting recent hypotheses that 1,2-DCVC may be 
involved in neurotoxic effects of TCE. The cell models with the highest 
expression of γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) enzymes, showed cellular responses to 
both 1,2-DCVG and 1,2-DCVC. Little to no effects were found in the neuronal 
models from 1,2-DCVG exposure due to their low GGT-expression. This study 
expands our knowledge on tissue specificity of TCE S-conjugates and emphasizes 
the value of human cell models together with transcriptomics for such 
mechanistic studies."
268,"The two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study revealed a causal association 
of plasma proteins with osteoporosis (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA). Bone mineral 
density (BMD) is the gold standard for the clinical assessment of OP. Recent 
studies have shown that plasma proteins play an essential role in the regulation 
of bone development. However, the causal association of plasma proteins with BMD 
and OA remains unclear. We estimated the effects of 2889 plasma proteins on 2 
BMD phenotypes and 6 OA phenotypes using two-sample MR analysis based on the 
genome-wide association study summary statistics. Then, we performed sensitivity 
analysis and reverse-direction MR analysis to evaluate the robustness of the MR 
analysis results, followed by gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and KEGG 
pathway analysis to explore the functional relevance of the identified plasma 
proteins. Overall, we observed a total of 257 protein-estimated heel BMD 
associations, 17 protein-total-body BMD associations, 2 protein-all-OA 
associations, and 2 protein-knee-OA associations at PFDR < 0.05. 
Reverse-direction MR analysis demonstrated that there was little evidence of the 
causal association of BMD and OA with plasma proteins. GO enrichment analysis 
and KEGG pathway analysis identified multiple pathways, which may be involved in 
the development of OP and OA. Our findings recognized plasma proteins that could 
be used to regulate changes in OP and OA, thus, providing new insights into 
protein-mediated mechanisms of bone development."
269,"Together with an anti-tumor immune response, oncolysis using a recombinant viral 
vector promises to eliminate cancer cells by both gene transfer and 
host-mediated functions. In this study we explore oncolysis induced by 
nonreplicating adenoviral vectors used for p14ARF and interferon-β (hIFNβ) gene 
transfer in human melanoma cell lines, revealing an unexpected role for p14ARF 
in promoting cellular responses predictive of immune stimulation. Oncolysis was 
confirmed when UACC-62 (p53 wild-type) cells succumbed upon p14ARF gene transfer 
in vitro, whereas SK-Mel-29 (p53-mutant) benefitted from its combination with 
hIFNβ. In the case of UACC-62, in situ gene therapy in nude mice yielded reduced 
tumor progression in response to the p14ARF and hIFNβ combination. Potential for 
immune stimulation was revealed where p14ARF gene transfer in vitro was 
sufficient to induce emission of immunogenic cell death factors in UACC-62 and 
upregulate pro-immune genes, including IRF1, IRF7, IRF9, ISG15, TAP-1, and B2M. 
In SK-Mel-29, p14ARF gene transfer induced a subset of these factors. hIFNβ was, 
as expected, sufficient to induce these immune-stimulating genes in both cell 
lines. This work is a significant advancement for our melanoma gene therapy 
strategy because we revealed not only the induction of oncolysis, but also the 
potential contribution of p14ARF to immune stimulation."
270,"BACKGROUND: RERE is a highly conserved transcriptional co-regulator that is 
associated with a human neurodevelopmental disorder with or without anomalies of 
the brain, eye, or heart (NEDBEH, OMIM: 616975).
RESULTS: We show that the zebrafish rerea mutant (babyface) robustly 
recapitulates optic fissure closure defects resulting from loss of RERE 
function, as observed in humans. These defects result from expansion of proximal 
retinal optic stalk and reduced expression of some of the ventral retinal fate 
genes due to deregulated shh signaling. Using zebrafish and cell-based assays, 
we determined that NEDBEH-associated human RERE variants function as hypomorphs 
in their ability to repress shh signaling and some exhibit abnormal nuclear 
localization. Inhibiting shh signaling by the shh/gli inhibitor HPI-1 rescues 
coloboma, confirming our observation that coloboma in rerea mutants is indeed 
due to deregulation of shh signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: Zebrafish rerea mutants exhibit optic stalk and optic fissure 
closure defects. The optic fissure closure defect was rescued by an shh 
signaling inhibitor, suggesting that this defect could arise due to deregulated 
shh signaling. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
271,"OBJECTIVES: Phosphate and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) acts as a regulator of 
PI3-KAkt molecular pathway. ETS Related gene (ERG), an oncogene located in 
chromosome 21q22.2, is involved in prostate cancer (PCa) by serine 2 (TMPRSS2), 
a protein encoded by TMPRSS2 gene. The aim of this study is to evaluate the 
clinical impact of PTEN loss and ERG rearrangement in terms of oncologic results 
in patients diagnosed with localized PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective data were collected from a total of 74 
patients who underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy for localized PCa 
and immunohistochemical study was performed in tissue samples. The primary 
antibodies for anti-ERG antibody as well as anti-PTEN antibody were obtained 
from DAKO. ERG was considered positive if at least 20% of the evaluated cells 
were stained at least with medium intensity. PTEN protein loss was considered 
when the intensity of cytoplasmic and nuclear staining was mild or entirely 
negative across > 10% of tumor cells.
RESULTS: Homogenous loss of PTEN was associated with higher clinical 
International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade (p = 0.018) while no 
statistical significant association was present regarding the presence of ERG 
rearrangement with either ISUPc or ISUPp. After a median follow up of 34 months, 
24 patients developed biochemical recurrence. No statistical significant 
correlation of ERG status with biochemical recurrence was noted while PTEN was 
associated with biochemical recurrence development in a statistical significant 
way. Lastly the combination of PTEN loss with ERG rearrangement presence was 
detected more often in higher ISUPc and ISUPp as well as biochemical recurrence 
development, although in a non statistical significant way.
CONCLUSIONS: Homogenous and heterogenous PTEN loss was associated with 
biochemical recurrence. No association of ERG and biochemical recurrence was 
noted. The combination of PTEN loss and ERG rearrangement presented a trend for 
higher ISUPc and ISUPp as well as biochemical recurrence but not in a 
statistical significant way."
272,"BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy with a 2 per 100 000 
incidence rate in the world. Overall survival (OS) of patients in stage I-II 
disease is around 80%, whereas OS of patients in stage III-IVB disease drops to 
60%, implying the importance of diagnosis to reduce NPC mortality. However, more 
than 70% patients of NPC were diagnosed at advanced stages (stage III and IV) in 
clinics, and it definitely contributes to little substantial improvement in the 
5-year survival rates although NPC is sensitive to radio-and chemotherapy. 
Hence, development of novel biomarkers and targetable genes in NPC is eagerly 
awaited.
METHODS: We had analyzed the dataset GSE12452 and found hundreds of genes 
trans-activated in NPC. Among them, this study focused on PARP-1 binding protein 
(PARPBP) whose overexpression was also validated in GSE13597 and GSE53819 
datasets.
RESULTS: Knockdown of PARPBP significantly reduced cell viability in NPC and 
also identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes including 377 
downregulated and 518 upregulated genes in HONE-1 cells with stably knockdown 
PARPBP. Furthermore, PARPBP might promote cell migration and invasion in NPC 
through positive regulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2C (UBE2C).
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the aberrant expression of PARPBP in NPC, 
and imply its importance in nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis which further opens up 
the possibility of PARPBP as a novel diagnostic biomarker for NPC therapy."
273,"Skeletal muscle mass is closely related to strength and health. Multiple genes 
and signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle 
hypertrophy. miR-29 can participate in various processes of skeletal muscle 
development through different target genes. However, studies are needed on the 
function of miR-29 in skeletal muscle during mouse puberty. We used mice in 
which overexpression of miR-29ab1 cluster could be induced specifically within 
skeletal muscle, and investigated the effects of miR-29 overexpression on 
skeletal muscle at 1 month of age. We found that the overexpression of miR-29ab1 
cluster in juvenile mice caused skeletal muscle mass and myofiber 
cross-sectional area to increase. The study on the mechanism of miR-29 inducing 
skeletal muscle hypertrophy had found that miR-29 achieved its function by 
inhibiting the expression of Mstn. At the same time, injured myofibers were 
present within miR-29ab1 cluster overexpressing skeletal muscle. The damage of 
skeletal muscle may be due to the inhibition of the type IV collagen by miR-29. 
These results indicate that although the overexpression of miR-29ab1 cluster can 
induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy in mouse juvenile, it simultaneously causes 
skeletal muscle damage."
274,"Systematic identification of signaling pathways required for the fitness of 
cancer cells will facilitate the development of new cancer therapies. We used 
gene essentiality measurements in 1,086 cancer cell lines to identify selective 
co-essentiality modules and found that a ubiquitin ligase complex composed of 
UBA6, BIRC6, KCMF1 and UBR4, which is required for the survival of a subset of 
epithelial tumors that exhibit a high degree of aneuploidy. Suppressing BIRC6 in 
cell lines that are dependent on this complex led to a substantial reduction in 
cell fitness in vitro and potent tumor regression in vivo. Mechanistically, 
BIRC6 suppression resulted in selective activation of the integrated stress 
response (ISR) by stabilization of the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), a direct 
ubiquitination target of the UBA6/BIRC6/KCMF1/UBR4 complex. These observations 
uncover a novel ubiquitination cascade that regulates ISR and highlight the 
potential of ISR activation as a new therapeutic strategy."
275,"Colletotrichum fungi could cause anthracnose, a destructive disease in tea-oil 
trees. The sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) tebuconazole has been widely 
used in controlling plant diseases for many years. However, the baseline 
sensitivity of Colletotrichum isolates on tea-oil trees to tebuconazole has not 
been determined. In this study, the sensitivity of 117 Colletotrichum isolates 
from tea-oil tree of 7 provinces in southern China to tebuconazole was tested. 
The mean effective concentration resulted in 50% mycelial growth inhibition 
(EC50) was 0.7625 μg/mL. The EC50 of 100 isolates (83%) were lower than 1 μg/mL, 
20 isolates (17%) were higher than 1 μg/mL, which implied the resistance has 
already occurred in Colletotrichum isolates on tea-oil trees. The EC50 values of 
the most resistant and sensitive isolates (named Ca-R and Cc-S1 respectively) 
were 1.8848 and 0.1561 μg/mL respectively. The resistance mechanism was also 
investigated in this study. Gene replacement experiment indicated that CYP51A/B 
gene of resistant isolates Ca-R and Cf-R1 cannot confer Cc-S1 fully resistance 
to DMI fungicides, though three point mutants, Cc-S1CYP51A-T306A and 
Cc-S1CYP51A-R478K exhibited decreased sensitivity to DMI fungicides. This result 
suggested that resistance of Colletotrichum isolates was partly caused by 
mutations in CYP51A. Moreover, expression level of CYP51A/B was almost identical 
among Ca-R, Cf-R1, Cc-S1 and Cc-S1CYP51A point mutants, which indicated that the 
resistance was irrelevant to the expression level of CYP51A, and other 
non-target-based resistance mechanism may exist. Our results could help to guide 
the application of DMI fungicide and be useful for investigating the mechanism 
of resistance."
276,"The plant pathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is a major threat to 
agriculture and the environment worldwide. Recent devastating outbreaks in 
Europe highlight the potential of this pathogen to cause emergent diseases. Xf 
subsp. multiplex ESVL and IVIA5901 strains that belong to sequence type (ST) 6 
were isolated from almond orchards within the outbreak area in Alicante province 
(Spain). Both strains share more than 99% of the chromosomal sequences), but the 
ESVL strain harbours two plasmids (pXF64-Hb_ESVL and pUCLA-ESVL). Here, 
virulence phenotypes and genome content were compared between both strains, 
using three strains from USA as a reference for the phenotypic analyses. 
Experiments in microfluidic chambers, used as simulation of xylem vessels, 
showed that twitching motility was absent in the IVIA5901 strain, while the ESVL 
strain had reduced twitching motility. Both Spanish strains had less biofilm 
formation, cell aggregation and lower virulence in tobacco compared with USA 
reference strains. Genome analysis of the two plasmids from ESVL revealed 51 
unique coding sequences (CDS) that were absent in the chromosome of IVIA5901. 
Comparison of the chromosomes of both strains showed some unique CDS and SNPs in 
each strain with potential deleterious mutations. Genomic differences found in 
genes previously associated with adhesion and motility might explain the 
differences in the phenotypic traits studied. Although additional studies are 
necessary to infer the potential role of Xf plasmids, our results indicate that 
the presence of plasmids should be considered in the study of the mechanisms of 
pathogenicity and adaptation in Xf to new environments."
277,"BACKGROUND: It is known that the microenvironmental cytokine IFN-γ provides a 
survival advantage for CLL cells. However, the mechanisms involved in this 
effect have not been properly investigated.
METHODS: Herein, we conducted a comprehensive screening of the effects of IFN-γ 
on signaling pathways and gene expression profile in CLL cells by using western 
blotting, RT-qPCR and high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).
RESULTS: We found that IFN-γ not only activated the pro-survival STAT3, but also 
activated the AKT and ERK signaling pathways. RNA-seq analysis showed that IFN-γ 
stimulation changed the expression profiles of more than 500 genes, with 391 
being up-regulated and 123 down-regulated. These genes are involved in numerous 
biological processes, including anti-apoptosis, cell migration and 
proliferation. IFN-γ significantly up-regulated the expression of CD38, BCL6, 
CXCL9, BCL2A1, SCOS3, IL-10, HGF, EGFR, THBS-1, FN1 and MUC1, which encode 
proteins potentially associated with disease progression, worse prognosis or 
poor response to treatment. Blocking JAK1/2 or STAT3 signal by specific 
inhibitors affected the expression of most genes, suggesting a pivotal role of 
the JAK1/2-STAT3 pathway in IFN-γ pro-survival effects in CLL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrates that IFN-γ regulates a complex pro-survival 
signal network in CLL through JAK1/2-STAT3, which provides a rational 
explanation for IFN-γ promoting CLL cells survival and drug resistance. This

278,"In June 2021, bacterial stem rot-like symptoms were observed on the stems and 
leaves of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus cv. 'Zaojia') in Pingyu County, 
Zhumadian City, Henan Province, China (32.44N 114.24E), which showed brown to 
dark brown lesions on the stems (Fig. 1A). The stems then became scorched, and 
the leaves showed necrotic lesions with small water-soaked spots (Fig. 1B). 
Watermelon is a very important economic plant in this small county, where the 
watermelon planting area accounts for about 15% of the arable land area. 
Approximately 2 hectares of 'Zaojia' have been investigated, and the disease 
incidence rates were almost 20~30%, thus, causing severe economic losses. Ten 
symptomatic watermelon stems and leaves were randomly collected based on the 
typical symptoms, brought into the Lab and used to isolate the pathogen. Each 
infected tissue was excised and cut into small pieces (about 5 mm×5 mm) and 
surface disinfected with 1% NaClO for 3 min. The pieces were then rinsed three 
times in sterile distilled water (SDW) and dried by airing. These pieces (4-5 
pieces per sample) were macerated in 200 μL SDW for 60 s in a sterile mortar and 
pestle. A volume of 5 μL suspensions of each sample were streaked onto two LB 
agar plates and incubated for 48 h at 28 °C in the dark. After incubation, the 
colonies on LB agar plate were small, round, raised, white to cream-colored, and 
had smooth margins (Fig. 2). Two strains from each plate were selected. The 
genomic DNA of all 40 strains was extracted using a Bacterial Genomic DNA 
Extraction Kit D1600 (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, 
China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene 
(27F:5'-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3', /1492R: 5'-CTA CGG CTA CCT TGT TAC 
GA-3'), and the three housekeeping genes, including gyrB (Trantas et al., 2013), 
icdA and proA (Ma et al., 2007), were amplified. Sequence analysis showed that 
40 strains shared the same sequence, so only one sequence was submitted into 
GenBanK.The 16s rDNA partial sequences (SUB12134746) shared 100% similarity with 
E.mori (CP084692.1), and the gyrB (OP676246), icdA (OP676248) and proA 
(OP676247) genes shared 98.67%, 99.39% and 97.99% homology with those of E. mori 
(CP084692.1), respectively. Besides, the phylogenetic tree analysis based on 
multi-housekeeping gene joint gryB-icdA-proA showed that 
E.mori（OP676246-OP676248- OP676247）from watermelon was culsterd with the E.mori 
(CP084692.1) from South Korea and E.mori (CP055276.1) from kiwifruit (Fig. 3). 
Thus, E.mori was confirmed to be the pathogen responsible for bacterial soft rot 
of watermelon in this study. To confirm the pathogenicity, 15-day-old healthy 
cv. 'Zaojia' watermelon seedlings were inoculated by spraying all the seedlings 
with a bacterial suspension (1×10 8 CFU mL-1) at an incubation temperature of 28 
°C and 70% relative humidity, and sterile distilled liquid LB medium was applied 
as a negative control treatment. Three times were conducted for the isolate, and 
each time included nine watermelon plants. After 10 days, only the inoculated 
cotyledons and leaves with the bacterial suspension showed bacterial leaf spots 
that resembled those observed on naturally infected watermelon cotyledons and 
leaves (Fig. 4A-C), whereas the control plants remained asymptomatic (Fig. 4D). 
Simultaneously, the watermelon stems were inoculated with the bacterium in 
vitro. Each stem was slightly wounded with a metal sponge and then sprayed with 
the bacterial suspension (108 CFU mL-1) of each isolate, and the experiment was 
repeated three times. Water-soaked symptoms were visible on the stems (Fig. 4E), 
while the control plants remained asymptomatic (Fig. 4F). The strains were then 
successfully re-isolated and identified by sequence analyses of their 16S 
ribosomal RNA gene and gyrB, icdA and proA genes. Therefore, the inoculation 
experiment of the isolatedbacterium fulfilled Koch's postulates. Previously, E. 
mori has been reported to cause bacterial wilt on white mulberry (Morus alba L.) 
(Zhu et al. 2022), peach fruit (Prunus persica) (Ahmad et al. 2021) and 
kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa [A. Chev.] CF Liang et AR Ferguson) (Zhang et al. 
2021). To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. mori causing bacterial 
soft rot on watermelon in world."
279,"Increasing female age is accompanied by a corresponding fall in her fertility. 
This decline is influenced by a variety of factors over an individual's life 
course including background genetics, local environment and diet. Studying both 
coding and non-coding RNAs of the embryo could aid our understanding of the 
causes and/or effects of the physiological processes accompanying the decline 
including the differential expression of sub-cellular biomarkers indicative of 
various diseases. The current study is a post-hoc analysis of the expression of 
trophectoderm RNA data derived from a previous high throughput study. Its main 
aim is to determine the characteristics and potential functionalities that 
characterize long non-coding RNAs. As reported previously, a maternal 
age-related component is potentially implicated in implantation success. 
Trophectoderm samples representing the full range of maternal reproductive ages 
were considered in relation to embryonic implantation potential, trophectoderm 
transcriptome dynamics and reproductive maternal age. The long non-coding RNA 
(lncRNA) biomarkers identified here are consistent with the activities of 
embryo-endometrial crosstalk, developmental competency and implantation and 
share common characteristics with markers of neoplasia/cancer invasion. 
Corresponding genes for expressed lncRNAs were more active in the blastocysts of 
younger women are associated with metabolic pathways including cholesterol 
biosynthesis and steroidogenesis."
280,"BACKGROUND: DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit 3 (RPB3) is the third largest 
subunit of RNA polymerase II and is encoded by the POLR2C (OMIM:180663). A large 
Iranian family with congenital hearing loss and infertility is described here 
with genetic and clinical characterizations of five male patients.
METHODS: After doing clinical examinations, the proband was subjected to 
karyotyping and GJB2/6 sequencing to rule out the most evident chromosomal and 
gene abnormalities for male infertility and hearing loss, respectively. A 
custom-designed next-generation sequencing panel was also used to detect 
mutations in deafness-related genes. Finally, to reveal the underlying molecular 
cause(s) justifying hearing loss and male infertility, 5 male patients and 2 
healthy male controls within the family were subjected to paired-end whole-exome 
sequencing (WES). Linkage analysis was also performed based on the data.
RESULTS: All male patients showed prelingual sensorineural hearing loss and also 
decreased sperm motility. Linkage analysis determined 16q21 as the most 
susceptible locus in which a missense variant in exon 7 of 
POLR2C-NM_032940.3:c.545T>C;p.(Val182Ala)-was identified as a ""likely 
pathogenic"" variant co-segregated with phenotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Using segregation and in silico analyses, for the first time, we 
suggested that the NM_032940.3:c.545T>C; p.(Val182Ala) in POLR2C is associated 
with hearing loss and male infertility."
281,"INTRODUCTION: Diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) and diffuse hemispheric glioma (DHG) 
are both rare tumors characterized and recognized for specific alterations of 
histone 3 including H3K27 (DMG) and H3G34 (DHG). Despite these tumors arising 
from alterations of the same gene their clinical, radiological, and molecular 
behaviors strongly diverge, requiring a personalized therapeutic approach.
AREAS COVERED: We performed a review on Medline/PudMed aiming to search papers 
relative to prospective trials, retrospective studies, case series, and case 
reports of interest in order to investigate current knowledge toward the main 
clinical and molecular characteristics, radiology, and diagnosis, loco-regional 
and systemic treatments of these tumors. Moreover, we also evaluated the novel 
treatments under investigation.
EXPERT OPINION: Thanks to an increased knowledge of the genomic landscape of 
these rare tumors, there are novels promising therapeutic targets for these 
malignancies. However, the majority of available trials allowed enrollment only 
in DMG, while few studies are focused on or allow the inclusion of DHG patients."
282,"PURPOSE/AIM OF THE STUDY: Osteogenesis imperfecta is a heritable bone disorder 
that is usually caused by mutations in collagen type I encoding genes. The 
impact of such mutations on tendons, a structure with high collagen type I 
content, remains largely unexplored. We hypothesized that tendon properties are 
abnormal in the context of a mutation affecting collagen type I. The main 
purpose of the study was to assess the anatomical, mechanical, and material 
tendon properties of Col1a1Jrt/+ mice, a model of severe dominant OI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Flexor Digitorum Longus (FDL) tendon of Col1a1Jrt/+ 
mice and wild-type littermates (WT) was assessed with in vitro mechanical 
testing.
RESULTS: The results showed that width and thickness of FDL tendons were about 
40% larger in WT (p < 0.01) than in Col1a1Jrt/+ mice, whereas the 
cross-sectional area was 138% larger (p < 0.001). The stiffness, peak- and 
yield-force were between 160% and 194% higher in WT vs. Col1a1Jrt/+ mice. The 
material properties did not show significant differences between mouse strains 
with differences <15% between WT and Col1a1Jrt/+ (p > 0.05). Analysis of the 
Achilles tendon collagen showed no difference between mice strains for the 
content but collagen solubility in acetic acid was 66% higher in WT than in 
Col1a1Jrt/+ (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the FDL tendon of Col1a1Jrt/+ mice has 
reduced mechanical properties but apparently normal material properties. It 
remains unclear whether the tendon phenotype of Col1a1Jrt/+ mice is secondary to 
muscle weakness or a direct effect of the Col1a1 mutation or a combination of 
both."
283,"CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) enables programmable, reversible, and titratable 
repression of gene expression (knockdown) in mammalian cells. Initial 
CRISPRi-mediated genetic screens have showcased the potential to address basic 
questions in cell biology, genetics, and biotechnology, but wider deployment of 
CRISPRi screening has been constrained by the large size of single guide RNA 
(sgRNA) libraries and challenges in generating cell models with consistent 
CRISPRi-mediated knockdown. Here, we present next-generation CRISPRi sgRNA 
libraries and effector expression constructs that enable strong and consistent 
knockdown across mammalian cell models. First, we combine empirical sgRNA 
selection with a dual-sgRNA library design to generate an ultra-compact (1-3 
elements per gene), highly active CRISPRi sgRNA library. Next, we compare 
CRISPRi effectors to show that the recently published Zim3-dCas9 provides an 
excellent balance between strong on-target knockdown and minimal nonspecific 
effects on cell growth or the transcriptome. Finally, we engineer a suite of 
cell lines with stable expression of Zim3-dCas9 and robust on-target knockdown. 
Our results and publicly available reagents establish best practices for CRISPRi 
genetic screening."
284,"Cancer evolution is explained by accumulation of driver mutations and subsequent 
positive selection by acquired growth advantages like Darwin evolution. However, 
it has not yet been fully investigated whether negative selection of cells that 
have lost malignant properties contributes to cancer progression. Using 
intestinal metastatic tumor-derived organoids carrying Apc, Kras, Tgfbr2, and 
Trp53 quadruple mutations, we show here that approximately 30% of subclones of 
the organoids show loss of metastatic ability to the liver, while keeping the 
driver mutations and oncogenic pathways. Notably, highly metastatic subclones 
also showed gradual loss of metastatic ability during further passages. Such 
non-metastatic subclones showed significantly decreased survival and 
proliferation ability in Matrigel and collagen gel culture conditions, which may 
cause elimination from the tumor tissues in vivo. RNA sequencing indicated that 
stemness-related genes including Lgr5 and Myb were significantly downregulated 
in non-metastatic subclones as well as subclones that lost metastatic ability 
during additional passages. Furthermore, a CGH analysis showed that 
non-metastatic subclones were derived from minor population of parental organoid 
cells. These results indicate that metastatic ability is continuously lost with 
decreased stem cell property in certain subpopulations of malignant tumors, and 
such subpopulations are eliminated by negative selection. Therefore, it is 
possible that cancer evolution is regulated not only by positive selection but 
by negative selection. The mechanism underlying the loss of metastatic ability 
will be an important for future development of therapeutic strategies against 
metastasis."
285,"The association between cholesterol metabolism and cancer development and 
progression has been recently highlighted. However, the role and function of 
many cholesterol transporters remain largely unknown. Herein, we focused on 
ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 9 (ABCA9) transporter given that its 
expression is significantly downregulated in both canine mammary tumors and 
human breast cancers, which in breast cancer patients correlates with poor 
prognosis. We found that ABCA9 is mainly present in the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) and is responsible for promoting cholesterol accumulation in this 
structure. Accordingly, ABCA9 inhibited sterol-regulatory element binding 
protein-2 (SREBP-2) translocation from the ER to the nucleus, a crucial step for 
cholesterol synthesis, resulting in the downregulation of cholesterol synthesis 
gene expression. ABCA9 expression in breast cancer cells attenuated cell 
proliferation and reduced their colony-forming abilities. We identified ABCA9 
expression to be regulated by Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). Inhibition of PI3K 
induced enhanced ABCA9 expression through the activation of PI3K-Akt-FOXO1 
pathway in breast cancer cells. Altogether, our study suggests that ABCA9 
functions as an ER cholesterol transporter that suppresses cholesterol synthesis 
via the inhibition of SREBP-2 signaling and that its restoration halts breast 
cancer cell proliferation. Our findings provide novel insight into a vital role 
of ABCA9 in breast cancer progression."
286,"Resistance to anti-cancer therapy is a major challenge for cancer treatment. 
Many studies revealed that macroautophagy/autophagy inhibition can overcome 
autophagy-mediated therapy resistance, but these efforts have not yet led to the 
success of clinical applications. In a recent paper, we established a 37-gene 
autophagy signature to estimate the autophagy status of approximately 10,000 
tumor samples across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas, and 
muti-omics characterization reveals that autophagy induction may also sensitize 
cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs. These findings provide a comprehensive 
resource of molecular alterations associated with autophagy and highlight the 
potential to utilize drug sensitivity induced by autophagy to overcome the 
resistance of cancer therapy."
287,"Data on spatiotemporal distribution of rotavirus diarrhea are limited in many 
endemic settings. This study determined the prevalence and seasonal distribution 
of rotavirus among Nigerian children with diarrhea. Here, a total of 406 fecal 
samples were collected from patients attending six health facilities in Lagos 
between January - December 2019. Socio-demographic data of each enrolled child 
were collected. Rotavirus VP6 antigen was detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay 
(ELISA) and confirmation by VP7 gene detection by reverse transcription 
polymerase-chain reaction. The overall rotavirus diarrhea prevalence was 16.3% 
by ELISA with children above 2 years having 29.2% of this prevalence and higher 
occurrence in females (59.1%) than males (40.9%) (P < .05). Rotavirus diarrhea 
diagnosis using RT-PCR showed 100% concordance with ELISA. Cases of rotavirus 
diarrhea were detected from March to July and from September to November with 
the highest number of cases detected in May and June (22.7% each), followed by 
July (21.2%). The prevalence of rotavirus diarrhea remains high in Lagos with an 
emerging higher disease activity in children above 2. A different rotavirus 
transmission dynamics compared to previous studies from Nigeria and other 
African countries was found. VP6 ELISA may reliably be used for continuous 
rotavirus surveillance in Nigeria."
288,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effect of neonatal treatment with 
kaempferol on neuromotor development, proliferation of neural precursor cells, 
the microglia profile, and antioxidant enzyme gene expression in the 
hippocampus.
METHODS: A rat model of cerebral palsy was established using perinatal anoxia 
and sensorimotor restriction of hindlimbs during infancy. Kaempferol (1 mg/ kg) 
was intraperitoneally administered during the neonatal period.
RESULTS: Neonatal treatment with kaempferol reduces the impact of the cerebral 
palsy model on reflex ontogeny and on the maturation of physical features. 
Impairment of locomotor activity development and motor coordination was found to 
be attenuated by kaempferol treatment during the neonatal period in rats exposed 
to cerebral palsy. Neonatal treatment of kaempferol in cerebral palsy rats 
prevents a substantial reduction in the number of neural precursor cells in the 
dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, an activated microglia profile, and increased 
proliferation of microglia in the sub-granular zone and in the granular cell 
layer. Neonatal treatment with kaempferol increases gene expression of 
superoxide dismutase and catalase in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the 
cerebral palsy model.
DISCUSSION: Kaempferol attenuates the impact of cerebral palsy on neuromotor 
behavior development, preventing altered hippocampal microglia activation and 
mitigating impaired cell proliferation in a neurogenic niche in these rats. 
Neonatal treatment with kaempferol also increases antioxidant defense gene 
expression in the hippocampus of rats submitted to the cerebral palsy model."
289,"L. monocytogenes is a widely used infection model for the research on 
pathogenesis and host defense against gram-positive intracellular bacteria. 
Emerging evidence indicates that posttranslational modifications play a critical 
role in the regulation of macroautophagy/autophagy. However, little is known 
about the posttranslational modifications of ATG7, the essential protein in the 
autophagy process. In this study, we demonstrated that the RING-type E3 ligase 
TRIM7/RNF90 positively regulated autophagosome accumulation by promoting the 
ubiquitination of ATG7 at K413, thereby affecting L. monocytogenes infection. 
TRIM7 expression was induced by a variety range of conditions, including 
starvation, rapamycin stimulation, and L. monocytogenes infection. TRIM7 
deficiency in mice or cells resulted in elevated innate immune responses and 
increased L. monocytogenes infection. ATG7 was associated with TRIM7 and the 
positive regulatory role of TRIM7 in L. monocytogenes infection-, starvation- or 
rapamycin-induced autophagosome accumulation was suggested by TRIM7 deficiency, 
TRIM7 overexpression, and TRIM7 knockdown. Further mechanistic investigation 
indicated that TRIM7 promoted the K63-linked ubiquitination of ATG7 at K413 and 
ubiquitination at this site was required for the function of ATG7 in autophagy 
and L. monocytogenes infection. Thus, our findings suggested a new regulator in 
intracellular bacterial infection and autophagy, with a novel posttranslational 
modification targeting ATG7. This research may expand our understanding of host 
anti-bacterial defense and the role of autophagy in intracellular bacterial 
infection."
290,"Cell size control is one of the prerequisites for plant growth and development. 
Recently, a GRAS family transcription factor, SCARECROW-LIKE28 (SCL28), was 
identified as a critical regulator for both mitotic and postmitotic cell-size 
control. Here, we show that SCL28 is specifically expressed in proliferating 
cells and exerts its function to delay G2 progression during mitotic cell cycle 
in Arabidopsis thaliana. Overexpression of SCL28 provokes a significant 
enlargement of cells in various organs and tissues, such as leaves, flowers and 
seeds, to different extents depending on the type of cells. The increased cell 
size is most likely due to a delayed G2 progression and accelerated onset of 
endoreplication, an atypical cell cycle repeating DNA replication without 
cytokinesis or mitosis. Unlike DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING, a rice ortholog of 
SCL28, SCL28 may not have a role in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling because 
sensitivity against brassinazole, a BR biosynthesis inhibitor, was not 
dramatically altered in scl28 mutant and SCL28-overexpressing plants. 
Collectively, our findings strengthen a recently proposed model of cell size 
control by SCL28 and suggest the presence of diversified evolutionary mechanisms 
for the regulation and action of SCL28."
291,"AFF3 at 2q11.2 encodes the nuclear transcriptional activator AF4/FMR2 Family 
Member 3. AFF3 constitutes super elongation complex like 3, which plays a role 
in promoting the expression of genes involved in neurogenesis and development. 
The degron motif in AFF3 with nine highly conserved amino acids is recognized by 
E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce protein degradation. Recently, AFF3 missense 
variants in this region and variants featuring deletion including this region 
were identified and shown to cause KINSSHIP syndrome. In this study, we 
identified two novel and one previously reported missense variants in the degron 
of AFF3 in three unrelated Japanese patients. Notably, two of these three 
variants exhibited mosaicism in the examined tissues. This study suggests that 
mosaic variants also cause KINSSHIP syndrome, showing various phenotypes. This

292,"Circular RNAs (CircRNA) are a special type of non-coding RNA molecule with a 
closed ring structure and are not affected by RNA exonucases. It has stable 
expression, is not easy to degrade, and exists in most eukaryotes. However, 
circRNA regulation of cow mastitis has not been widely recognized. Mammary 
epithelial tissues were collected from healthy Holstein cows (HCN) and mastitis 
Holstein cows (HCU). RNA sequencing (RNA SEQ) was performed for the 
differentially expressed circRNAs, and analysis results showed that 19 
differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in HCN and HCU, among which 6 
circRNAs were up-regulated and 13 circRNAs were down-regulated. We randomly 
selected nine circRNAs for Q-PCR verification, and the results showed consistent 
expression. Three circRNAs: circRNA2860, circRNA5323 and circRNA4027 were 
confirmed to be significantly differentially expressed circRNAs in cow mastitis. 
Also, their host genes TRPS1, SLC12A2 and MYH11 might be directly or indirectly 
play a role in cow mastitis. Furthermore, RNA polymerase transcription factor 
binding and tight junction are most enriched in GO and KEGG pathways, 
respectively. In addition, the regulatory network of circRNA-miRNA has been 
inferred from a bioinformatics perspective, which may help to understand the 
underlying molecular mechanism of circRNAs involved in regulating mastitis in 
cows."
293,"BACKGROUND: Renal tubular injury is the main feature of diabetic nephropathy 
(DN). We intend to investigate the function and related mechanisms of lncRNA 
SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2OT) in high glucose (HG)-induced oxidative 
stress and apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs).
METHODS: To construct diabetes models, the human kidney-2 (HK-2) cells were 
treated with HG (30 mM), and mice were injected with streptozotocin. The levels 
of intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed 
by dihydroethidium staining and MitoSox staining. The cell apoptosis was 
assessed by flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. Levels of serum creatinine, blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), Urinary ACR, and oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2' 
-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were detected by relevant kits. In addition, 
fluorescence in situ hybridization staining, RNA-pull down, RNA 
immunoprecipitation (RIP), co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), dual-luciferase 
reporter gene assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) were also 
executed.
RESULTS: Levels of SOX2OT and silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) were 
down-regulated in HG-cultured HK-2 cells. Overexpressing SOX2OT reduced 
intracellular and mitochondrial ROS levels and cell apoptosis in vitro. 
Moreover, SOX2OT overexpression also reduced serum creatinine, BUN, urinary ACR, 
8-OHdG, renal tubular injury markers KIM1 and NGAL, ROS levels, and cell 
apoptosis in vivo. In addition, SOX2OT promoted SIRT1 expression by suppressing 
its ubiquitination. Besides, interference with SIRT1 reversed the inhibitory 
effect of SOX2OT overexpression on HG-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. 
Forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) levels were up-regulated in HG-cultured HK-2 cells. 
Foxa2 could bind to the SOX2OT promoter and suppress its expression. 
Furthermore, interfering with SOX2OT reversed the inhibitory effect of Foxa2 
interference on HG-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Foxa2-mediated SOX2OT up-regulation reduced oxidative stress and 
apoptosis of RTECs by promoting SIRT1 expression, thus alleviating the 
progression of DN. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
294,"The tiger, a poster child for conservation, remains an endangered apex predator. 
Continued survival and recovery will require a comprehensive understanding of 
genetic diversity and the use of such information for population management. A 
high-quality tiger genome assembly will be an important tool for conservation 
genetics, especially for the Indian tiger, the most abundant subspecies in the 
wild. Here, we present high-quality near-chromosomal genome assemblies of a 
female and a male wild Indian tiger (Panthera tigris tigris). Our assemblies had 
a scaffold N50 of >140 Mb, with 19  scaffolds corresponding to the 19 numbered 
chromosomes, containing 95% of the genome. Our assemblies also enabled detection 
of longer stretches of runs of homozygosity compared to previous assemblies, 
which will help improve estimates of genomic inbreeding. Comprehensive genome 
annotation identified 26,068 protein-coding genes, including several gene 
families involved in key morphological features such as the teeth, claws, 
vision, olfaction, taste, and body stripes. We also identified 301 microRNAs, 
365 small nucleolar RNAs, 632 transfer RNAs, and other noncoding RNA elements, 
several of which are predicted to regulate key biological pathways that likely 
contribute to the tiger's apex predatory traits. We identify signatures of 
positive selection in the tiger genome that are consistent with the Panthera 
lineage. Our high-quality genome will enable use of noninvasive samples for 
comprehensive assessment of genetic diversity, thus supporting effective 
conservation and management of wild tiger populations."
295,"Protein translation is an essential cellular process and dysfunctional protein 
translation causes various neurodevelopmental disorders. The eukaryotic 
translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the 
ribosome, while the eEF1B complex acts as a guanine exchange factor (GEF) of GTP 
for GDP indirectly catalyzing the release of eEF1A from the ribosome. The gene 
EEF1D encodes the eEF1Bδ subunit of the eEF1B complex. EEF1D is alternatively 
spliced giving rise to one long and three short isoforms. Two different 
homozygous, truncating variants in EEF1D had been associated with severe 
intellectual disability and microcephaly in two families. The published variants 
only affect the long isoform of EEF1D that acts as a transcription factor of 
heat shock element proteins. By exome sequencing, we identified two different 
homozygous variants in EEF1D in two families with severe developmental delay, 
severe microcephaly, spasticity, and failure to thrive with optic atrophy, poor 
feeding, and recurrent aspiration pneumonias. The EEF1D variants of this study 
are localized in the C-terminal GEF domain suggesting that a disturbed protein 
translation machinery might contribute to the neurodevelopmental phenotype. 
Pathogenic variants localized in both the alternatively spliced domain or in the 
GEF domain of EEF1D cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly 
and spasticity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
296,"Cancer immunotherapy agents fight cancer via immune system stimulation and have 
made significant advances in minimizing side effects and prolonging the survival 
of patients with solid tumors. However, major limitations still exist in cancer 
immunotherapy, including the inefficiency of immune response stimulation in 
specific cancer types, therapy resistance caused by the tumor microenvironment 
(TME), toxicities by the immune imbalance, and short lifetime of stimulator of 
interferon genes (STING) agonist. Recent advances in nanomedicine have shown 
significant potential in overcoming the obstacles of cancer immunotherapy. 
Several nanoscale agents have been reported for cancer immunotherapy, including

297,"OBJECTIVE: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although it is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous 
disease, it is usually treated with R-CHOP chemotherapy. Here, we aimed to 
investigate gene expression frequency with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and 
the relation of gene mutations with remission and relapse status in patients 
with DLBCLs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated gene mutation profiles by NGS in patients 
with DLBCL-NOS and analyzed the correlation between gene mutations and response 
and relapse rates and other clinical indices.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight of forty patients were evaluated. The most commonly 
mutated genes were ANKRD, BRCA1, BRCA2, EZH2, KMTC2, MYC, MYD88, NF1, NOTCH1, 
PMS2, PTEN, and WRN. The relapse rate was found higher in DLBCL patients with 
ANKRD26, BRCA2, MYD88, and NOTCH1 mutations. Also, remission duration was found 
shorter in patients with ANKRD26, BRCA2, and MYD88 mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the presence of some genetic mutations 
is effective on prognosis in patients with DLBCL. NGS-based evaluation of DLBCL 
treatment can be used in the future."
298,"The collateral impact of antibiotics on the microbiome has attained increasing 
attention. However, the ecological consequences of long-term antibiotic exposure 
on the gut microbiome, including antibiotic resistance, are still limited. Here, 
we investigated long-term exposure effects to amoxicillin on the human gut 
microbiome and resistome. Fecal samples were collected from 20 patients 
receiving 3-months of amoxicillin or placebo treatment as part of a Norwegian 
multicenter clinical trial on chronic low back pain (AIM study). Samples were 
collected at baseline, last day of treatment, and 9 months after antibiotic 
cessation. The abundance and diversity of microbial and resistome composition 
were characterized using whole shotgun and functional metagenomic sequencing 
data. While the microbiome profiles of placebo subjects were stable over time, 
discernible changes in diversity and overall microbiome composition were 
observed after amoxicillin treatment. In particular, health-associated 
short-chain fatty acid producing species significantly decreased in proportion. 
However, these changes were short-lived as the microbiome showed overall 
recovery 9 months post-treatment. On the other hand, exposure to long-term 
amoxicillin was associated with an increase in total antimicrobial resistance 
gene load and diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes, with persistent 
changes even at 9 months post-treatment. Additionally, beta-lactam resistance 
was the most affected antibiotic class, suggesting a targeted response to 
amoxicillin, although changes at the gene level varied across individuals. 
Overall, our results suggest that the impact of prolonged amoxicillin exposure 
was more explicit and long-lasting in the fecal resistome than in microbiome 
composition. Such information is relevant for designing rational administration 
guidelines for antibiotic therapies."
299,"SID1-like (SIL1) is considered as a core component in dsRNA uptake in some 
selected insect species. Investigation related to the potential function of SIL1 
in dsRNA uptake can contribute to a further understanding of RNAi mechanism in 
insects and agricultural pest control. However, the role of SIL1 in dsRNA uptake 
in insects such as aphids remains controversial. Thus, we have thoroughly 
analyzed the role of SIL1 from the model aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (ApSIL1) in 
cellular dsRNA to clarify its function. First, the induced expression of ApSIL1 
upon dsRNA oral exposure provided a vital clue for the possible involvement of 
ApSIL1 in cellular dsRNA uptake. Subsequent in vivo experiments using the 
RNAi-of-RNAi approach for ApSIL1 supported our hypothesis that the silencing 
efficiencies of reporter genes were reduced after inhibition of ApSIL1 
expression. The impaired biological phenotypes of aphids, including cumulative 
average offspring, deformities of the nymph, and mortality upon the pathogen 
infection were then observed in the treatment group. Thereafter, in vitro 
dual-luciferase reporter assay showed compelling evidence that the luciferin 
signal was significantly attenuated when dsluciferase or dsGFP was transferred 
into ApSIL1-transfected Drosophila S2 cells. These observations further 
confirmed that the signal of Cy3-labeled dsRNA was rapidly attenuated with time 
in ApSIL1-transfected Drosophila S2 cells. Overall, these findings conclusively 
establish that ApSIL1 is involved in dsRNA uptake in A. pisum. This article is

300,"Ras homologue family member C (RhoC) is an oncogene in diverse types of human 
cancers, whereas its regulatory mechanisms involving macrophage polarization is 
rarely investigated. This study is designed to explore the regulatory role of 
RhoC in colon cancer and the underlying molecular mechanisms involving 
macrophage polarization. We detected RhoC expression by quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot, and analysed the 
biological function of RhoC knockdown in CC cells by the MTT, wound healing and 
transwell assay. Macrophage polarization-associated markers, genes associated 
with migration, phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and forkhead box O 
(FOXO) were determined by qRT-PCR and western blot. The xenograft tumour mouse 
model was used to assess the role of RhoC in vivo. RhoC is highly expressed in 
CC cells. The cell viability, invasion and migration abilities of CC cells were 
reduced by knockdown of RhoC. RhoC knockdown promoted M1 polarization, inhibited 
M2 polarization and decreased levels of genes associated with migration (matrix 
metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9). Silencing of RhoC inhibited 
tumour growth and expression of genes associated with migration in the 
xenografted model. In addition, silencing of RhoC promoted PTEN/FOXO1 
expression, and PTEN inhibitor (SF1670) reversed the inhibitory effects of RhoC 
silencing. We demonstrated that silencing of RhoC reduced CC cells invasion and 
migration, and tumour growth by suppressing M2 macrophage polarization via 
regulating the PTEN/FOXO1 pathway."
301,"OBJECTIVE: Viral acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is the leading cause of work and 
school absence and antibiotic over-prescription. There are limited treatment 
options available to ameliorate the symptoms caused by viral ARS. We have 
previously demonstrated that topical adenosine treatment enhances mucociliary 
clearance in the sino-nasal tract. Here, we assessed the therapeutic potential 
of topical adenosine in a mouse model of viral ARS.
METHODS: The effect of topical adenosine on inflammatory response and mucin gene 
expression was examined in a mouse model of viral ARS induced by respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV) nasal-only infection. We also investigated the 
inflammatory effect of both endogenous and exogenous adenosine in the sino-nasal 
tract.
RESULTS: Topical adenosine significantly inhibited the expression of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, goblet hyperplasia, mucin expression, and cell 
damage in the nose of mice with viral ARS. This treatment did not prolong virus 
clearance. This inhibitory effect was primarily mediated by the A2A adenosine 
receptor (AR). Although previous studies have shown that adenosine induces a 
robust inflammatory response in the lungs, neither endogenous nor exogenous 
adenosine produced inflammation in the sino-nasal tract. Instead, exogenous 
adenosine inhibited the baseline expression of TNF and IL-1β in the nose. 
Additionally, baseline expression of ARs was lower in the nose than that in the 
trachea and lungs.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that intranasal adenosine administration effectively 
decreased inflammation and mucus production in a mouse model of viral ARS.

Sep5 and Pnut. Here, we report the crystal structure of the heterodimer formed 
between the G-domains of Sep1 and Sep2, the first from an insect to be described 
to date. A G-interface stabilizes the dimer (in agreement with the expected 
arrangement for the Drosophila hexameric particle) and this bears significant 
resemblance to its human counterparts, even down to the level of individual 
amino acid interactions. On the other hand, a model for the G-interface formed 
between the two copies of Pnut which occupy the center of the hexamer, shows 
important structural differences, including the loss of a highly favourable 
bifurcated salt-bridge network. Whereas wild-type Pnut purifies as a monomer, 
the reintroduction of the salt-bridge network results in stabilizing the dimeric 
interface in solution as shown by size exclusion chromatography and thermal 
stability measurements. Adaptive steered molecular dynamics (ASMD) reveals an 
unzipping mechanism for dimer dissociation which initiates at a point of 
electrostatic repulsion within the switch II region. Overall, the data 
contribute to a better understanding of the molecular interactions involved in 
septin assembly/disassembly. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

303,"The blood sample from 60 Damani does were collected and genomic DNA was 
extracted, and DNA integrity were investigated. A 447 bp promoter fragment of 
the GDF9 gene was amplified and Sanger sequenced for the identification of GDF9 
gene polymorphism. Three novel SNPs were identified at positions g. 97(T > A), 
g. 142 (G > G) and g. 313(C > T) in the promoter region of the caprine GDF9 gene 
which significantly (P < 0.05) influenced litter size, body measurement, and 
milk production traits in Damani goats. The genotype CT of SNP1 significantly 
(P < 0.05) improved litter size, genotype GG of SNP2 significantly (P < 0.05) 
enhanced milk production, while the genotypes CC of SNP3 significant (P < 0.05) 
increased body measurement traits in Damani goats. Moreover, in SNP1 loss of 3 
transcription factors (TF) binding sites occurred, SNP2 caused loss of two TFs 
binding sites, and SNP3 caused loss of a single TF binding site. Similarly, SNP1 
and SNP2 caused the gain of three new potential TF binding sites, and SNP3 
caused gain of two new TF binding sites. It is concluded that caprine GDF9 gene 
could be used as a candidate gene for litter size, milk production and body 
measurement traits in Damani goats through marker-assisted selection for future 
breeding program."
304,"Sea cucumber is a bioremediator as it can composite organic matter and excrete 
inorganic matter. Sea cucumber has the potential to serve as a bioindicator in 
marine habitat as they provide an integrated insight into the status of their 
environment over long periods. Sea cucumbers are sensitive to the organic 
concentration in the marine environment and can effectively provide an early 
warning system for any organic contamination that can negatively impact the 
ecosystem. The availability of a reference transcriptome for sea cucumber would 
constitute an essential tool for identifying genes involved in crucial steps of 
the defence pathway. De novo assembly of RNA-seq data enables researchers to 
study the transcriptomes without needing a genome sequence. In this study, sea 
cucumbers fed with Kappaphycus alvarezii powder were treated with 0.20 mg/L 
copper concentration comprehensive transcriptome data containing 75,149 
Unigenes, with a total length of 20,460,032 bp. A total of 8820 genes were 
predicted from the unigenes, annotated, and functionally categorized into 25 
functional groups with approximately 20% cluster in signal transduction 
mechanism. The reference transcriptome presented and validated in this study is 
meaningful for identifying a wide range of gene(s) related to the bioindication 
of sea cucumber in a high copper environment."
305,"BACKGROUND: Castration-resistance is common in advanced prostatic 
adenocarcinomas (PACs) treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and 
usually occurs after 2 years following treatment. A minority of PACs confer 
innate ADT resistance without prior hormonal treatment. The expression of HMWCK 
in PAC cells has not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the 
clinicopathologic and genomic features of HMWCK-expressing PACs and the 
relationship to ADT resistance.
METHODS: A total of 469 PACs were studied for HMWCK expression (39 
postradiotherapy, 57 post-ADT, 373 treatment-naïve PACs). Clinicopathologic 
correlations of the HMWCK expression with tumor grade groups, specific tumor 
morphologies, tumor stages and disease recurrence/persistence/progression were 
performed. Five HMWCK+ PACs were also sequenced for genetic alterations.
RESULTS: Thirty one of the 469 cases (6.6%) showed variable HMWCK+ PAC. The 
HMWCK+ PAC often focally presented in the tumor and vast majority were 
associated with high Gleason scores and unfavorable growth patterns (cribriform, 
comedo-necrosis, and intraductal carcinoma) as well as high tumor stages. A 
small percentage of the HMWCK+ PCA (2/31, 6.5%) presented with frank squamous 
histomorphology. Vast majority (22/31, 87%) had no history of prior ADT. The 
HMWCK+ PAC all displayed diminished to lost expression of AR/NKX3.1. Most of the 
cases progressed within 12 months of ADT or disease persisted despite ADT. Of 
the 5 HMWCK+ PACs subjected to gene sequencing, 4 presented with PTEN/PI3K/MAPK 
pathway alterations.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated HMWCK+ PAC to be a novel type of innate 
ADT-resistant PAC. Overexpression of HMWCK in PAC can be potentially used as a 
surrogate biomarker for aggressive and innate hormone-refractory PACs. The 
genetic alterations imply potential therapeutic implications of PI3K/MAPK 
inhibitors in the treatment of these deadly diseases."
306,"BACKGROUND: Like DNA methylation, histone modifications are considered important 
processes for epigenetic alterations in gene function, and abnormally high 
expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) plays a key role in many human 
diseases. In addition to regulating the acetylation levels of histone and 
non-histone proteins and gene transcription, HDAC inhibitors as antitumor drugs 
can also affect the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway in tumor cells. Prostate 
cancer (PCa) is one of the most heritable malignancies in which DDR pathway 
defects can be detected in a considerable proportion of cases. Such defects are 
more prevalent in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and are highly 
enriched in metastatic lesions. There is currently evidence that DDR 
pathway-deficient PCa is associated with high-risk biological behaviors and 
response sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. Platinum-based drugs have 
been used in multiple clinical trials as monotherapy or in combination with 
other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of CRPC.
METHODS: This study evaluated the combined anticancer effect of (cisplatin) CDDP 
and the HDAC inhibitors vorinostat (SAHA) on three androgen-dependent cell lines 
PC-3, DU-145, and C4-2B in vitro. The efficacy and safety of SAHA combined with 
CDDP in the treatment of CRPC were further verified through animal experiments.
RESULTS: The combination of the two drugs increases cytotoxic effects by 
increasing DNA damage. Our results showed that the SAHA could not only reduce 
the expression of homologous recombinant repair proteins BRCA2, BRCA1, PARP1, 
and RAD51, but also decrease enzymes that Reduce the key enzymes of GSH 
biosynthesis, GSS and GCLC, and GSTP1 which can catalyze the binding of GSH to 
cisplatin. The intracellular GSH level also decreased with the increase of SAHA 
concentration, at the same time, the content of intracellular Pt element.
CONCLUSION: The combination of CDDP and SAHA can produce synergistic anticancer 
effects in androgen-independent PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results open 
up a new avenue for the effective treatment of CRPC. To optimize the 
chemotherapy regimen for patients with advanced PCa, it is necessary to further 
study the molecular mechanism of platinum drugs, HDAC inhibitors, and their 
combined action."
307,"MOTIVATION: Missing data and incomplete lineage sorting are two major obstacles 
to accurate species tree inference. Gene tree summary methods such as ASTRAL and 
ASTRID have been developed to account for incomplete lineage sorting. However, 
they can be severely affected by high levels of missing data.
RESULTS: We present Asteroid, a novel algorithm that infers an unrooted species 
tree from a set of unrooted gene trees. We show on both empirical and simulated 
datasets that Asteroid is substantially more accurate than ASTRAL and ASTRID for 
very high proportions (>80%) of missing data. Asteroid is several orders of 
magnitude faster than ASTRAL for datasets that contain thousands of genes. It 
offers advanced features such as parallelization, support value computation, and 
support for multi-copy and multifurcating gene trees.

308,"In advanced HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC), the new antibody-drug 
conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is more effective compared to 
trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). However, T-DXd can have significant toxicities, 
and the right treatment sequence is unknown. Biomarkers to guide the use of 
anti-HER2 therapies beyond HER2 status are needed. Here, we evaluated if 
pre-established levels of ERBB2 mRNA expression according to the HER2DX 
standardized assay are associated with response and survival following T-DM1. In 
ERBB2 low, medium, and high groups, the overall response rate was 0%, 29% and 
56%, respectively (P<.001). ERBB2 mRNA was significantly associated with better 
progression-free survival (p = 0.002) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.02). These 
findings were independent of HER2 IHC levels, hormone receptor, age, brain 
metastasis and line of therapy. The HER2DX risk-score (P=.04) and the 
immunoglobulin (IGG) signature (P=.04) were significantly associated with OS 
since diagnosis. HER2DX provides prognostic and predictive information following 
T-DM1 in advanced HER2+ BC."
309,"MOTIVATION: As non-coding driver mutations move more into the focus of cancer 
research, a comprehensive and easy to use software solution for regulatory 
variant analysis and data visualization is highly relevant. The interpretation 
of regulatory variants in large tumor genome cohorts requires specialized 
analysis and visualization of multiple layers of data, including for example 
breakpoints of structural variants, enhancer elements and additional available 
gene locus annotation, in the context of changes in gene expression.
RESULTS: We introduce a user-friendly tool, Revana (REgulatory Variant 
ANAlysis), that can aggregate and visually represent regulatory variants from 
cancer genomes in a gene-centric manner. It requires whole genome (WGS) and RNA 
sequencing (RNA-Seq) data of a cohort of tumor samples and creates interactive 
HTML reports summarizing the most important regulatory events.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Revana is implemented in R and JavaScript. It 
is available for download as an R package under

310,"MOTIVATION: In the training of predictive models using high-dimensional genomic 
data, multiple studies' worth of data are often combined to increase sample size 
and improve generalizability. A drawback of this approach is that there may be 
different sets of features measured in each study due to variations in 
expression measurement platform or technology. It is often common practice to 
work only with the intersection of features measured in common across all 
studies, which results in the blind discarding of potentially useful feature 
information that is measured in individual or subsets of studies.
RESULTS: We characterize the loss in predictive performance incurred by using 
only the intersection of feature information available across all studies when 
training predictors using gene expression data from microarray and sequencing 
datasets. We study the properties of linear and polynomial regression for 
imputing discarded features and demonstrate improvements in the external 
performance of prediction functions through simulation and in gene expression 
data collected on breast cancer patients. To improve this process, we propose a 
pairwise strategy that applies any imputation algorithm to two studies at a time 
and averages imputed features across pairs. We demonstrate that the pairwise 
strategy is preferable to first merging all datasets together and imputing any 
resulting missing features. Finally, we provide insights on which subsets of 
intersected and study-specific features should be used so that missing-feature 
imputation best promotes cross-study replicability.

311,"BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide is a critical endogenous signaling molecule that 
exerts protective effects in the setting of heart failure. Cystathionine γ-lyase 
(CSE), 1 of 3 hydrogen-sulfide-producing enzyme, is predominantly localized in 
the vascular endothelium. The interaction between the endothelial CSE-hydrogen 
sulfide axis and endothelial-mesenchymal transition, an important pathological 
process contributing to the formation of fibrosis, has yet to be investigated.
METHODS: Endothelial-cell-specific CSE knockout and Endothelial cell-CSE 
overexpressing mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction to induce 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Cardiac function, vascular 
reactivity, and treadmill exercise capacity after transverse aortic constriction 
were measured to determine the severity of heart failure. Histological and gene 
expression analyses were performed to investigate changes in cardiac fibrosis 
and endothelial-mesenchymal transition activation.
RESULTS: Endothelial-cell-specific CSE knockout mice exhibited increased 
endothelial-mesenchymal transition and reduced nitric oxide bioavailability in 
the myocardium, which was associated with increased cardiac fibrosis, impaired 
cardiac and vascular function, and worsened exercise performance. In contrast, 
genetic overexpression of CSE in endothelial cells led to increased myocardial 
nitric oxide, decreased endothelial-mesenchymal transition and cardiac fibrosis, 
preserved cardiac and endothelial function, and improved exercise capacity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that endothelial CSE modulates 
endothelial-mesenchymal transition and ameliorate the severity of 
pressure-overload-induced heart failure, in part, through nitric oxide-related 
mechanisms. These data further suggest that endothelium-derived hydrogen sulfide 
is a potential therapeutic for the treatment of heart failure with reduced 
ejection fraction."
312,"This work describes the genetic transformation of a strain of Aspergillus niger 
with five different constructs containing 16 different heterologous genes coding 
for four oxidoreductases, two cellobiohydrolases, one endoglucanase, one 
β-glucosidase, six enzymes involved in xylose metabolism and two enzymes 
involved in fermentation. The aim was to try and engineer a consolidated 
bioprocessing in A. niger. The fungus already contains most of these enzymes and 
we only enhanced endogenous activities. We recovered nine transformants 
containing all genes, as indicated by PCR. To confirm that the products of the 
genes were functional, we measured the activity of five different enzymes in all 
the strains and they all showed enhanced activity over the wild type [wt] 
strain. The strains were grown on CMC and xylan as substrates and they produced 
considerably more ethanol than the wt. The levels of ethanol production were 
comparable to those reported in the literature. Aspergillus niger was 
transformed with four oxidoreductases, two cellobiohydrolases, one 
endoglucanase, one β-glucosidase, six enzymes involved in xylose metabolism and 
two enzymes involved in fermentation from different fungi with the aim to 
enhance ethanol production. Several enzyme activities related to lignocellulose 
hydrolysis were markedly enhanced as a result of the transformation. This

313,"BACKGROUND: Despite high vaccination rates, the United States has experienced a 
resurgence in reported cases of pertussis after switching to the acellular 
pertussis (aP) vaccine, indicating a need for improved vaccines that enhance 
infection control.
METHODS: Bordetella pertussis antigens recognized by convalescent-baboon serum 
and nasopharyngeal wash were identified by immunoproteomics and their 
subcellular localization predicted. Genes essential or important for persistence 
in the baboon airway were identified by Transposon Directed Insertion-Site 
Sequencing (TraDIS) analysis.
RESULTS: 314 B. pertussis antigens were identified by convalescent baboon serum 
and 748 by nasophyngeal wash. Thirteen antigens were identified as immunogenic 
in baboons, essential for persistence in the airway by TraDIS, and 
membrane-localized: BP0840 (OmpP), Pal, OmpA2, BP1485, BamA, Pcp, MlaA, YfgL, 
BP2197, BP1569, MlaD, ComL, and BP0183.
CONCLUSION: The B. pertussis antigens identified as immunogenic, essential for 
persistence in the airway, and membrane-localized warrant further investigation 
for inclusion in vaccines designed to reduce or prevent carriage of bacteria in 
the airway of vaccinated individuals."
314,"Ion channels regulate a large number of cellular functions and their functional 
role in many diseases makes them potential therapeutic targets. Given their 
diverse distribution across multiple organs, the roles of ion channels, 
particularly in age-associated transcriptomic changes in specific organs, are 
yet to be fully revealed. Using RNA-seq data, we investigated the rat 
transcriptomic profiles of ion channel genes across 11 organs/tissues and 4 
developmental stages in both sexes of Fischer 344 rats and identify 
tissue-specific and age-dependent changes in ion channel gene expression. 
Organ-enriched ion channel genes were identified. In particular, the brain 
showed higher tissue-specificity of ion channel genes, including Gabrd, Gabra6, 
Gabrg2, Grin2a, and Grin2b. Notably, age-dependent changes in ion channel gene 
expression were prominently observed in the thymus, including in Aqp1, Clcn4, 
Hvcn1, Itpr1, Kcng2, Kcnj11, Kcnn3, and Trpm2. Our comprehensive study of ion 
channel gene expression will serve as a primary resource for biological studies 
of aging-related diseases caused by abnormal ion channel functions."
315,"This study aimed to observe the protective effect of momordicine I, a 
triterpenoid compound extracted from momordica charantia L., on isoproterenol 
(ISO)-induced hypertrophy in rat H9c2 cardiomyocytes and investigate its 
potential mechanism. Treatment with 10 μM ISO induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy 
as evidenced by increased cell surface area and protein content as well as 
pronounced upregulation of fetal genes including atrial natriuretic peptide, 
β-myosin heavy chain, and α-skeletal actin; however, those responses were 
markedly attenuated by treatment with 12.5 μg/ml momordicine I. Transcriptome 
experiment results showed that there were 381 and 447 differentially expressed 
genes expressed in comparisons of model/control and momordicine I 
intervention/model, respectively. GO enrichment analysis suggested that the 
anti-cardiomyocyte hypertrophic effect of momordicine I may be mainly associated 
with the regulation of metabolic processes. Based on our transcriptome 
experiment results as well as literature reports, we selected 
glycerophospholipid metabolizing enzymes group VI phospholipase A2 (PLA2G6) and 
diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGK-ζ) as targets to further explore the potential 
mechanism through which momordicine I inhibited ISO-induced cardiomyocyte 
hypertrophy. Our results demonstrated that momordicine I inhibited ISO-induced 
upregulations of mRNA levels and protein expressions of PLA2G6 and DGK-ζ. 
Collectively, momordicine I alleviated ISO-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, 
which may be related to its inhibition of the expression of glycerophospholipid 
metabolizing enzymes PLA2G6 and DGK-ζ."
316,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a kind of malignant tumor with high 
incidence and mortality in the digestive system. The aim of this study is to 
explore the function of lnc-ABCA12-3 in the development of ESCC and its unique 
mechanisms. RT-PCR was applied to detect gene transcription levels in tissues or 
cell lines like TE-1, EC9706, and HEEC cells. Western blot was conducted to 
identify protein expression levels of mitochondrial apoptosis and toll-like 
receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. CCK-8 and 
EdU assays were carried out to measure cell proliferation, and cell apoptosis 
was examined by flow cytometry. ELISA was used for checking the changes in 
glycolysis-related indicators. Lnc-ABCA12-3 was highly expressed in ESCC tissues 
and cells, which preferred it to be a candidate target. The TE-1 and EC9706 
cells proliferation and glycolysis were obviously inhibited with the 
downregulation of lnc-ABCA12-3, while apoptosis was promoted. TLR4 activator 
could largely reverse the apoptosis acceleration and relieved the proliferation 
and glycolysis suppression caused by lnc-ABCA12-3 downregulation. Moreover, the 
effect of lnc-ABCA12-3 on ESCC cells was actualized by activating the TLR4/NF-κB 
signaling pathway under the mediation of exosome. Taken together, the 
lnc-ABCA12-3 could promote the proliferation and glycolysis of ESCC, while 
repressing its apoptosis probably by regulating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway 
under the mediation of exosome."
317,"Carboplatin, an advanced anticancer drug with excellent efficacy against ovarian 
cancer, was developed to alleviate the side effects that often occur with 
cisplatin and other platinum-based compounds. Our study reports the in vitro 
characteristics, viability, and activity of cells expressing the inducible 
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene after carboplatin was conjugated with 
polysuccinimide (PSI) and administered in combination with other widely used 
anticancer drugs. PSI, which has promising properties as a drug delivery 
material, could provide a platform for prolonging carboplatin release, 
regulating its dosage, and improving its side effects. The iNOS gene has been 
shown to play an important role in both cancer cell survival and inhibition. 
Herein, we synthesized a PSI-carboplatin conjugate to create a modified 
anticancer agent and confirmed its successful conjugation. To ensure its 
solubility in water, we further modified the structure of the PSI-carboplatin 
conjugate with 2-aminoethanol groups. To validate its biological 
characteristics, the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 and normal ovarian Chinese 
hamster ovary cells were treated with the PSI-carboplatin conjugate alone and in 
combination with paclitaxel and topotecan, both of which are used in 
conventional chemotherapy. Notably, PSI-carboplatin conjugation can be used to 
predict changes in the genes involved in cancer growth and inhibition. In 
conclusion, combination treatment with the newly synthesized polymer-carboplatin 
conjugate and paclitaxel displayed anticancer activity against ovarian cancer 
cells but was not toxic to normal ovarian cancer cells, resulting in the 
development of an effective candidate anticancer drug without severe side 
effects."
318,"The poor outcome of advanced ovarian cancer under conventional therapy 
necessitates new strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy. β-glucosidase 
(encoded by GBA) is a lysosomal enzyme and is involved in sphingolipids 
metabolism. Recent studies revealed that β-glucosidase plays a role in cancer 
development and chemoresistance. In this work, we systematically evaluated the 
expression and role of GBA in ovarian cancer. Our work demonstrates that 
inhibition of β-glucosidase has therapeutic potential for ovarian cancer. Gene 
Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database, western blot and 
immunohistochemistry analyses of patient samples demonstrated that GBA mRNA and 
protein expression levels were significantly increased in ovarian cancer 
compared to normal tissues. Functional studies using gain-of- function and 
loss-of-function approaches demonstrated that GBA overexpression did not affect 
growth and migration but alleviated cisplatin's efficacy in ovarian cancer 
cells. In addition, GBA depletion resulted in growth inhibition, apoptosis 
induction, and enhancement of cisplatin's efficacy. Of note, we found that GBA 
inhibition specifically decreased receptor tyrosine kinase AXL level, leading to 
the suppression of AXL-mediated signaling pathways. Our data suggest that GBA 
represents a promising target to inhibit AXL signaling and overcome cisplatin 
resistance in ovarian cancer."
319,"Broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is one of the earliest domesticated 
crops and a valuable resource to secure food diversity and combat drought 
stresses under the global warming scenario. However, due to the absence of 
extant diploid progenitors, the polyploidy genome of broomcorn millet remains 
poorly understood. Here, we report the chromosome-scale genome assembly of 
broomcorn millet. We divided the broomcorn millet genome into two subgenomes 
using the genome sequence of Panicum hallii, a diploid relative of broomcorn 
millet. Our analyses revealed that the two subgenomes diverged at ~4.8 million 
years ago (Mya), while the allotetraploidization of broomcorn millet may have 
occurred about ~0.48 Mya, suggesting that broomcorn millet is a relatively 
recent allotetraploid. Comparative analyses showed that subgenome B was larger 
than subgenome A in size, which was caused by the biased accumulation of long 
terminal repeat LTR retrotransposons in the progenitor of subgenome B before 
polyploidization. Notably, the accumulation of biased mutations in the 
transposable element-rich subgenome B led to more gene losses. Although no 
significant dominance of either subgenome was observed in the expression 
profiles of broomcorn millet, we found the minimally expressed genes in P. 
hallii tended to be lost during diploidization of broomcorn millet. These 
results suggest that broomcorn millet is at the early stage of diploidization 
and that mutations likely occurred more on genes that were marked with lower 
expression levels."
320,"Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum, is a devastating 
disease in wheat (Triticum aestivum) that results in substantial yield losses 
and mycotoxin contamination. Reliable genetic resources for FHB resistance in 
wheat are lacking. In this study, we characterized glycoside hydrolase 12 (GH12) 
family proteins secreted by F. graminearum. We established that two GH12 
proteins, Fg05851 and Fg11037, have functionally redundant roles in F. 
graminearum colonization of wheat. Furthermore, we determined that the GH12 
proteins Fg05851 and Fg11037 are recognized by the leucine-rich-repeat 
receptor-like protein RXEG1 in the dicot Nicotiana benthamiana. Heterologous 
expression of RXEG1 conferred wheat responsiveness to Fg05851 and Fg11037, 
enhanced wheat resistance to F. graminearum and reduced levels of the mycotoxin 
deoxynivalenol in wheat grains in a Fg05851/Fg11037-dependent manner. In the 
RXEG1 transgenic lines, genes related to pattern-triggered plant immunity, the 
salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and anti-oxidative homeostasis signaling pathways 
were upregulated during F. graminearum infection. However, expression of these 
genes was not significantly changed during infection by the deletion mutant 
ΔFg05851/Fg11037, suggesting that the recognition of Fg05851/Fg11037 by RXEG1 
triggered plant resistance against FHB. Moreover, introducing RXEG1 into three 
other different wheat cultivars via crossing also conferred resistance to F. 
graminearum. Expression of RXEG1 did not have obvious deleterious effects on 
plant growth and development in wheat. Our study reveals that N. benthamiana 
RXEG1 remains effective when transferred into wheat, a monocot, which in turn 
suggests that engineering wheat with interfamily plant immune receptor 
transgenes is a viable strategy for increasing resistance to FHB."
321,"Beneficial interactions between plant-roots and Trichoderma spp. lead to a local 
and systemic enhancement of the plant immune system through a mechanism known as 
priming of defenses. In recent reports, we outlined a repertoire of genes and 
proteins differentially regulated in distant tissues of maize plants previously 
inoculated with Trichoderma atroviride. To further investigate the mechanisms 
involved in the systemic activation of plant responses, we continued evaluating 
the regulatory aspects of a selected group of genes when priming is triggered in 
maize plants. We conducted a time-course expression experiment from the 
beginning of the interaction between T. atroviride and maize roots, along plant 
vegetative growth and during Colletotrichum graminicola leaf infection. In 
addition to gene expression studies, the levels of jasmonic and salicylic acid 
were determined in the same samples for a comprehensive understanding of the 
gene expression results. Lastly, chromatin structure and modification assays 
were designed to evaluate the role of epigenetic marks during the long-lasting 
activation of the primed state of maize plants. The overall analysis of the 
results allowed us to shed some light on the interplay between the phytohormones 
and epigenetic regulatory events in the systemic and long-lasting regulation of 
maize plant defenses after Trichoderma inoculation."
322,"OBJECTIVE: Poly-L-Lactic Acid (PLLA) is a synthetic polymer which possesses 
biocompatible and biodegradable properties, and is widely used in the clinical 
filler material. This study focuses on the potential role of PLLA on the 
collagen production of dermal fibroblasts and its mechanism.
METHODS: The dermal fibroblast Hs60 was treated with different concentration of 
PLLA. RT-qPCR was conducted for the determination of mRNA levels of collagen 
type I (COL1) alpha 1 (COL1A1), COL1 alpha 2 (COL1A2), elastin, matrix 
metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), 
and TIMP-2. Procollagen Type I C-peptide (PIP) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit 
assay was carried out to analyze procollagen production. Western Blot was 
employed to examine the effect of PLLA and transforming frown factor (TGF-β) 
receptor-specific inhibitor (SB431542) on protein levels of COL1A1 and 
TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway related proteins.
RESULTS: With the increase of PLLA concentration, the production of procollagen 
gradually increased, and both protein and mRNA levels of COL1A1 and COL1A2 
gradually increased (p < 0.001). Elevated PLLA concentrations increased elastin, 
TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 levels and attenuated MMP-1 expression. PLLA increased TGF-β 
levels in a dose-dependently manner. p-Smad2 and p-Smad3 protein levels were 
also increased by PLLA, but the influences were reversed by SB431542 
(p < 0.001). Similarly, increased levels of COL1A1, COL1A2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 
caused by PLLA were significantly inhibited by SB431542, whereas MMP-1 was 
typically elevated (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Poly-L-Lactic Acid promotes the collagen production of dermal 
fibroblasts by activating the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. The findings may lay 
a foundation for clinical material applications of PLLA."
323,"Muscular dystrophies are a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders with a 
wide range of the clinical and genetic spectrum. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) 
has been on the rise to become the usual method of choice for molecular 
diagnosis in patients presenting with muscular dystrophy or congenital or 
metabolic myopathy phenotype. Here, we used a panel with 47 genes including not 
only muscular dystrophy but also myopathy-associated genes that had been used as 
a first-tier approach. A total of 146 patients who were referred to our clinic 
with the prediagnosis of muscular dystrophy and/or myopathy were included in the 
study. Dystrophin gene deletion/duplication was ruled out on the patients with a 
preliminary diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In this study, the 
molecular etiology of 67 patients was proved with the gene panel with a 
diagnostic yield of 46%. Causal variants were identified in 23 genes including 
CAPN3(11), DYSF(9), DMD(8), SGCA(5), TTN(4), LAMA2(3), LMNA(3), SGCB(3), 
COL6A1(3), DES (2), CAV3(2), FKRP(2), FKTN(2), ANO5, COL6A2, CLCN1, GNE, 
POMGNT1, POMGNT2, POMT2, SYNE1, TCAP, and FLNC with 16 novel variants. There 
were 27 patients with uncertain molecular results including the ones who had a 
variant of uncertain significance, who had only one heterozygous variant for an 
autosomal recessive disease, and the ones who had two variants in different 
genes. Molecular diagnosis in muscular dystrophy is essential to plan clinical 
management and choosing treatment options. Also, the results will affect the 
reproduction options. Targeted next-generation sequencing is a cost-effective 
method that reduces the WES requirements with a significant diagnostic rate."
324,"A cryptic plasmid (pTH32) was characterized from Tetragenococcus halophilus 32, 
an isolate from jeotgal, Korean traditional fermented seafood. pTH32 is 3,198 bp 
in size with G+C content of 35.84%, and contains 4 open reading frames (ORFs). 
orf1 and orf2 are 456 bp and 273 bp in size, respectively, and their translation 
products showed 65.16% and 69.35% similarities with RepB family plasmid 
replication initiators, respectively, suggesting the rolling-circle replication 
(RCR) mode of pTH32. orf3 and orf4 encodes putative hypothetical protein of 186 
and 76 amino acids, respectively. A novel Tetragenococcus-Escherichia coli 
shuttle vector, pMJ32E (7.3 kb, Emr), was constructed by ligation of pTH32 with 
pBluescript II KS(+) and an erythromycin resistance gene (ErmC). pMJ32E 
successfully replicated in Enterococcus faecalis 29212 and T. halophilus 31 but 
not in other LAB species. A pepA gene, encoding aminopeptidase A (PepA) from T. 
halophilus CY54, was successfully expressed in T. halophilus 31 using pMJ32E. 
The transformant (TF) showed higher PepA activity (49.8 U/mg protein) than T. 
halophilus 31 cell (control). When T. halophilus 31 TF was subculturd in MRS 
broth without antibiotic at 48 h intervals, 53.8% of cells retained pMJ32E after 
96 h, and only 2.4% of cells retained pMJ32E after 14 days, supporting the RCR 
mode of pTH32. pMJ32E could be useful for the genetic engineering of 
Tetragenococcus and Enterococcus species."
325,"Creating synthetic lines is the standard mating mode for commercial pig 
production. Traditional mating performance was evaluated through a strictly 
designed cross-combination test at the 'breed level' to maximize the benefits of 
production. The Duroc-Landrace-Yorkshire (DLY) three-way crossbred production 
system became the most widely used breeding scheme for pigs. Here, we proposed 
an 'individual level' genomic mating procedure that can be applied to commercial 
pig production with efficient algorithms for estimating marker effects and for 
allocating the appropriate boar-sow pairs, which can be freely accessed to 
public in our developed HIBLUP software at 
https://www.hiblup.com/tutorials#genomic-mating. A total of 875 Duroc boars, 350 
Landrace-Yorkshire sows and 3573 DLY pigs were used to carry out the genomic 
mating to assess the production benefits theoretically. The results showed that 
genomic mating significantly improved the performances of progeny across 
different traits compared with random mating, such as the feed conversion rate, 
days from 30 to 120 kg and eye muscle area could be improved by -0.12, -4.64 d 
and 2.65 cm2, respectively, which were consistent with the real experimental 
validations. Overall, our findings indicated that genomic mating is an effective 
strategy to improve the performances of progeny by maximizing their total 
genetic merit with consideration of both additive and dominant effects. Also, a 
herd of boars from a richer genetic source will increase the effectiveness of 
genomic mating further."
326,"Therapeutic application of vaccines to endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains 
uncertain. In this study, we aimed to identify potential tumor antigens for use 
in the development of an anti-tumor mRNA vaccine and clarify immune subtypes and 
their characteristics for immunotherapeutic application in heterogeneous EC by 
integrating multi-omics data. Importantly, four potential tumor antigen 
candidates-PGR, RBPJ, PARVG, and MSX1-were identified and significantly 
correlated with better overall survival, disease-free survival, and distinct 
antigen-presenting cell infiltration in EC. In addition, two different immune 
subtypes by consensus clustering analysis of the immune-related genes were 
identified. Patients with C2 immunophenotypes exhibited superior survival 
outcomes and ""hot"" immunoreactivity and harbored higher microsatellite 
instability scores and tumoral mutation burden but lower copy-number variation 
burden. Furthermore, the distinct expression of immunogenic cell death 
modulators and differential microenvironmental characteristics of immune-cell 
infiltration were also revealed between C1 and C2 immune-subtype tumors. 
Enrichment analysis of the co-expression of immune-related genes showed 
enrichment in immune response, immune cell-mediated immunity, and antigen 
processing pathways. These results indicated that these identified tumor 
antigens can be used for developing antitumor mRNA vaccines, and tumors with C2 
immunophenotypic characteristics demonstrated sensitivity and susceptibility to 
immunotherapy in EC."
327,"OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidences indicate that a distinct CD11c+ T-bet+ B cell 
subset termed age/autoimmune-associated B cells (ABCs) is the major pathogenic 
autoantibody producer in lupus. Human lupus is associated with significant 
metabolic alterations, but how ABCs orchestrate their typical transcription 
factors (TFs) and metabolic programs to meet specific functional requirements is 
unclear. Our goal is to characterize the metabolism of ABCs and identify the 
regulators of metabolic pathways for developing new therapies for ABC-mediated 
autoimmunity.
METHODS: We developed a T-bet-tdTomato reporter mouse strain to trace live 
T-bet+ B cells and adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells from Bm12 mice to induce 
lupus. Then CD11c+ tdTomato+ B cells were sorted and conducted RNA sequencing 
and extracellular flux assay. Metabolic restriction to constrain ABC formation 
was tested on human and mouse B cells. The metabolic intervention was conducted 
in the Bm12-induced lupus model.
RESULTS: ABCs exhibited a hypermetabolic state with enhanced glycolytic 
capacity. The increased glycolytic rate in ABCs was promoted by IFN-γ signaling. 
T-bet, a downstream TF of IFN-γ, regulated the gene program of the glycolysis 
pathway in ABCs by repressing the expression of Bcl6. Functionally, glycolysis 
restriction could impair ABC formation. The engagement of glycolysis promoted 
survival and terminal differentiation of antibody-secreting cells. 
Administration of glycolysis inhibitor ameliorated ABCs accumulation and 
autoantibody production in Bm12-induced lupus model.
CONCLUSION: T-bet can couple immune signals and metabolic programming to 
establish pathogenic ABC formation and functional capacities. Modulating ABC 
favored metabolic program could be a novel therapeutic approach for lupus. This

328,"Plastids communicate their developmental and physiological status to the nucleus 
via retrograde signaling, thus allowing nuclear gene expression to be adjusted 
appropriately. Signaling during plastid biogenesis and responses of mature 
chloroplasts to environmental changes are designated as biogenic' and 
'operational' controls, respectively. A prominent example of the investigation 
of biogenic signaling is the screen for gun (genomes uncoupled) mutants. 
Although the first five gun mutants were identified 30 years ago, the functions 
of GUN proteins in retrograde signaling remain controversial and that of GUN1 is 
hotly disputed. Here, we provide background information and critically discuss 
recently proposed concepts that address GUN-related signaling and some novel gun 
mutants. Moreover, considering heme as a candidate in retrograde signaling, we 
revisit the spatial organization of heme biosynthesis and export from plastids. 
Although this review focuses on GUN pathways, we also highlight recent progress 
in the identification and elucidation of chloroplast-derived signals that 
regulate the acclimation response in green algae and plants. Here, 
stress-induced accumulation of unfolded/misassembled chloroplast proteins evokes 
a chloroplast-specific unfolded protein response (cpUPR), which leads to changes 
in the expression levels of nucleus-encoded chaperones and proteases to restore 
plastid protein homeostasis. We also address the importance of 
chloroplast-derived signals for activation of flavonoid biosynthesis leading to 
the production of anthocyanins during stress acclimation through sucrose 
non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1 (SnRK1). Finally, a framework for the 
identification and quantification of intercompartmental signaling cascades at 
the proteomic and metabolomic levels is provided, and we discuss future 
directions in the dissection of organelle-nucleus communication."
329,"Gene regulation is central to all aspects of organism growth, and understanding 
it from large-scale functional datasets can provide a whole view of biological 
processes controlling complex phenotypic traits in crops. However, the 
connection between massive functional datasets and trait-associated gene 
discovery for crop improvement still lacks. Here, we constructed a wheat 
integrative gene regulatory network (wGRN) by using an updated genome annotation 
and combining diverse complementary functional datasets, including gene 
expression, sequence motif, transcription factor (TF) binding, chromatin 
accessibility, and evolutionarily conserved regulation. wGRN contains 7.2 
million genome-wide interactions covering 5,947 TFs and 127,439 target genes and 
was further verified using known regulatory relationships, condition-specific 
expression, gene functional information, and experiments. We used wGRN to assign 
genome-wide genes to 3,891 specific biological pathways and accurately 
prioritize candidate genes associated with complex phenotypic traits in 
genome-wide association studies. In addition, wGRN was used to enhance the 
interpretation of a spike temporal transcriptome dataset to construct 
high-resolution networks. We further unveiled novel regulators that enhance the 
predictive power of spike phenotypic traits using the machine learning method 
and contribute to the spike phenotypic differences among modern wheat 
accessions. An interactive webserver, wGRN (http://wheat.cau.edu.cn/wGRN), was 
finally developed for the community to explore gene regulations and discover 
trait-associated genes. Overall, this community resource establishes the 
foundation for using large-scale functional datasets to guide trait-associated 
gene discovery for crop improvement."
330,"To learn if orthologous mutations are temperature-sensitive in related species, 
we studied four C. briggsae mutations orthologous to alleles of important C. 
elegans genes. Both Cel-glp-4(bn2) and Cbr-glp-4(v473) are 
temperature-sensitive, causing sterility at 25°C. By contrast, Cel-fog-1 ( q253) 
is strongly ts , but its ortholog Cbr-fog-1(v442) causes a loss-of-function at 
all temperatures. Finally, the C. elegans glp-1 alleles bn18 and e2141 are ts 
sterile. However, their C. briggsae orthologs, Cbr-glp-1(v429) and 
Cbr-glp-1(v438) respectively, are wild-type at all temperatures. Thus, a ts 
mutation in one species provides clues about how to design ts alleles in 
another, but all theoretical outcomes are possible."
331,"KEY POINTS: LPP3 expression is reduced in patients with coronary artery disease 
(CAD). Loss of LPP3 in CAD is associated with an increase in the LPP3 inhibitor, 
miR-92a. Inhibition of LPP3 in the microvascular of healthy patients mimics the 
CAD FMD phenotype. Inhibition of miR-92a restores NO-mediated FMD in the 
microvasculature of CAD patients.
ABSTRACT: Microvascular dysfunction predicts adverse cardiovascular events 
despite absence of large vessel disease. A shift in the mediator of 
flow-mediated dilation (FMD) from nitric oxide (NO) to mitochondrial-derived 
hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) occurs in arterioles from patients with coronary 
artery disease (CAD). The underlying mechanisms governing this shift are not 
completely defined. Lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3) is a transmembrane 
protein that dephosphorylates lysophosphatidic acid, a bioactive lipid causing a 
receptor-mediated increase in reactive oxygen species. A single nucleotide 
loss-of-function polymorphism in the gene coding for LPP3 (rs17114036) is 
associated with elevated risk for CAD, independent of traditional risk factors. 
LPP3 is suppressed by miR-92a, which is elevated in the circulation of patients 
with CAD. Repression of LPP3 increases vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis 
in animal models. We investigated the role of LPP3 and miR-92a as a mechanism 
for microvascular dysfunction in CAD. We hypothesized that modulation of LPP3 is 
critically involved in the disease-associated shift in mediator of FMD. LPP3 
protein expression was reduced in left ventricle tissue from CAD relative to 
non-CAD patients (p = 0.004), with mRNA expression unchanged (p = 0.96). 
Reducing LPP3 expression (non-CAD) caused a shift from NO to H2 O2 (% maximal 
dilation: Control 78.1±11.4% vs Peg-Cat 30.0±11.2%; p<0.0001). miR-92a is 
elevated in CAD arterioles (Fold change: 1.9±0.0.1 p = 0.04), while inhibition 
of miR-92a restored NO-mediated FMD (CAD) and enhancing miR-92a expression 
(non-CAD) elicited H2 O2 -mediated dilation (p<0.0001). Our data suggests LPP3 
is crucial in the disease-associated switch in the mediator of FMD. Abstract

332,"The imaginal disc growth factor (IDGF), belonging to the glycoside hydrolase 18 
family, plays an important role in various physiological processes in insects. 
However, the detail physiological function of IDGF is still unclear. In this 
study, transcriptome analysis was performed on the fatbody isolated from staged 
control and BmIDGF mutant silkworm larvae. Transcriptional profiling revealed 
that the absence of BmIDGF significantly affected differentially expressed genes 
involved in tyrosine and purine metabolism, as well as multiple energy 
metabolism pathways, including glycolysis, galactose, starch, and sucrose 
metabolism. The interruption of BmIDGF caused similar and specific gene 
expression changes to male and female fatbody. Furthermore, a genome-scale 
metabolic network integrating metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets revealed 
11 pathways significantly altered at the transcriptional and metabolic levels, 
including amino acid, carbohydrate, uric acid metabolism pathways, insect 
hormone biosynthesis, and ABC transporters. In conclusion, this multiomics 
analysis suggests that IDGF is involved in gene-metabolism interactions, 
revealing its unique role in melanin synthesis and energy metabolism. This study 
provides new insights into the physiological function of IDGF in insects."
333,"BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is irreversible and fatal within 
3-5 years, with limited options for treatment. It is imperative to develop a 
symptom-based treatment that may increase the survival of ALS patients and 
improve their quality of life. Inflammation status, especially elevated 
interleukin 1β (IL1β), has been reported to play a critical role in ALS 
progression. Our study determined that neutralizing circulating IL1β slows down 
the progression of ALS in an ALS mouse model.
METHODS: The ALS mouse model was developed by microinjection of 
lentivirus-carrying OPTNE478G (optineurin, a mutation from ALS patients) into 
the intra-motor cortex of mice. Peripheral circulating IL1β was neutralized by 
injecting anti-IL1β antibody into the tail vein. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were carried out 
to determine the protein and gene expression levels of IL1β. TUNEL assay was 
used to assess the neural cell death. Immunofluorescent staining of MAP2 and 
CASP3 was accomplished to evaluate neuronal cell apoptosis. Glial fibrillary 
acidic protein staining was performed to analyze the number of astrocytes. 
Rotarod test, grip strength test, balance beam test, and footprint test were 
conducted to assess the locomotive function after anti-IL1β treatment.
RESULTS: The model revealed that neuroinflammation contributes to ALS 
progression. ALS mice exhibited elevated neuroinflammation and IL1β secretion. 
After anti-IL1β treatment, ALS mice revealed decreased neural cell death and 
astrogliosis and gained improved muscle strength and motor ability.
CONCLUSIONS: Blocking IL1β is a promising strategy to slow down the progression 
of ALS."
334,"Propagation through stem cuttings is a popular method world-wide for species 
such as fruit tree rootstocks and forest trees. Adventitious root (AR) formation 
from stem cuttings is crucial for effective and successful clonal propagation of 
apple rootstocks. Strigolactones (SLs) are newly identified hormones, involved 
in AR formation. However, the regulatory mechanisms underpinning this process 
remain elusive. In this study, weighted gene co-expression network analysis 
(WGCNA), and rooting assays using stable transgenic apple materials, revealed 
that MdBRC1 served as a key gene in the inhibition of AR formation by SLs. We 
have demonstrated that MdSMXL7 and MdWRKY6 synergistically regulated MdBRC1 
expression, depending on the interactions of MdSMXL7 and MdWRKY6 at the protein 
level downstream of SLs as well as the direct promoter binding on MdBRC1 by 
MdWRKY6. Furthermore, biochemical studies and genetic analysis revealed that 
MdBRC1 inhibited AR formation by triggering the expression of MdGH3.1 in a 
transcriptional activation pathway. Finally, our study not only proposes a novel 
component, MdWRKY6, that enables MdSMXL7 to regulate MdBRC1 during the process 
of SLs-controlled AR formation in apple, but also provides prospective target 
genes to enhance AR formation capacity using CRISPR technology, particularly in 
woody plants."
335,"Induced mutations are an essential source of genetic variation in plant 
breeding. EMS mutagenesis has been frequently applied, and mutants have been 
detected by phenotypic or genotypic screening of large populations. In this 
study, a rapeseed M2 population was derived from M1 parent cultivar ""Express"" 
treated with EMS. Whole genomes were sequenced from fourfold (4x) pools of 1,988 
M2 plants representing 497 M2 families. Detected mutations were not evenly 
distributed and displayed distinct patterns across the 19 chromosomes with lower 
mutation rates towards the ends. Mutation frequencies ranged from 32/Mb to 
48/Mb. On average, 284,442 single nucleotide polymorphisms per M2 DNA pool were 
found resulting from EMS mutagenesis. 55% were C→T and G→A transitions, 
characteristic for EMS induced ('canonical') mutations, whereas the remaining 
SNPs were 'non-canonical' transitions (15%) or transversions (30%). 
Additionally, we detected 88,725 high confidence insertions and deletions 
(InDels) per pool. On average, each M2 plant carried 39,120 canonical mutations, 
corresponding to a frequency of one mutation per 23.6 kb. Roughly 82% of such 
mutations were located either 5 kb upstream or downstream (~56%) of gene coding 
regions or within intergenic regions (26%). The remaining 18% were located 
within regions coding for genes. All mutations detected by whole-genome 
sequencing could be verified by comparison with known mutations. Furthermore, 
all sequences are accessible via the online tool ""EMS Brassica"" 
(http://www.emsbrassica.plantbreeding.uni-kiel.de/), which enables direct 
identification of mutations in any target sequence. The sequence resource 
described here will further add value for functional gene studies in rapeseed 
breeding."
336,"Somatic embryogenesis (SE) are widely used for studying the mechanisms of embryo 
development. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms especially 
in woody plants. Previous studies have revealed a SE system has been 
well-established for Cunninghamia lanceolata, but in a genotype-dependent manner 
which limits its application in practice. Here, we found that phytosulfokine 
(PSK), a plant peptide hormone, can not only increase SE efficiency, but also 
establish SE in those recalcitrant genotypes of C. lanceolata. PEM browning and 
determination of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) content by dichlorofluorescein (DCF) 
staining indicated that a reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst occurred rapidly 
after PEMs were transferred to the SE induction medium. Transcriptome analysis 
and qRT-PCR validation showed that PSK treatment helped to maintain ROS 
homeostasis by decreasing the activity of PRXs in the early SE induction. This 
appropriate redox microenvironment medicated by PSK treatment might be helpful 
for expression induction of SE related genes like WOX2 in the early SE 
induction. Further analyses suggested that PSK promotes C. lanceolata SE 
induction partially through the decreasing of H2 O2 levels which is necessary 
but not sufficient for SE induction in recalcitrant genotypes of C. lanceolata. 
Furthermore, heterologous overexpression of ClPSK in Arabidopsis led to an 
enhanced SE induction and resistance to H2 O2 stress. Taken together, our study 
identifies a biological function for the plant peptide hormone PSK, extends our 
knowledge about SE in woody trees and provides a valuable tool for establishing 
an efficient and genotype-independent SE system in C. lanceolata and other 
coniferous trees."
337,"Marsdenia tenacissima is a medicinal plant widely distributed in the 
calcium-rich karst regions of southwest China. However, the lack of a reference 
genome has hampered the implementation of molecular techniques in its breeding, 
pharmacology, and domestication. We generated the chromosome-level genome 
assembly in Apocynaceae using combined SMRT sequencing and Hi-C. The genome 
length was 381.76 Mb, with 98.9% of it found on 11 chromosomes. The genome 
contained 222.63 Mb of repetitive sequences and 21,899 predicted gene models, 
with a contig N50 of 6.57 Mb. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that M. tenacissima 
diverged from Calotropis gigantea at least 13.43 million years ago. Comparative 
genomics showed that M. tenacissima underwent ancient shared whole-genome 
duplication. This event, together with tandem duplication, contributed to 70.71% 
of gene-family expansion. Both pseudogene analysis and selective pressure 
calculations suggested calcium-related adaptive evolution in the M. tenacissima 
genome. Calcium-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly 
enriched in cell-wall-related processes. Domains (e.g., Fasciclin and Amb_all), 
and cis-elements (e.g., MYB and MYC) frequently occurred in the coding and 
promoter regions of cell-wall DEGs, respectively, and the expression levels of 
these genes correlated significantly with those of calcium-signal-related 
transcription factors. Moreover, calcium addition increased tenacissoside I, G, 
and H contents. The availability of this high-quality genome provides valuable 
genomic information for genetic breeding and molecular design and lends insights 
into the calcium adaptation of M. tenacissima in karst areas."
338,"Single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been a powerful 
technology for transcriptome analysis. However, the systematic validation of 
diverse computational tools used in scRNA-seq analysis remains challenging. 
Here, we propose a novel simulation tool, termed as Simulation of Cellular 
Heterogeneity (SimCH), for the flexible and comprehensive assessment of 
scRNA-seq computational methods. The Gaussian Copula framework is recruited to 
retain gene coexpression of experimental data shown to be associated with 
cellular heterogeneity. The synthetic count matrices generated by suitable SimCH 
modes closely match experimental data originating from either homogeneous or 
heterogeneous cell populations and either unique molecular identifier 
(UMI)-based or non-UMI-based techniques. We demonstrate how SimCH can benchmark 
several types of computational methods, including cell clustering, discovery of 
differentially expressed genes, trajectory inference, batch correction and 
imputation. Moreover, we show how SimCH can be used to conduct power evaluation 
of cell clustering methods. Given these merits, we believe that SimCH can 
accelerate single-cell research."
339,"BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae 
(KPC-KP) has spread worldwide and has become a major threat to public health. 
The restriction modification system provides an innate defence of bacteria 
against plasmids or transposons, while many different types of plasmid encoding 
the anti-restriction protein ArdA can specifically affect the restriction 
activity in bacteria.
OBJECTIVES: To detect the codistribution of ArdA and blaKPC-2 plasmids in KPC-KP 
and explore the molecular mechanism of ArdA promoting KPC-KP spread.
METHODS: We collected 65 clinical CRKP isolates from Ningbo, China, and 68 cases 
of plasmid complete sequences in GenBank to determine the prevalence of ArdA 
gene on the K. pneumoniae blaKPC-2 plasmid. The anti-restriction function of 
ArdA in promoting horizontal gene transfer (HGT) was verified by transformation, 
conjugation and transduction methods, and the pull-down experiment was used to 
investigate the molecular mechanism of ArdA protein in vitro.
RESULTS: We found that ArdA was widely distributed in KPC-KP in 100% of cases, 
which was detected in 0% of drug susceptible K. pneumoniae, and the plasmids 
containing the ArdA gene in 90% of the 30 cases randomly retrieved from the 
database. We also verified that ArdA has a good anti-restriction function 
(P < 0.05) through two aspects of HGT (transformation, transduction), and 
explored the non-occurrence interaction of ArdA and the hsdM subunit protein of 
EcoKI enzyme from the perspective of protein molecules.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the coexistence advantage of ArdA with 
the blaKPC-2 plasmids may provide KPC-producing K. pneumoniae with a very 
efficient evasion of the restriction of type I systems, which not only favours 
ArdA-containing mobile genetic elements in the same species HGT between bacteria 
also facilitates HGT between other bacterial species."
340,"BACKGROUND: Rett syndrome (RTT), mainly caused by mutations in methyl-CpG 
binding protein 2 (MECP2), is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental 
disorders in girls. However, the underlying mechanism of MECP2 remains largely 
unknown and currently there is no effective treatment available for RTT.
METHODS: We generated MECP2-KO human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and 
differentiated them into neurons and cerebral organoids to investigate 
phenotypes of MECP2 loss-of-function, potential therapeutic agents, and the 
underlying mechanism by transcriptome sequencing.
RESULTS: We found that MECP2 deletion caused reduced number of hESCs-derived 
neurons and simplified dendritic morphology. Moreover, MECP2-KO cortical 
organoids exhibited fewer neural progenitor cells and neurons at day 60. 
Electrophysiological recordings showed that MECP2 deletion altered synaptic 
activity in organoids. Transcriptome analysis of organoids identified many genes 
in the PI3K-AKT pathway downregulated following MECP2 deletion. Treatment with 
either KW-2449 or VPA, small molecules for the activation of PI3K-AKT signaling 
pathway, alleviated neuronal deficits and transcriptome changes in MECP2-KO 
human neuronal models.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that KW-2449 and VPA might be promising 
drugs for RTT treatment."
341,"BACKGROUND: Considerable research has focussed on the importance of bacterial 
communities within the vertebrate gut microbiome (GM). However, studies 
investigating the significance of other microbial kingdoms, such as fungi, are 
notably lacking, despite their potential to influence host processes. Here, we 
characterise the fungal GM of individuals living in a natural population of 
Seychelles warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis). We evaluate the extent to which 
fungal GM structure is shaped by environment and host factors, including 
genome-wide heterozygosity and variation at key immune genes (major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) and Toll-like receptor (TLR)). Importantly, we 
also explore the relationship between fungal GM differences and subsequent host 
survival. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the genetic drivers and 
fitness consequences of fungal GM variation have been characterised for a wild 
vertebrate population.
RESULTS: Environmental factors, including season and territory quality, explain 
the largest proportion of variance in the fungal GM. In contrast, neither host 
age, sex, genome-wide heterozygosity, nor TLR3 genotype was associated with 
fungal GM differences in Seychelles warblers. However, the presence of four 
MHC-I alleles and one MHC-II allele was associated with changes in fungal GM 
alpha diversity. Changes in fungal richness ranged from between 1 and 10 
sequencing variants lost or gained; in some cases, this accounted for 20% of the 
fungal variants carried by an individual. In addition to this, overall MHC-I 
allelic diversity was associated with small, but potentially important, changes 
in fungal GM composition. This is evidenced by the fact that fungal GM 
composition differed between individuals that survived or died within 7 months 
of being sampled.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that environmental factors play a primary role 
in shaping the fungal GM, but that components of the host immune 
system-specifically the MHC-may also contribute to the variation in fungal 
communities across individuals within wild populations. Furthermore, variation 
in the fungal GM can be associated with differential survival in the wild. 
Further work is needed to establish the causality of such relationships and, 
thus, the extent to which components of the GM may impact host evolution. Video 
Abstract."
342,"BACKGROUND: DNA methylation profiling of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has 
rapidly become a promising strategy for biomarker identification and 
development. The cell-type-specific nature of DNA methylation patterns and the 
direct relationship between cfDNA and apoptosis can potentially be used 
non-invasively to predict local alterations. In addition, direct detection of 
altered DNA methylation patterns performs well as a biomarker. In a previous 
study, we demonstrated marked DNA methylation alterations in brain tissue from 
patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis 
(MTLE-HS).
RESULTS: We performed DNA methylation profiling in cfDNA isolated from the serum 
of MTLE patients and healthy controls using BeadChip arrays followed by 
systematic bioinformatic analysis including deconvolution analysis and 
integration with DNase accessibility data sets. Differential cfDNA methylation 
analysis showed an overrepresentation of gene ontology terms and transcription 
factors related to central nervous system function and regulation. Deconvolution 
analysis of the DNA methylation data sets ruled out the possibility that the 
observed differences were due to changes in the proportional contribution of 
cortical neurons in cfDNA. Moreover, we found no overrepresentation of neuron- 
or glia-specific patterns in the described cfDNA methylation patterns. However, 
the MTLE-HS cfDNA methylation patterns featured a significant overrepresentation 
of the epileptic DNA methylation alterations previously observed in the 
hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the use of cfDNA methylation profiling as a 
rational approach to seeking non-invasive and reproducible epilepsy biomarkers."
343,"BACKGROUND: Antibody affinity maturation in vertebrates requires the enzyme

diversification by mutating the immunoglobulin loci. AID-driven antibody 
diversification is conserved across jawed vertebrates since bony and 
cartilaginous fish. Two exceptions have recently been reported, the Pipefish and 
Anglerfish, in which the AID-encoding aicda gene has been lost. Both cases are 
associated with unusual reproductive behavior, including male pregnancy and 
sexual parasitism. Several cold water fish in the Atlantic cod (Gadinae) family 
carry an aicda gene that encodes for a full-length enzyme but lack 
affinity-matured antibodies and rely on antibodies of broad antigenic 
specificity. Hence, we examined the functionality of their AID.
RESULTS: By combining genomics, transcriptomics, immune responsiveness, and 
functional enzymology of AID from 36 extant species, we demonstrate that AID of 
that Atlantic cod and related fish have extremely lethargic or no catalytic 
activity. Through ancestral reconstruction and functional enzymology of 71 AID 
enzymes, we show that this enzymatic inactivation likely took place relatively 
recently at the emergence of the true cod family (Gadidae) from their ancestral 
Gadiformes order. We show that this AID inactivation is not only concordant with 
the previously shown loss of key adaptive immune genes and expansion of innate 
and cell-based immune genes in the Gadiformes but is further reflected in the 
genomes of these fish in the form of loss of AID-favored sequence motifs in 
their immunoglobulin variable region genes.
CONCLUSIONS: Recent demonstrations of the loss of the aicda gene in two fish 
species challenge the paradigm that AID-driven secondary antibody 
diversification is absolutely conserved in jawed vertebrates. These species have 
unusual reproductive behaviors forming an evolutionary pressure for a certain 
loss of immunity to avoid tissue rejection. We report here an instance of 
catalytic inactivation and functional loss of AID rather than gene loss in a 
conventionally reproducing vertebrate. Our data suggest that an expanded innate 
immunity, in addition to lower pathogenic pressures in a cold environment 
relieved the pressure to maintain robust secondary antibody diversification. We 
suggest that in this unique scenario, the AID-mediated collateral genome-wide 
damage would form an evolutionary pressure to lose AID function."
344,"BACKGROUND: Coleoid cephalopods have distinctive neural and morphological 
characteristics compared to other invertebrates. Early studies reported massive 
genomic rearrangements occurred before the split of octopus and squid lineages 
(Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 116:3030-5, 2019), which might be related to the 
neural innovations of their brain, yet the details remain elusive. Here we 
combine genomic and single-nucleus transcriptome analyses to investigate the 
octopod chromosome evolution and cerebral characteristics.
RESULTS: We present a chromosome-level genome assembly of a gold-ringed octopus, 
Amphioctopus fangsiao, and a single-nucleus transcriptome of its 
supra-esophageal brain. Chromosome-level synteny analyses estimate that the 
chromosomes of the ancestral octopods experienced multiple chromosome 
fission/fusion and loss/gain events by comparing with the nautilus genome as 
outgroup, and that a conserved genome organization was detected during the 
evolutionary process from the last common octopod ancestor to their descendants. 
Besides, protocadherin, GPCR, and C2H2 ZNF genes are thought to be highly 
related to the neural innovations in cephalopods (Nature 524:220-4, 2015), and 
the chromosome analyses pinpointed several collinear modes of these genes on the 
octopod chromosomes, such as the collinearity between PCDH and C2H2 ZNF, as well 
as between GPCR and C2H2 ZNF. Phylogenetic analyses show that the expansion of 
the octopod protocadherin genes is driven by a tandem-duplication mechanism on 
one single chromosome, including two separate expansions at 65 million years ago 
(Ma) and 8-14 Ma, respectively. Furthermore, we identify eight cell types (i.e., 
cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons) in the supra-esophageal brain of A. 
fangsiao, and the single-cell expression analyses reveal the co-expression of 
protocadherin and GPCR in specific neural cells, which may contribute to the 
neural development and signal transductions in the octopod brain.
CONCLUSIONS: The octopod genome analyses reveal the dynamic evolutionary history 
of octopod chromosomes and neural-related gene families. The single-nucleus 
transcriptomes of the supra-esophageal brain indicate their cellular 
heterogeneities and functional interactions with other tissues (i.e., gill), 
which provides a foundation for further octopod cerebral studies."
345,"BACKGROUND: Peer victimization is a crucial risk predictor for adolescent 
non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). However, adolescent NSSI reactions to peer 
victimization exhibit large individual differences. This study explored whether 
depression mediated the association between peer victimization and adolescent 
NSSI, and whether this mediating path was moderated by the 5-HTR2A gene rs6313 
polymorphism.
METHODS: A total of 667 adolescents (Meanage = 12.81, SD = 0.48) completed 
questionnaires regarding peer victimization, depression, and NSSI. Genomic DNA 
was extracted from saliva and buccal cells from each participant.
RESULTS: The results showed that the positive relation between peer 
victimization and adolescent NSSI was mediated by depression. Moreover, the 
triple interaction between peer victimization, rs6313 polymorphism, and gender 
on adolescent depression was significant. And the triple interaction between 
depression, rs6313 polymorphism, and gender on adolescent NSSI was also 
significant. Specifically, the risk effect of peer victimization on 
adolescent NSSI through increased depression was stronger for female adolescents 
with CC genotype than for female adolescents with CT or TT genotype, and male 
adolescents with CT or TT genotype. However, the indirect effect was 
nonsignificant for male adolescents with CC genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings promote the etiological understanding of adolescent 
NSSI, highlighting the mediating and moderating effect between peer 
victimization and NSSI, and adding evidence supporting the relationship between 
the 5-HTR2A gene rs6313 polymorphism, depression and adolescent NSSI."
346,"BACKGROUND: Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes 
(iPSC-CMs) do not display all hallmarks of mature primary cardiomyocytes, 
especially the ability to use fatty acids (FA) as an energy source, containing 
high mitochondrial mass, presenting binucleation and increased DNA content per 
nuclei (polyploidism), and synchronized electrical conduction. This immaturity 
represents a bottleneck to their application in (1) disease modelling-as most 
cardiac (genetic) diseases have a middle-age onset-and (2) clinically relevant 
models, where integration and functional coupling are key. So far, several 
methods have been reported to enhance iPSC-CM maturation; however, these 
protocols are laborious, costly, and not easily scalable. Therefore, we 
developed a simple, low-cost, and rapid protocol to promote cardiomyocyte 
maturation using two small molecule activators of the peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor β/δ and gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PPAR/PGC-1α) 
pathway: asiatic acid (AA) and GW501516 (GW). METHODS AND RESULTS: Monolayers of 
iPSC-CMs were incubated with AA or GW every other day for ten days resulting in 
increased expression of FA metabolism-related genes and markers for 
mitochondrial activity. AA-treated iPSC-CMs responsiveness to the mitochondrial 
respiratory chain inhibitors increased and exhibited higher flexibility in 
substrate utilization. Additionally, structural maturity improved after 
treatment as demonstrated by an increase in mRNA expression of 
sarcomeric-related genes and higher nuclear polyploidy in AA-treated samples. 
Furthermore, treatment led to increased ion channel gene expression and protein 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we developed a fast, easy, and economical method to 
induce iPSC-CMs maturation via PPAR/PGC-1α activation. Treatment with AA or GW 
led to increased metabolic, structural, functional, and electrophysiological 
maturation, evaluated using a multiparametric quality assessment."
347,"BACKGROUND: Obesity and related co-morbidities represent a major health 
challenge nowadays, with a rapidly increasing incidence worldwide. The gut 
microbiome has recently emerged as a key modifier of human health that can 
affect the development and progression of obesity, largely due to its 
involvement in the regulation of food intake and metabolism. However, there are 
still few studies that have in-depth explored the functionality of the human gut 
microbiome in obesity and even fewer that have examined its relationship to 
eating behaviors.
METHODS: In an attempt to advance our knowledge of the gut-microbiome-brain axis 
in the obese phenotype, we thoroughly characterized the gut microbiome 
signatures of obesity in a well-phenotyped Italian female cohort from the 
NeuroFAST and MyNewGut EU FP7 projects. Fecal samples were collected from 63 
overweight/obese and 37 normal-weight women and analyzed via a multi-omics 
approach combining 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, 
metatranscriptomics, and lipidomics. Associations with anthropometric, clinical, 
biochemical, and nutritional data were then sought, with particular attention to 
cognitive and behavioral domains of eating.
RESULTS: We identified four compositional clusters of the gut microbiome in our 
cohort that, although not distinctly associated with weight status, correlated 
differently with eating habits and behaviors. These clusters also differed in 
functional features, i.e., transcriptional activity and fecal metabolites. In 
particular, obese women with uncontrolled eating behavior were mostly 
characterized by low-diversity microbial steady states, with few and poorly 
interconnected species (e.g., Ruminococcus torques and Bifidobacterium spp.), 
which exhibited low transcriptional activity, especially of genes involved in 
secondary bile acid biosynthesis and neuroendocrine signaling (i.e., production 
of neurotransmitters, indoles and ligands for cannabinoid receptors). 
Consistently, high amounts of primary bile acids as well as sterols were found 
in their feces.
CONCLUSIONS: By finding peculiar gut microbiome profiles associated with eating 
patterns, we laid the foundation for elucidating gut-brain axis communication in 
the obese phenotype. Subject to confirmation of the hypotheses herein generated, 
our work could help guide the design of microbiome-based precision 
interventions, aimed at rewiring microbial networks to support a healthy 
diet-microbiome-gut-brain axis, thus counteracting obesity and related 
complications."
348,"BACKGROUND: SMYD3, a member of the SET and MYND domain-containing (SMYD) family, 
is a histone methyltransferase (HMT) and transcription factor that plays an 
important role in transcriptional regulation in human carcinogenesis.
RESULTS: Using affinity purification and mass spectrometry assays to identify 
SMYD3-associated proteins in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, we found 
several previously undiscovered SMYD3-interacting proteins, including the NuRD 
(MTA1/2) complex, the METTL family, and the CRL4B complex. Transcriptomic 
analysis of the consequences of knocking down SMYD3, MTA1, or MTA2 in HCC cells 
showed that SMYD3/NuRD complex targets a cohort of genes, some of which are 
critically involved in cell growth and migration. qChIP analyses showed that 
SMYD3 knockdown led to a significant reduction in the binding of MTA1 or MTA2 to 
the promoters of IGFBP4 and led to a significant decrease in H4K20me3 and a 
marked increase in H4Ac at the IGFBP4 promoter. In addition, we demonstrated 
that SMYD3 promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis in vivo and 
in vitro and found that its expression is markedly upregulated in human liver 
cancer. Knockdown of MTA1 or MTA2 had the same effect as knockdown of SMYD3 on 
proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Catalytic mutant 
SMYD3 could not rescue the phenotypic effects caused by knockdown of SMYD3. 
Inhibitors of SMYD3 effectively inhibited the proliferation and invasiveness of 
HCC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings revealed that SMYD3 could transcriptionally repress 
a cohort of target genes expression by associating with the NuRD (MTA1/2) 
complex, thereby promoting the proliferation and invasiveness of HCC cells. Our 
results support the case for pursuing SMYD3 as a practical prognostic marker or 
therapeutic target against HCC."
349,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing adaptation of plants to their environment is the basis 
for their survival. In this adaptation, mechanoperception of gravity and local 
curvature plays a role of prime importance in finely regulating growth and 
ensuring a dynamic balance preventing buckling. However, the abiotic environment 
is not the exclusive cause of mechanical stimuli. Biotic interactions between 
plants and microorganisms also involve physical forces and potentially 
mechanoperception. Whether pathogens trigger mechanoperception in plants and the 
impact of mechanotransduction on the regulation of plant defense remains however 
elusive.
RESULTS: Here, we found that the perception of pathogen-derived mechanical cues 
by microtubules potentiates the spatio-temporal implementation of plant immunity 
to fungus. By combining biomechanics modeling and image analysis of the 
post-invasion stage, we reveal that fungal colonization releases plant cell 
wall-born tension locally, causing fluctuations of tensile stress in walls of 
healthy cells distant from the infection site. In healthy cells, the 
pathogen-derived mechanical cues guide the reorganization of mechanosensing 
cortical microtubules (CMT). The anisotropic patterning of CMTs is required for 
the regulation of immunity-related genes in distal cells. The CMT-mediated 
mechanotransduction of pathogen-derived cues increases Arabidopsis disease 
resistance by 40% when challenged with the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.
CONCLUSIONS: CMT anisotropic patterning triggered by pathogen-derived mechanical 
cues activates the implementation of early plant defense in cells distant from 
the infection site. We propose that the mechano-signaling triggered immunity 
(MTI) complements the molecular signals involved in pattern and 
effector-triggered immunity."
350,"BACKGROUND: Animals form complex symbiotic associations with their gut microbes, 
whose evolution is determined by an intricate network of host and environmental 
factors. In many insects, such as Drosophila melanogaster, the microbiome is 
flexible, environmentally determined, and less diverse than in mammals. In 
contrast, mammals maintain complex multispecies consortia that are able to 
colonize and persist in the gastrointestinal tract. Understanding the 
evolutionary and ecological dynamics of gut microbes in different hosts is 
challenging. This requires disentangling the ecological factors of selection, 
determining the timescales over which evolution occurs, and elucidating the 
architecture of such evolutionary patterns.
RESULTS: We employ experimental evolution to track the pace of the evolution of 
a common gut commensal, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, within invertebrate 
(Drosophila melanogaster) and vertebrate (Mus musculus) hosts and their 
respective diets. We show that in Drosophila, the nutritional environment 
dictates microbial evolution, while the host benefits L. plantarum growth only 
over short ecological timescales. By contrast, in a mammalian animal model, L. 
plantarum evolution results to be divergent between the host intestine and its 
diet, both phenotypically (i.e., host-evolved populations show higher adaptation 
to the host intestinal environment) and genomically. Here, both the emergence of 
hypermutators and the high persistence of mutated genes within the host's 
environment strongly differed from the low variation observed in the host's 
nutritional environment alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that L. plantarum evolution diverges 
between insects and mammals. While the symbiosis between Drosophila and L. 
plantarum is mainly determined by the host diet, in mammals, the host and its 
intrinsic factors play a critical role in selection and influence both the 
phenotypic and genomic evolution of its gut microbes, as well as the outcome of 
their symbiosis."
351,"BACKGROUND: WRKY transcription factors play pivotal roles in regulating plant 
multiple abiotic stress tolerance, however, a genome-wide systematical analysis 
of WRKY genes in sweetpotato is still missing.
RESULTS: Herein, 84 putative IbWRKYs with WRKY element sequence variants were 
identified in sweetpotato reference genomes. Fragment duplications, rather than 
tandem duplications, were shown to play prominent roles in IbWRKY gene 
expansion. The collinearity analysis between IbWRKYs and the related orthologs 
from other plants further depicted evolutionary insights into IbWRKYs. 
Phylogenetic relationships displayed that IbWRKYs were divided into three main 
groups (I, II and III), with the support of the characteristics of exon-intron 
structures and conserved protein motifs. The IbWRKY genes, mainly from the group 
Ib, displayed remarkable and diverse expression profiles under multiple abiotic 
stress (NaCl, PEG6000, cold and heat) and hormone (ABA, ACC, JA and SA) 
treatments, which were determined by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR assays, suggesting 
their potential roles in mediating particular stress responses. Moreover, 
IbWRKY58L could interact with IbWRKY82 as revealed by yeast two-hybrid based on 
the protein interaction network screening. And abiotic stress-remarkably induced 
IbWRKY21L and IbWRKY51 were shown to be localized in the nucleus and had no 
transactivation activities.
CONCLUSION: These results provide valuable insights into sweetpotato IbWRKYs and 
will lay a foundation for further exploring functions and possible regulatory 
mechanisms of IbWRKYs in abiotic stress tolerance."
352,"BACKGROUND: Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN) accounts for a 
main cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic renal failure and uremia. 
This paper aimed to examine the effect of Ntrk1 on MsPGN development, so as to 
identify a novel therapeutic target for MsPGN.
METHODS: The MsPGN rat model was constructed by single injection of Thy1.1 
monoclonal antibody via the tail vein. Additionally, the Ntrk1 knockdown rat 
model was established by injection of Ntrk1-RNAi lentivirus via the tail vein. 
Periodic acid-schiff staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on 
kidney tissues. Moreover, the rat urinary protein was detected. Mesangial cells 
were transfected and treated with p38 inhibitor (SB202190) and ERK inhibitor 
(PD98059). Meanwhile, the viability and proliferation of mesangial cells were 
analyzed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays. 
Gene expression was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(qRT-PCR) and Western-blot (WB) assays.
RESULTS: The proliferation of mesangial cells was enhanced in glomerulus and 
Ki67 expression was up-regulated in renal tubule of MsPGN rats. The urine 
protein level increased in MsPGN rats. Pro-inflammatory factors and Ntrk1 
expression were up-regulated in glomerulus of MsPGN rats. Ntrk1 up-regulation 
promoted the viability, proliferation, expression of pro-inflammatory factors 
and activation of the STAT3, p38 and ERK signaling pathways in mesangial cells. 
Ntrk1 knockdown reduced mesangial cell proliferation, urine protein, 
pro-inflammatory factors, activation of STAT3, p38 and ERK signaling pathways in 
glomerulus, and decreased Ki67 expression in renal tubule of MsPGN rats. 
Treatment with SB202190 and PD98059 reversed the effect of Ntrk1 on promoting 
the viability, proliferation and inflammatory response of mesangial cells.
CONCLUSION: Ntrk1 promoted mesangial cell proliferation and inflammation in 
MsPGN rats by activating the STAT3 and p38/ERK MAPK signaling pathways."
353,"BACKGROUND: Uniconazole is an effective plant growth regulator that can be used 
in banana cultivation to promote dwarfing and enhance lodging resistance. 
However, the mechanisms underlying banana dwarfing induced by uniconazole are 
unknown. In uniconazole-treated bananas, gibberellin (GA) was downregulated 
compared to the control groups. An integrative analysis of transcriptomes and 
metabolomes was performed on dwarf bananas induced by uniconazole and control 
groups. The key pathways involved in uniconazole-induced dwarfism in banana were 
determined according to the overlap of KEGG annotation of differentially 
expressed genes and (DEGs) differential abundant metabolites (DAMs).
RESULTS: Compared with the control groups, the levels of some flavonoids, 
tannins, and alkaloids increased, and those of most lipids, amino acids and 
derivatives, organic acids, nucleotides and derivatives, and terpenoids 
decreased in uniconazole-treated bananas. Metabolome analysis revealed the 
significant changes of flavonoids in uniconazole-treated bananas compared to 
control samples at both 15 days and 25 days post treatment. Transcriptome 
analysis shows that the DEGs between the treatment and control groups were 
related to a series of metabolic pathways, including lignin biosynthesis, 
phenylpropanoid metabolism, and peroxidase activity. Comprehensive analysis of 
the key pathways of co-enrichment of DEGs and DAMs from 15 d to 25 d after 
uniconazole treatment shows that flavonoid biosynthesis was upregulated.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the decrease in GA, the increase in tannin 
procyanidin B1 may contribute to dwarfing of banana plants by inhibiting the 
activity of GA. The increased of flavonoid biosynthesis and the change of lignin 
biosynthesis may lead to dwarfing phenotype of banana plants. This study expands 
our understanding of the mechanisms underlying uniconazole-induced banana 
dwarfing."
354,"Phenotypic evolution is often caused by variation in gene expression resulting 
from altered gene regulatory mechanisms. Genetic variation affecting chromatin 
remodeling has been identified as a potential source of variable gene 
expression; however, the roles of specific chromatin remodeling factors remain 
unclear. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining the relationship 
between variation in gene expression, variation in chromatin structure, and 
variation in binding of the pioneer factor Grainy head between imaginal wing 
discs of two divergent strains of Drosophila melanogaster and their F1 hybrid. 
We find that (1) variation in Grainy head binding is mostly due to sequence 
changes that act in cis but are located outside of the canonical Grainy head 
binding motif, (2) variation in Grainy head binding correlates with changes in 
chromatin accessibility, and (3) this variation in chromatin accessibility, 
coupled with variation in Grainy head binding, correlates with variation in gene 
expression in some cases but not others. Interactions among these three 
molecular layers is complex, but these results suggest that genetic variation 
affecting the binding of pioneer factors contributes to variation in chromatin 
remodeling and the evolution of gene expression."
355,"Phototheranostics has received sustained attention due to its great potential in 
revolutionizing conventional strategies of cancer treatment. However, trapped by 
the complexity, poor reproducibility, insufficient phototheranostic outputs, and 
inevitable damage to normal tissue of most multicomponent phototheranostic 
systems, its clinical translation has been severely hindered. Therefore, the 
exploration of ""one for all"" smart phototheranostic agents with versatile 
functionalities remains an appealing yet enormously challenging task. Herein, a 
reversibly pH-switchable and near-infrared second photosensitizer featuring 
aggregation-induced emission was tactfully designed by molecular engineering for 
precise tumor-targeting fluorescence imaging-guided phototherapy. Thanks to the 
strong intramolecular charge transfer, enhanced highly efficient intersystem 
crossing, and sufficient intramolecular motion, the developed agent DTTVBI was 
endowed with boosted type-I superoxide anion radical generation and excellent 
photothermal performance under 808 nm laser irradiation. More importantly, 
DTTVBI nanoparticles with high biocompatibility exhibit remarkably enhanced 
type-I photodynamic/photothermal therapy in the tumor region, thus offering 
significant antitumor effects both in vitro and in the patient-derived tumor 
xenograft model of colon cancer. This work sheds new light on the development of 
superior versatile phototheranostics for cancer therapy."
356,"BACKGROUND: Fragaria nilgerrensis, which is a diploid wild strawberry with 
excellent drought-resistance, would provide useful candidate genes for improving 
drought resistance of cultivated strawberry. So far, its molecular regulatory 
networks involved in drought stress are unclear. We therefore investigated the 
drought response regulatory networks of F. nilgerrensis based on the integrated 
analysis of DNA methylation, transcriptome and physiological traits during four 
time points under drought stress.  RESULTS: The most differentially expressed 
genes and the physiological changes were found at 8 days (T8) compared with 
0 day (T0, control). Methylome analysis revealed slight dynamic changes in 
genome-wide mC levels under drought conditions, while the most hypomethylated 
and hypermethylated regions were identified at T4 and T8. Association analysis 
of the methylome and transcriptome revealed that unexpressed genes exhibited 
expected hypermethylation levels in mCHG and mCHH contexts, and highly expressed 
genes exhibited corresponding hypomethylation levels in the gene body, but mCG 
contexts showed the opposite trend. Then, 835 differentially methylated and 
expressed genes were identified and grouped into four clustering patterns to 
characterize their functions. The genes with either negative or positive 
correlation between methylation and gene expression were mainly associated with 
kinases, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) synthesis, scavenging, and the abscisic 
acid (ABA) signal pathway. Consistently, weighted gene co-expression network 
analysis (WGCNA) revealed Hub genes including NCED, CYP707A2, PP2Cs and others 
that play important roles in the ABA signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: F. nilgerrensis drought is dominated by ABA-dependent pathways, 
possibly accompanied by ABA-independent crosstalk. DNA methylation may affect 
gene expression, but their correlation was more subtle and multiple types of 
association exist. Maintaining the balance between ROS regeneration and 
scavenging is an important factor in drought resistance in F. nilgerrensis. 
These results deepen our understanding of drought resistance and its application 
in breeding in strawberry plants."
357,"BACKGROUND: As the amount of genomic data continues to grow, there is an 
increasing need for systematic ways to organize, explore, compare, analyze and 
share this data. Despite this, there is a lack of suitable platforms to meet 
this need.
RESULTS: OpenGenomeBrowser is a self-hostable, open-source platform to manage 
access to genomic data and drastically simplifying comparative genomics 
analyses. It enables users to interactively generate phylogenetic trees, compare 
gene loci, browse biochemical pathways, perform gene trait matching, create dot 
plots, execute BLAST searches, and access the data. It features a flexible user 
management system, and its modular folder structure enables the organization of 
genomic data and metadata, and to automate analyses. We tested OpenGenomeBrowser 
with bacterial, archaeal and yeast genomes. We provide a docker container to 
make installation and hosting simple. The source code, documentation, tutorials 
for OpenGenomeBrowser are available at opengenomebrowser.github.io and a demo 
server is freely accessible at opengenomebrowser.bioinformatics.unibe.ch .
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, OpenGenomeBrowser is the first self-hostable, 
database-independent comparative genome browser. It drastically simplifies 
commonly used bioinformatics workflows and enables convenient as well as fast 
data exploration."
358,"Hearing loss is a major health problem and psychological burden in humans. Mouse 
models offer a possibility to elucidate genes involved in the underlying 
developmental and pathophysiological mechanisms of hearing impairment. To this 
end, large-scale mouse phenotyping programs include auditory phenotyping of 
single-gene knockout mouse lines. Using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) 
procedure, the German Mouse Clinic and similar facilities worldwide have 
produced large, uniform data sets of averaged ABR raw data of mutant and 
wildtype mice. In the course of standard ABR analysis, hearing thresholds are 
assessed visually by trained staff from series of signal curves of increasing 
sound pressure level. This is time-consuming and prone to be biased by the 
reader as well as the graphical display quality and scale.In an attempt to 
reduce workload and improve quality and reproducibility, we developed and 
compared two methods for automated hearing threshold identification from 
averaged ABR raw data: a supervised approach involving two combined neural 
networks trained on human-generated labels and a self-supervised approach, which 
exploits the signal power spectrum and combines random forest sound level 
estimation with a piece-wise curve fitting algorithm for threshold finding.We 
show that both models work well and are suitable for fast, reliable, and 
unbiased hearing threshold detection and quality control. In a high-throughput 
mouse phenotyping environment, both methods perform well as part of an automated 
end-to-end screening pipeline to detect candidate genes for hearing involvement. 
Code for both models as well as data used for this work are freely available."
359,"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key modulators of 
inflammatory gene expression, but their roles in neuroinflammation are poorly 
understood. Here, we identified the inflammation-related lncRNAs and correlated 
mRNAs of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated human microglial cell line HMC3. 
We explored their potential roles and interactions using bioinformatics tools 
such as gene ontology (GO), kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), and 
weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).
RESULTS: We identified 5 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs, 4 of which 
(AC083837.1, IRF1-AS1, LINC02605, and MIR3142HG) are novel for microglia. The 
DElncRNAs with their correlated DEmRNAs (99 total) fell into two network modules 
that both were enriched with inflammation-related RNAs. However, treatment with 
the anti-inflammatory agent JQ1, an inhibitor of the bromodomain and 
extra-terminal (BET) protein BRD4, neutralized the LPS effect in only one 
module, showing little or even enhancing effect on the other.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide insight into, and a resource for studying, 
the regulation of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and its potential therapy 
by small-molecule BET inhibitors."
360,"BACKGROUND: The serum is rich in nutrients and plays an essential role in 
electrolyte and acid-base balance, maintaining cellular homeostasis. In 
addition, serum parameters have been commonly used as essential biomarkers for 
clinical diagnosis. However, little is known about the genetic mechanism of the 
serum parameters in ducks.
RESULTS: This study measured 18 serum parameters in 320 samples of the F2 
segregating population generated by Mallard × Pekin duck. The phenotypic 
correlations showed a high correlation between LDH, HBDH, AST, and ALT 
(0.59-0.99), and higher coefficients were also observed among TP, ALB, HDL-C, 
and CHO (0.46-0.87). And then, we performed the GWAS to reveal the genetic basis 
of the 18 serum biochemical parameters in ducks. Fourteen candidate 
protein-coding genes were identified with enzyme traits (AST, ALP, LDH, HBDH), 
and 3 protein-coding genes were associated with metabolism and protein-related 
serum parameters (UA, TG). Moreover, the expression levels of the above 
candidate protein-coding genes in different stages of breast muscle and 
different tissues were analyzed. Furthermore, the genes located within the 
high-LD region (r2 > 0.4 and - log10(P) < 4) neighboring the significant locus 
also remained. Finally, 86 putative protein-coding genes were used for GO and 
KEGG enrichment analysis, the enzyme-linked receptor protein signaling pathway 
and ErbB signaling pathway deserve further focus.
CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results can contribute to new insights into blood 
metabolism and provide new genetic biomarkers for application in duck breeding 
programs."
361,"BACKGROUND: Drought stress limits the production of soybean [Glycine max (L.) 
Merr.], which is the most grown high-value legume crop worldwide. Breeding for 
drought tolerance is a difficult endeavor and understanding the genetic basis of 
drought tolerance in soybean is therefore crucial for harnessing the genomic 
regions involved in the tolerance mechanisms. A genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) analysis was applied in a soybean germplasm collection (the EUCLEG 
collection) of 359 accessions relevant for breeding in Europe, to identify 
genomic regions and candidate genes involved in the response to short duration 
and long duration drought stress (SDS and LDS respectively) in soybean.
RESULTS: The phenotypic response to drought was stronger in the long duration 
drought (LDS) than in the short duration drought (SDS) experiment. Over the four 
traits considered (canopy wilting, leaf senescence, maximum absolute growth rate 
and maximum plant height) the variation was in the range of 8.4-25.2% in the 
SDS, and 14.7-29.7% in the LDS experiments. The GWAS analysis identified a total 
of 17 and 22 significant marker-trait associations for four traits in the SDS 
and LDS experiments, respectively. In the genomic regions delimited by these 
markers we identified a total of 12 and 16 genes with putative functions that 
are of particular relevance for drought stress responses including stomatal 
movement, root formation, photosynthesis, ABA signaling, cellular protection and 
cellular repair mechanisms. Some of these genomic regions co-localized with 
previously known QTLs for drought tolerance traits including water use 
efficiency, chlorophyll content and photosynthesis.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the mechanism of slow wilting in the SDS 
might be associated with the characteristics of the root system, whereas in the 
LDS, slow wilting could be due to low stomatal conductance and transpiration 
rates enabling a high WUE. Drought-induced leaf senescence was found to be 
associated to ABA and ROS responses. The QTLs related to WUE contributed to 
growth rate and canopy height maintenance under drought stress. Co-localization 
of several previously known QTLs for multiple agronomic traits with the SNPs 
identified in this study, highlights the importance of the identified genomic 
regions for the improvement of agronomic performance in addition to drought 
tolerance in the EUCLEG collection."
362,"Reprogramming Müller glia (MG) into functional cells is considered a promising 
therapeutic strategy to treat ocular diseases and vision loss. However, current 
AAV-based system for MG-tracing was reported to have high leakage in recent 
studies. Here, we focused on reducing the leakage of AAV-based labeling systems 
and found that different AAV serotypes showed a range of efficiency and 
specificity in labeling MG, leading us to optimize a human GFAP-Cre reporter 
system packaged in the AAV9 serotype with the woodchuck hepatitis virus 
post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) removed. The leakage ratio of the 
AAV9-hGFAP-Cre-ΔWPRE decreased by an approximate 40-fold compared with the 
AAV9-hGFAP-Cre-WPRE labeling system. In addition, we validated the specificity 
of the AAV-ΔWPRE system for tracing MG reprogramming under Ptbp1-suppression and 
observed strict non-MG-conversion, similar to previous studies using genetic 
lineage tracking mouse models. Thus, the AAV9-hGFAP-Cre-ΔWPRE system showed high 
efficiency and specificity for MG labeling, providing a promising tool for 
tracing cell fate in vivo."
363,"INTRODUCTION: Progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH) is a rare, debilitating 
disorder characterized by heterotopic ossification in the skin and muscles, 
resulting in contractures of the joints and progressive loss of function. While 
60-70% of the POH patients have paternally inherited, inactivating pathogenic 
variants in GNAS, the remaining 30-40% have no known etiology. FAM111B 
pathogenic variants, located on chromosome 11q12.1, cause POIKTMP (hereditary 
fibrosing poikiloderma with tendon contractures, myopathy, and pulmonary 
fibrosis), a very rare, autosomal-dominant disorder with high frequency of de 
novo missense pathogenic variants, which affects multiple tissues and organs, 
causing extensive fibrosis and muscle adiposis, though the exact mechanism is 
unknown. To our knowledge, there are no reports of FAM111B associated with POH. 
We describe the first case of POH phenotype associated with a novel de novo 
frameshift pathogenic variant in the FAM111B and present an analysis of the 
protein structure and function caused by this genomic disruption.
CASE: A 15-year-old African-American male presented with generalized calcific 
nodules, progressive contractures, and muscle weakness leading to immobility, 
beginning at 6 years of age. Cutaneous examination showed generalized hard 
nodules varying from small to plaque-like ulcerated erupted skin lesions. 
Biochemical evaluation revealed 25(OH) vitamin D insufficiency (20 ng/mL), and 
normal levels of parathyroid hormone, FGF-23, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and 
phosphorus. Skeletal survey radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of the 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed extensive soft tissue and muscle heterotopic 
ossifications involving shoulders, axillae, trunk, abdomen, pelvis, upper and 
lower extremities, in a clumped, conglomerate distribution within muscle, 
subcutaneous fat, and in some areas extending to the skin. There was no 
pulmonary fibrosis on the chest CT. The clinical and radiographic findings were 
most consistent with POH. A trio-clinical exome sequencing revealed a de novo 
heterozygous likely pathogenic variant in the FAM111B (OMIM # 615584) 
(c.1462delT [p.Cys488Valfs*21]). The resulted frameshift change in exon 4 
replaced C-terminal region with 21 alternative amino acids. Multiple, previously 
reported disease-associated variants appear to localize within the trypsin-like 
cysteine/serine peptidase domain in which this variant occurs, supporting the 
functional significance of this region, though none have been previously 
reported to be associated with POH phenotype. Our 3D protein modeling showed 
obliteration of predicted protein folding and structure, and elimination of the 
zinc-binding domain, likely severely affecting protein function.
CONCLUSION: This is the first case of POH phenotype associated with a novel de 
novo pathogenic frameshift variant in FAM111B. Whether the frameshift change in 
FAM111B predicts POH remains unclear. Further evaluations are necessary to fully 
elucidate this finding and the potential role and mechanism by which the FAM111B 
variants contributes to POH phenotype."
364,"Rumen inhabiting Bacillus species possesses a high genetic potential for plant 
biomass hydrolysis and conversion to value-added products. In view of the same, 
five camel rumen-derived Bacillus strains, namely B. subtilis CRN 1, B. 
velezensis CRN 2, B. subtilis CRN 7, B. subtilis CRN 11, and B. velezensis CRN 
23 were initially assayed for diverse hydrolytic activities, followed by genome 
mining to unravel the potential applications. CRN 1 and CRN 7 showed the highest 
endoglucanase activity with 0.4 U/ml, while CRN 23 showed high β-xylosidase 
activity of 0.36 U/ml. The comprehensive genomic insights of strains resolve 
taxonomic identity, clusters of an orthologous gene, pan-genome dynamics, and 
metabolic features. Annotation of Carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) reveals 
the presence of diverse glycoside hydrolases (GH) GH1, GH5, GH43, and GH30, 
which are solely responsible for the effective breakdown of complex bonds in 
plant polysaccharides. Further, protein modeling and ligand docking of annotated 
endoglucanases showed an affinity for cellotrioside, cellobioside, and 
β-glucoside. The finding indicates the flexibility of Bacillus-derived 
endoglucanase activity on diverse cellulosic substrates. The presence of the 
butyrate synthesis gene in the CRN 1 strain depicts its key role in the 
production of important short-chain fatty acids essential for healthy rumen 
development. Similarly, antimicrobial peptides such as bacilysin and 
non-ribosomal peptides (NRPS) synthesized by the Bacillus strains were also 
annotated in the genome. The findings clearly define the role of Bacillus sp. 
inside the camel rumen and its potential application in various plant biomass 
utilizing industry and animal health research sectors."
365,"PURPOSE: Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of regulated cell death (RCD) 
which was discovered to activate adaptive immunity. To date, the effect of ICD 
on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In this research, we will study 
the role of ICD-related genes (ICDG) in LUAD.
METHODS: RNA sequencing and clinical data were gathered from TCGA-LUAD cohorts 
and GEO database. Using unsupervised cluster analysis, three clusters were 
identified with distinctive immune characteristics and significant overall 
survival based on 18 ICDG. Using LASSO Cox regression, three genes were 
identified and used to construct the prognosis signature. The association 
between the 3-ICDG risk signature and immune microenvironment analysis, somatic 
mutation, and enriched molecular pathways was investigated.
RESULTS: Consensus clustering separated the LUAD samples into three clusters 
(ICDcluster A, B and C), and ICDcluster B had the best prognosis. Different TME 
cell infiltration characteristics and biological behavior were found in three 
ICD clusters. Prognostic risk model was contrasted based on the 3 best 
prognostic ICD-related genes. Subsequently, vitro experiments verified the above 
analysis results. The high-risk group showed a poor prognosis and enrichment of 
cancer promoting signal pathway. Multivariate analysis indicated that this 
3-ICDG prognostic model might be an accurate prediction parameter for LUAD. 
Moreover, conducting immune related analysis, we found that the 3-ICDG risk 
signature was characterized by an immune-active subtype on account of the high 
infiltration of immune-active cells.
CONCLUSION: This study expands our cognition of ICD in LUAD microenvironment, 
excavated prognostic biomarkers, and provided potential value for guiding 
immunotherapy and chemotherapy."
366,"AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver 
cancer. Expression defects and turnover of basement membrane (BM) proteins are 
key pathogenic factors in cancer. It is still uncertain how the expression of 
BM-related genes (BMGs) in HCC relates to prognosis.
METHODS: All of the HCC cohort's RNA-seq and clinical information came from TCGA 
datasets. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 
algorithm was utilized to filter down the candidate genes and construct the 
prognostic model. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were run to examine 
if the risk score may serve as a standalone prognostic indicator. The 
single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was utilized to analyze 
examine immune cell infiltration and pathway activity.
RESULTS: Five genes and their risk coefficients were eventually identified and 
patients with HCC were classified as either high or low risk based on the median 
of risk scores. Multivariate Cox regression analysis found a significant 
correlation between risk score and OS (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that 
BMGs signature had good prediction ability for HCC patients in age, gender, T 
stage, and AJCC stage (all p < 0.05). According to the ssGSEA, the high-risk 
subgroup showed higher levels of immune cell infiltration and immune-related 
pathways were more engaged in the high-risk group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our research systematically built a prognostic model using risk 
score based on BMGs signature in HCC patients. The immune feature analysis of 
the BMGs signature indicated a potential regulation between tumor immunity and 
BM in HCC."
367,"Renal cell carcinoma accounts for 2-3% of all cancers. It is difficult to 
diagnose early. Recently, genome-wide studies have identified that histone 
methylation was one of the functional classes that is most frequently 
dysregulated in renal cell cancer. Mutation or mis-regulation of histone 
methylation, methyltransferases, demethylases are associated with gene 
expression and tumor progression in renal cell cancer. Herein, we summarize 
histone methylations, demethylases and their alterations and mechanisms in renal 
cell cancer."
368,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are utilized as a carrier of 
anti-tumor agents in targeted anti-cancer therapy. Despite the improvements in 
this area, there are still some unsolved issues in determining the appropriate 
dose, method of administration and biodistribution of MSCs. The current study 
aimed to determine the influence of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulation on 
the potential of MSCs migration to the neoplasm environment in the mouse 
melanoma model.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) were isolated from the GFP+ 
transgenic C57BL/6 mouse and treated with different doses (1 µg/ml and 10 µg/ml) 
of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, the related TLR3 agonist, at various time 
points (1 and 4 h). Following the treatment, the expression of targeted genes 
such as α4, α5, and β1 integrins and TGF-β and IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokines 
was determined using real-time PCR. In vivo live imaging evaluated the migration 
index of the intraperitoneally (IP) injected treated ADMSCs in a lung 
tumor-bearing mouse (C57BL/6) melanoma model (n = 5). The presented findings 
demonstrated that TLR3 stimulation enhanced both migration of ADMSCs to the 
tumor area compared with control group (n = 5) and expression of α4, α5, and β1 
integrins. It was also detected that the engagement of TLR3 resulted in the 
anti-inflammatory behavior of the cells, which might influence the directed 
movement of ADMSCs.
CONCLUSION: This research identified that TLR3 activation might improve the 
migration via the stimulation of stress response in the cells and depending on 
the agonist concentration and time exposure, this activated pathway drives the 
migratory behavior of MSCs."
369,"Glioma is a primary brain tumor with limited treatment approaches and 
glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are manifested with the self-renewal capability 
and high tumorigenic capacity. This study was performed to investigate the 
regulatory effect of the SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1)/methyltransferase-like 
3 (METTL3)/MYC axis on the self-renewal of GSCs mediated by transcription factor 
Yin Yang 1 (YY1). Following bioinformatics analysis and clinical and cellular 
experiments, we found that YY1 was highly expressed in GBM tissues and cells, 
while silencing its expression reduced the self-renewal ability of GSCs. 
Functionally, YY1 promoted the transcriptional expression of SENP1 by binding to 
the promoter region of SENP1, while the deSUMOase SENP1 facilitated the 
methylase activity of m6A through deSUMOylation of the methylase METTL3, thereby 
promoting the m6A modification of MYC mRNA via METL3 and promoting the 
expression of MYC. A nude mouse xenograft model of GBM was also constructed to 
examine the tumorigenicity of GSCs. The obtained findings demonstrated that YY1 
promoted tumorigenicity of GSCs by promoting the expression of MYC in vivo. 
Conclusively, YY1 can transcriptionally upregulate the SUMOylase SENP1 and 
enhance the methylase activity of METTL3, resulting in the increased m6A 
modification level of MYC mRNA, thereby promoting the self-renewal of GSCs."
370,"Integration of high-dimensional tumor gene expression data with 
clinicopathological data can increase our understanding of disease diversity, 
enable retrospective patient stratification, and identify new potential 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Using a systems biology approach, we provide 
a holistic overview of gene co-expression networks in head and neck squamous 
cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis of HNSCC 
RNA sequencing data from 519 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was 
used to determine correlates of 5-year survival, using regression tree-based 
optimal threshold calculations. Survival-associated gene sets were transformed 
to gene set scores that were assessed for correlation with clinicopathological 
data. We identified 8 gene co-expression modules for HNSCC tumors, each of which 
contained co-expressed genes associated significantly with 5-year survival. 
Survival-associated co-expression gene signatures correlated dominantly with 
tumor HPV and p16 status. Network analysis identified that survival was 
associated with signaling networks of infection, immunity, 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, glycolysis, focal adhesion, 
extracellular matrix, MYC signaling, autophagy and transcriptional regulation. 
EMT-associated gene signatures were expressed dominantly in fibroblasts, and 
cancer-associated fibroblasts were inversely correlated with immune activity. 
Interestingly, a high Immune Suppression Score based on expression of 21 genes 
associated with immune inhibition and including immune checkpoints, cytokines 
and regulatory T cell factors, was also associated with increased survival 
probability, and was significantly higher in HPV+ HNSCC. Networks associated 
with HNSCC survival were further associated with survival in cervical cancer, 
melanoma and lung cancer. This study defines 5129 genes associated with HNSCC 
survival, organized into co-expressed networks, their correlation with 
clinicopathological data, and with gene expression data from other malignant 
diseases, and provides a source for the discovery of biomarkers and novel 
therapies for HNSCC."
371,"Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is crucial in regulating the immunological 
tolerance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alveolar macrophage 
(AM)-derived PD-L1 binds to its receptor, PD-1, on surveilling lymphocytes, 
leading to lymphocyte exhaustion. Increased PD-L1 expression is associated with 
cigarette smoke (CS)-exposure. However, the PD-L1 role in CS-associated lung 
diseases associated with NSCLC, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), is still unclear. In two different cohorts of ever smokers with COPD or 
NSCLC, and ever and never smoker controls, we evaluated PD-L1 expression: (1) 
via cutting-edge digital spatial proteomic and transcriptomic profiling (Geomx) 
of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung tissue sections (n = 19); and 
(2) via triple immunofluorescence staining of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) AMs 
(n = 83). PD-L1 mRNA expression was also quantified in BAL AMs exposed to CS 
extract. PD-L1 expression was increased in the bronchiolar wall, parenchyma, and 
vascular wall from mild-moderate (GOLD 1-2) COPD patients compared to 
severe-very severe (GOLD 3-4) COPD patients and controls. Within all the COPD 
patients, PD-L1 protein expression was associated with upregulation of genes 
involved in tumor progression and downregulation of oncosuppressive genes, and 
strongly directly correlated with the FEV1% predicted, indicating higher PD-L1 
expression in the milder vs. more severe COPD stages. In bronchioles, PD-L1 
levels were strongly directly correlated with the number of functionally active 
AMs. In BAL, we confirmed that AMs from patients with both GOLD 1-2 COPD and 
NSCLC had the highest and similar, PD-L1 expression levels versus all the other 
groups, independently from active cigarette smoking. Intriguingly, AMs from 
patients with more severe COPD had reduced AM PD-L1 expression compared to 
patients with mild COPD. Acute CS extract stimulation increased PD-L1 mRNA 
expression only in never-and not in ever-smoker AMs. Lungs from patients with 
mild COPD and NSCLC are characterized by a similar strong PD-L1 expression 
signature in bronchioles and functionally active AMs compared to patients with 
severe COPD and controls. Active smoking does not affect PD-L1 levels. These 
observations represent a new resource in understanding the innate immune 
mechanisms underlying the link between COPD and lung cancer onset and 
progression and pave the way to future studies focused on the mechanisms by 
which CS promotes tumorigenesis and COPD."
372,"Even when environmental variation over time and space is commonly considered as 
an important driver of population divergence, few evaluations of intraspecific 
genetic variation explicitly assess whether observed structure has been caused 
by or is correlated with landscape heterogeneity. Several phylogeographic 
studies have characterized the mitochondrial diversity of Abrothrix olivacea, 
but none has incorporated landscape genetics analyses and ecological niche 
modeling, leaving a gap in the understanding of the species evolutionary 
history. Here, these aspects were addressed based on 186 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms, extracted from sequences of 801 bp of Cytb gene, gathered from 
416 individuals collected at 103 localities in Argentina and Chile. Employing 
multivariate statistical analyses (gPCA, Mantel and Partial Mantel Tests, 
Procrustes Analysis, and RDA), associations between genetic differences and 
geographic and climatic distances were evaluated. Presence data was employed to 
estimate the potential geographic distribution of this species during historical 
and contemporary climatic scenarios, and to address differences among the 
climatic niches of their main mitochondrial lineages. The significant influence 
of landscape features in structuring mitochondrial variability was evidenced at 
different spatial scales, as well as the role of past climatic dynamics in 
driving geographic range shifts, mostly associated to Quaternary glaciations. 
Overall, these results suggest that throughout geographic range gene flow is 
unevenly influenced by climatic dissimilarity and the geographic distancing, and 
that studied lineages do not exhibit distributional signals of climatic niche 
conservatism. Additionally, genetic differentiation occurred by more complex 
evolutionary processes than mere disruption of gene flow or drift."
373,"Sertoli cells (SCs) preferentially use glucose to convert to lactate. As an 
energy source, lactate is essential for survival of developed germ cells (GCs) 
due to its anti-apoptotic effect. Failure to maintain lactate metabolism 
homeostasis leads to infertility or germ cell apoptosis. Several Sertoli 
cell-expressed genes, such as Foxq1 and Gata4, have been identified as critical 
regulators for lactate synthesis, but the pathways that potentially modulate 
their expression remain ill defined. Although recent work from our collaborators 
pointed to an involvement of STIP1 homology and U-box-containing protein 1 
(STUB1) in the modulation of Sertoli cell response to GCs-derived IL-1α, a true 
physiological function of STUB1 signaling in SCs has not been demonstrated. We 
therefore conditionally ablated Stub1 in SCs using Amh-Cre. Stub1 knockout males 
exhibited impaired fertility due to oligozoospermia and asthenospermia, possibly 
caused by lactate deficiency. Furthermore, by means of chromatin 
immunoprecipitation, in vivo ubiquitination, and luciferase reporter assays, we 
showed that STUB1 directed forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1)-mediated transactivation of 
the lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha) gene via K63-linked non-proteolytic 
polyubiquitination, thus facilitating lactate production in follicle-stimulating 
hormone (FSH)-stimulated SCs. In agreement, overexpression of LDHA by lentivirus 
infection effectively rescued the lactate production in TM4Stub1-/- cells. Our 
results collectively identify STUB1-mediated transactivation of FOXQ1 signaling 
as a post-translationally modified transcriptional regulatory network underlying 
nursery function in SCs, which may nutritionally contribute to Sertoli cell 
dysfunction of male infertility."
374,"Microbial rewilding, whereby exposure to naturalistic environments can modulate 
or augment gut microbiomes and improve host-microbe symbiosis, is being 
harnessed as an innovative approach to human health, one that may also have 
significant value to animal care and conservation. To test for microbial 
rewilding in animal microbiomes, we used a unique population of wild-born 
ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) that were initially held as illegal pets in 
unnatural settings and, subsequently, relocated to a rescue center in Madagascar 
where they live in naturalistic environments. Using amplicon and shotgun 
metagenomic sequencing of lemur and environmental microbiomes, we found multiple 
lines of evidence for microbial rewilding in lemurs that were transitioned from 
unnatural to naturalistic environments: A lemur's duration of exposure to 
naturalistic settings significantly correlated with (a) increased compositional 
similarly to the gut communities of wild lemurs, (b) decreased proportions of 
antibiotic resistance genes that were likely acquired via human contact during 
pethood, and (c) greater covariation with soil microbiomes from natural 
habitats. Beyond the inherent psychosocial value of naturalistic environments, 
we find that actions, such as providing appropriate diets, minimizing contact 
with humans, and increasing exposure to natural environmental consortia, may 
assist in maximizing host-microbe symbiosis in animals under human care."
375,"Extracellular tannase Lactiplantibacillus plantarum-producing strains (TanA+) 
release bioactive metabolites from dietary tannins. However, there is a paucity 
of knowledge of TanA+ strains and their hydrolyzing capacities. This study aimed 
to shed light on the metabolic and genomic features of TanA+ L. plantarum 
strains and to develop a screening technique. The established spectrophotometric 
was validated by UPLC-UV-QToF. Eight of 115 screened strains harbored the tanA 
gene, and six presented TanA activity (PROBI S126, PROBI S204, RKG 1-473, RKG 
1-500, RKG 2-219, and RKG 2-690). When cultured with tannic acid 
(a gallotannin), TanA+ strains released 3.2-11 times more gallic acid than a 
lacking strain (WCFS1) (p < 0.05). TanA+ strains with gallate decarboxylase 
(n = 5) transformed this latter metabolite, producing 2.2-4.8 times more 
pyrogallol than the TanA lacking strain (p < 0.05). However, TanA+ strains could 
not transform punicalagin (an ellagitannin). Genomic analysis revealed high 
similarity between TanA+ strains, as only two variable regions of phage and 
polysaccharide synthesis were distinguished. A phylogenetic analysis of 149 
additional genome sequences showed that tanA harboring strains form a cluster 
and present two bacteriocin coding sequences profile. In conclusion, TanA+ L. 
plantarum strains are closely related and possess the ability to resist and 
transform gallotannins. TanA can be screened by the method proposed herein."
376,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an effective target for those 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancers that retain the wild-type RAS gene. 
However, its efficacy in many cancers, including bladder cancer, is unclear. 
Here, we studied the in vitro effects of cetuximab monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
targeting EGFR on the bladder cancer cells and role of CD46. Cetuximab was found 
to inhibit the growth of both colon and bladder cancer cell lines. Furthermore, 
cetuximab treatment inhibited AKT and ERK phosphorylation in the bladder cancer 
cells and reduced the expression of CD46 membrane-bound proteins. Restoration of 
CD46 expression protected the bladder cancer cells from cetuximab-mediated 
inhibition of AKT and ERK phosphorylation. We hypothesized that CD46 provides 
protection to the bladder cancer cells against mAb therapies. Bladder cancer 
cells were also susceptible to cetuximab-mediated immunologic anti-tumor 
effects. Further, cetuximab enhanced the cell killing by activating both 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC) in bladder cancer cells. Restoration of CD46 expression 
protected the cells from both CDC and ADCC induced by cetuximab. Together, CD46 
exhibited a cancer-protective effect against both direct (by involvement of PBMC 
or complement) and indirect cytotoxic activity by cetuximab in bladder cancer 
cells. Considering its clinical importance, CD46 could be an important link in 
the action mechanism of ADCC and CDC intercommunication and may be used for the 
development of novel therapeutic strategies."
377,"Third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), including 
osimertinib, an irreversible EGFR-TKI, are important treatments for non-small 
cell lung cancer with EGFR-TKI sensitizing or EGFR T790M resistance mutations. 
While patients treated with osimertinib show clinical benefit, disease 
progression and drug resistance are common. Emergence of de novo acquired 
resistance from a drug tolerant persister (DTP) cell population is one mechanism 
proposed to explain progression on osimertinib and other targeted cancer 
therapies. Here we profiled osimertinib DTPs using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to 
characterize the features of these cells and performed drug screens to identify 
therapeutic vulnerabilities. We identified several vulnerabilities in 
osimertinib DTPs that were common across models, including sensitivity to MEK, 
AURKB, BRD4, and TEAD inhibition. We linked several of these vulnerabilities to 
gene regulatory changes, for example, TEAD vulnerability was consistent with 
evidence of Hippo pathway turning off in osimertinib DTPs. Last, we used genetic 
approaches using siRNA knockdown or CRISPR knockout to validate AURKB, BRD4, and 
TEAD as the direct targets responsible for the vulnerabilities observed in the 
drug screen."
378,"The chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein CHD8 is the most frequently 
mutated gene in autism spectrum disorder. Despite its prominent disease 
involvement, little is known about its molecular function in the human brain. 
CHD8 is a chromatin regulator which binds to the promoters of actively 
transcribed genes through genomic targeting mechanisms which have yet to be 
fully defined. By generating a conditional loss-of-function and an endogenously 
tagged allele in human pluripotent stem cells, we investigated the molecular 
function and the interaction of CHD8 with chromatin in human neurons. Chromatin 
accessibility analysis and transcriptional profiling revealed that CHD8 
functions as a transcriptional activator at its target genes in human neurons. 
Furthermore, we found that CHD8 chromatin targeting is cell context-dependent. 
In human neurons, CHD8 preferentially binds at ETS motif-enriched promoters. 
This enrichment is particularly prominent on the promoters of genes whose 
expression significantly changes upon the loss of CHD8. Indeed, among the ETS 
transcription factors, we identified ELK1 as being most highly correlated with 
CHD8 expression in primary human fetal and adult cortical neurons and most 
highly expressed in our stem cell-derived neurons. Remarkably, ELK1 was 
necessary to recruit CHD8 specifically to ETS motif-containing sites. These 
findings imply that ELK1 and CHD8 functionally cooperate to regulate gene 
expression and chromatin states at MAPK/ERK target genes in human neurons. Our 
results suggest that the MAPK/ERK/ELK1 axis potentially contributes to the 
pathogenesis caused by CHD8 mutations in human neurodevelopmental disorders."
379,"The function and underlying mechanisms of p50 in the regulation of protein 
expression is much less studied because of its lacking of transactivation 
domain. In this study, we discovered a novel function of p50 in its 
stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein under the 
condition of cells exposed to arsenic exposure. In p50-deficient (p50-/-) cells, 
the HIF-1α protein expression was impaired upon arsenic exposure, and such 
defect could be rescued by reconstitutional expression of p50. Mechanistic study 
revealed that the inhibition of autophagy-related gene 7 (ATG7)-dependent 
autophagy was in charge of p50-mediated HIF-1α protein stabilization following 
arsenic exposure. Moreover, p50 deletion promoted nucleolin (NCL) protein 
translation to enhance ATG7 mRNA transcription via directly binding 
transcription factor Sp1 mRNA and increase its stability. We further discovered 
that p50-mediated miR-494 upregulation gave rise to the inhibition of 
p50-mediated NCL translation by interacting with its 3'-UTR. These novel 
findings provide a great insight into the understanding of biomedical 
significance of p50 protein in arsenite-associated disease development and 
therapy."
380,"The prognosis of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive 
metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remained unsatisfactory currently, more anti-HER2 
agents are needed. Here we report a phase I study that evaluated the safety, 
activity, and biomarkers of LZM005, a HER2 antibody, used as a monotherapy or in 
combination with trastuzumab plus docetaxel in patients with HER2-positive MBC. 
From October 2017 to December 2019, 34 patients received LZM005 (14 monotherapy, 
20 combination therapy). No DLT was observed. The common adverse events (AEs) in 
phase Ia included diarrhea (21.4%), infusion reaction (21.4%), and 
hypertriglyceridemia (21.4%), while those in phase Ib were leukopenia (85.0%), 
neutropenia (75.0%), anemia (60.0%), diarrhea (60.0%), and rash/pruritus 
(50.0%). All AEs were manageable. In phase Ia, partial response (PR) was 
achieved in one case (1/14, overall response rate [ORR]: 7.1%); the disease 
control rate was 42.90% (6/14). In phase Ib, 11 patients (55.0%) achieved PR, 
and eight (40.0%) had stable disease. The ORR was 100% (6/6) in 
trastuzumab-naive and 35.7% (5/14) in trastuzumab-pretreated patients. Biomarker 
analysis showed that chromatin remodeling genes KMT2B and BRWD1 were associated 
with better progression-free survival. LZM005 is well tolerated and shows potent 
activity in patients with HER2-positive MBC."
381,"N6-deoxyadenosine methylation (6mA) is the most widespread type of DNA 
modification in prokaryotes and is also abundantly distributed in some 
unicellular eukaryotes. However, 6mA levels are remarkably low in mammals. The 
lack of a precise and comprehensive mapping method has hindered more advanced 
investigations of 6mA. Here, we report a new method MM-seq (modification-induced 
mismatch sequencing) for genome-wide 6mA mapping based on a novel detection 
principle. We found that modified DNA bases are prone to form a local open 
region that allows capture by antibody, for example, via a DNA breathing or 
base-flipping mechanism. Specified endonuclease or exonuclease can recognize the 
antibody-stabilized mismatch-like structure and mark the exact modified sites 
for sequencing readout. Using this method, we examined the genomic positions of 
6mA in bacteria (E. coli), green algae (C. reinhardtii), and mammalian cells 
(HEK239T, Huh7, and HeLa cells). In contrast to bacteria and green algae, human 
cells possess a very limited number of 6mA sites which are sporadically 
distributed across the genome of different cell types. After knocking out the 
RNA m6A methyltransferase METTL3 in mouse ES cells, 6mA becomes mostly 
diminished. Our results imply that rare 6mA in the mammalian genome is 
introduced by RNA m6A machinery via a non-targeted mechanism."
382,"Bacillus subtilis is a well-characterized microorganism and a model for the 
study of Gram-positive bacteria. The bacterium can produce proteins at high 
densities and yields, which has made it valuable for industrial bioproduction. 
Like other cell factories, metabolic modeling of B. subtilis has discovered ways 
to optimize its metabolism toward various applications. The first genome-scale 
metabolic model (M-model) of B. subtilis was published more than a decade ago 
and has been applied extensively to understand metabolism, to predict growth 
phenotypes, and served as a template to reconstruct models for other 
Gram-positive bacteria. However, M-models are ill-suited to simulate the 
production and secretion of proteins as well as their proteomic response to 
stress. Thus, a new generation of metabolic models, known as metabolism and gene 
expression models (ME-models), has been initiated. Here, we describe the 
reconstruction and validation of a ME model of B. subtilis, iJT964-ME. This 
model achieved higher performance scores on the prediction of gene essentiality 
as compared to the M-model. We successfully validated the model by integrating 
physiological and omics data associated with gene expression responses to 
ethanol and salt stress. The model further identified the mechanism by which 
tryptophan synthesis is upregulated under ethanol stress. Further, we employed 
iJT964-ME to predict amylase production rates under two different growth 
conditions. We analyzed these flux distributions and identified key metabolic 
pathways that permitted the increase in amylase production. Models like 
iJT964-ME enable the study of proteomic response to stress and the illustrate 
the potential for optimizing protein production in bacteria."
383,"The D,D-transpeptidase activity of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) is the 
well-known primary target of β-lactam antibiotics that block peptidoglycan 
polymerization. β-lactam-induced bacterial killing involves complex downstream 
responses whose causes and consequences are difficult to resolve. Here, we use 
the functional replacement of PBPs by a β-lactam-insensitive L,D-transpeptidase 
to identify genes essential to mitigate the effects of PBP inactivation by 
β-lactams in actively dividing bacteria. The functions of the 179 conditionally 
essential genes identified by this approach extend far beyond L,D-transpeptidase 
partners for peptidoglycan polymerization to include proteins involved in stress 
response and in the assembly of outer membrane polymers. The unsuspected effects 
of β-lactams include loss of the lipoprotein-mediated covalent bond that links 
the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan, destabilization of the cell envelope in 
spite of effective peptidoglycan cross-linking, and increased permeability of 
the outer membrane. The latter effect indicates that the mode of action of 
β-lactams involves self-promoted penetration through the outer membrane."
384,"Heart development is a continuous process involving significant remodeling 
during embryogenesis and neonatal stages. To date, several groups have used 
single-cell sequencing to characterize the heart transcriptomes but failed to 
capture the progression of heart development at most stages. This has left gaps 
in understanding the contribution of each cell type across cardiac development. 
Here, we report the transcriptional profile of the murine heart from early 
embryogenesis to late neonatal stages. Through further analysis of this dataset, 
we identify several transcriptional features. We identify gene expression 
modules enriched at early embryonic and neonatal stages; multiple cell types in 
the left and right atriums are transcriptionally distinct at neonatal stages; 
many congenital heart defect-associated genes have cell type-specific 
expression; stage-unique ligand-receptor interactions are mostly between 
epicardial cells and other cell types at neonatal stages; and mutants of 
epicardium-expressed genes Wt1 and Tbx18 have different heart defects. 
Assessment of this dataset serves as an invaluable source of information for 
studies of heart development."
385,"Introducing asexual reproduction through seeds - apomixis - into crop species 
could revolutionize agriculture by allowing F1 hybrids with enhanced yield and 
stability to be clonally propagated. Engineering synthetic apomixis has proven 
feasible in inbred rice through the inactivation of three genes (MiMe), which 
results in the conversion of meiosis into mitosis in a line ectopically 
expressing the BABYBOOM1 (BBM1) parthenogenetic trigger in egg cells. However, 
only 10-30% of the seeds are clonal. Here, we show that synthetic apomixis can 
be achieved in an F1 hybrid of rice by inducing MiMe mutations and egg cell 
expression of BBM1 in a single step. We generate hybrid plants that produce more 
than 95% of clonal seeds across multiple generations. Clonal apomictic plants 
maintain the phenotype of the F1 hybrid along successive generations. Our 
results demonstrate that there is no barrier to almost fully penetrant synthetic 
apomixis in an important crop species, rendering it compatible with use in 
agriculture."
386,"Mammalian cells frequently encounter subtle perturbations during recombinant 
protein production. Identifying the genetic factors that govern the cellular 
stress response can facilitate targeted genetic engineering to obtain production 
cell lines that demonstrate a higher stress tolerance. To simulate nutrient 
stress, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transferred into a 
glutamine(Q)-free medium and transcriptional dynamics using thiol(SH)-linked 
alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq) along with standard 
RNA-seq of stressed and unstressed cells were investigated. The SLAM-seq method 
allows to differentiate between actively transcribed, nascent mRNA and total 
(previously present) mRNA in the sample, adding an additional, time-resolved 
layer to classic RNA-sequencing. The cells tackle amino acid (AA) limitation by 
inducing the integrated stress response (ISR) signaling pathway, reflected in 
Atf4 overexpression in the early hours post Q deprivation, leading to subsequent 
activation of its targets, Asns, Atf3, Ddit3, Eif4ebp1, Gpt2, Herpud1, Slc7a1, 
Slc7a11, Slc38a2, Trib3, and Vegfa. The GCN2-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway is confirmed by 
a significant halt in transcription of translation-related genes at 24 hours 
post Q deprivation. The downregulation of lipid synthesis indicates the 
inhibition of the mTOR pathway, further confirmed by overexpression of Sesn2. 
Furthermore, SLAM-seq detects short-lived transcription factors, such as Egr1, 
that would have been missed in standard experimental designs with RNA-seq. Our 
results describe the successful establishment of SLAM-seq in CHO cells and 
therefore facilitate its future use in other scenarios where dynamic 
transcriptome profiling in CHO cells is essential. This article is protected by

387,"Accelerated approval based on a likely surrogate endpoint can be life-changing 
for patients suffering from a rare progressive disease with unmet medical need, 
as it substantially hastens access to potentially lifesaving therapies. In one 
such example, antisense morpholinos were approved to treat Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy (DMD) based on measurement of shortened dystrophin in skeletal muscle 
biopsies as a surrogate biomarker. New, promising therapeutics for DMD include 
AAV gene therapy to restore another form of dystrophin termed mini- or 
microdystrophin. AAV-microdystrophins are currently in clinical trials but have 
yet to be accepted by regulatory agencies as reasonably likely surrogate 
endpoints. To evaluate microdystrophin expression as a reasonably likely 
surrogate endpoint for DMD, this review highlights dystrophin biology in the 
context of functional and clinical benefit to support the argument that 
microdystrophin proteins have a high probability of providing clinical benefit 
based on their rational design. Unlike exon-skipping based strategies, the 
approach of rational design allows for functional capabilities (i.e. quality) of 
the protein to be maximized with every patient receiving the same optimized 
microdystrophin. Therefore, the presence of rationally designed microdystrophin 
in a muscle biopsy is likely to predict clinical benefit and is consequently a 
strong candidate for a surrogate endpoint analysis to support accelerated 
approval."
388,"Liddle syndrome is an inherited form of arterial hypertension with autosomal 
dominant pattern of inheritance. It is caused by activating mutation of genes 
coding of the epithelial sodium channel in distal nephron. Mutation leads to 
excessive reabsorbtion of sodium ions and volume expansion resulting in arterial 
hypertension. Antoher typical laboratory findings are hypokalaemia, low levels 
of serum aldosteron and metabolic alkalosis. Phenotypic variability makes it 
difficult to identify patients with Liddle syndrome, often resulting in 
misdiagnosis and severe complications at early age. Genetic studies should be 
done to confirm the diagnosis. Therapy of Liddle syndrome is based on 
administration of epithelial sodium channel blocker amilorid."
389,"The red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum is a resource-rich model for genomic 
and developmental studies. To extend previous studies on Tribolium eye 
development, we produced transcriptomes for normal-eyed and eye-depleted heads 
of pupae and adults to identify differentially transcript enriched (DE) genes in 
the visual system. Unexpectedly, cuticle-related genes were the largest 
functional class in the pupal compound eye DE gene population, indicating 
differential enrichment in three distinct cuticle components: clear lens facet 
cuticle, highly melanized cuticle of the ""ocular diaphragm"", which surrounds the 
Tribolium compound eye for internal fortification, and newly identified facet 
margins of tanned cuticle, possibly enhancing external fortification. 
Phylogenetic, linkage, and high throughput gene knockdown data suggest that most 
cuticle proteins (CP) expressed in the Tribolium compound eye stem from the 
deployment of ancient CP genes. Consistent with this, TcasCPR15, which we 
identified as the major lens CP gene in Tribolium, is a beetle-specific but 
pleiotropic paralog of the ancient CPR RR-2 CP gene family. The less abundant 
yet most likely even more lens-specific TcasCP63 is a member of a sprawling 
family of non-canonical CP genes, documenting a role of local gene family 
expansions in the emergence of the Tribolium compound eye CP repertoire. 
Comparisons with Drosophila and the mosquito Anopheles gambiae reveal a steady 
turnover of lens-enriched CP genes during insect evolution."
390,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an ER-localized transmembrane protein 
and the receptor for 2',3'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate&endash;adenosine 
monophosphate (cGAMP), which is a second messenger produced by cGAMP synthase 
(cGAS), a cytosolic double-stranded DNA sensor. The cGAS-STING pathway plays a 
critical role in the innate immune response to infection of a variety of DNA 
pathogens through the induction of the type I interferons. Pharmacological 
activation of STING is a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, thus the 
development of potent and selective STING agonists has been pursued. Here we 
report that mouse STING can be activated by phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a membrane 
permeable trivalent arsenic compound that preferentially reacts with thiol group 
of cysteine residue (Cys). The activation of STING with PAO does not require 
cGAS or cGAMP. Mass spectrometric analysis of the peptides generated by trypsin 
and chymotrypsin digestion of STING identifies several PAO adducts, suggesting 
that PAO covalently binds to STING. Screening of STING variants with single Cys 
to serine residues (Ser) reveals that Cys88 and Cys291 are critical to the 
response to PAO. STING activation with PAO, as with cGAMP, requires the 
ER-to-Golgi traffic and palmitoylation of STING. Our results identify a 
non-nucleotide STING agonist that does not target the cGAMP-binding pocket, and 
demonstrate that Cys of STING can be a novel target for the development of STING 
agonist.Key words: STING agonist, cysteine modification, innate immunity, 
phenylarsine oxide."
391,"Klebsiella oxytoca is an opportunistic pathogen that causes nosocomial 
infections. We describe an unusual clinical strain of indole-negative K. 
oxytoca, GU175, isolated from the urine of a patient with cystitis. The GU175 
strain was identified as K. pneumoniae with a probability of 99.40%, negative 
for indole production, and resistant to third-generation cephalosporins by using 
the MicroScan Walkaway 40 SI system with the Negative combo EN1 J panel. 
Biochemical characterization of this strain using a lysine-indole motility 
medium was negative for indole production. However, identification tests using 
the MALDI Biotyper system and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that 
GU175 was K. oxytoca. DNA sequence analysis of the tryptophanase operon 
comparing the GU175 strain with the revertant GU176 strain that tested positive 
for indole revealed a point mutation in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence upstream of 
tnaC in the GU175 strain. This is the first report of indole-negative K. 
oxytoca- attributed to a mutation in the DNA sequence of the tryptophanase 
operon- isolated from a patient with a urinary tract infection. Since 
indole-negative K. oxytoca can be misidentified as K. pneumoniae by biochemical 
characterization, clinical microbiologists should be aware of such 
misidentifications."
392,"3q27 chromosomal translocation involving the BCL6 gene is one of the most 
frequent forms of cytogenetic abnormality observed in B-cell lymphoma. We report 
a case with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) presenting dual 3q27 
translocations. The patient was a 71-year-old man who presented with swelling of 
multiple abdominal lymph nodes (LNs) and obstructive jaundice. LN biopsy 
exhibited dense proliferation of atypical large cells expressing CD20, 
MUM1/IRF4, BCL2, BCL6, and MYC, but not CD10. He was diagnosed with non-GCB/ABC 
type DLBCL and showed an initially good response to R-CHOP chemotherapy, but 
relapsed soon after the completion of therapy. Chromosomal analysis of the 
biopsied LN exhibited multiple abnormalities including t(3;14)(q27;q32) and 
t(3;22)(q27;q11). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using BCL6 
break-apart probes confirmed chromosomal breaks occurring on both BCL6 alleles. 
Molecular analysis revealed two independent rearrangements of BCL6, either with 
the IGH or the IGL gene. 3q27 breakpoints were located 1.2kb apart from each 
other within the first intron of BCL6, while the IGH and IGL breaks occurred at 
the 5' of IGHG2 and within IGLV3-1, respectively. The results suggest that 
biallelic BCL6 rearrangements might be a rare but recurrent genetic event in 
B-cell lymphoma."
393,"Biosecurity enhancement contributes to the reduction of various microbial 
pathogens. Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs) which are increasingly recognized as 
potentially serious problems on swine industry were used as indicators of 
biosecurity enhancement on two pig farms. Twelve MRVs were detected and isolated 
from fecal specimens of healthy pigs collected from one of two farms in Japan. 
By sequencing based on the partial S1 gene, MRV isolates were classified as MRV1 
and MRV2. Additionally, the virucidal activities of disinfectants toward the 
isolated MRV1 were evaluated using quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) diluted 
500 times with water (QAC-500), 0.17% food additive glade calcium hydroxide 
(FdCa(OH)2) solution, QAC diluted with 0.17% FdCa(OH)2 solution (Mix-500), 
sodium hypochlorite at 100 or 1,000 parts per million (ppm) of total chlorine 
(NaClO-100 or NaClO-1000, respectively). To efficiently inactivate MRV1 (≥ 3 
log10 reductions), 0.17% FdCa(OH)2, Mix-500 and NaClO-1000 required 5 min, 
whereas it took 30 min for QAC-500. The number of MRV detections has decreased 
over time, after using Mix-500 for disinfection on the positive farm. These 
results suggest that different serotypes of MRVs are circulating among pigs, and 
that the occurrence of MRVs in the farms decreased consequent to more effective 
disinfection."
394,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous group of chronic 
lung conditions. Genome-wide association studies have identified 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with COPD and the co-occurring 
conditions, suggesting common biological mechanisms underlying COPD and these 
co-occurring conditions. To identify them, we have integrated information across 
different biological levels (i.e., genetic variants, lung-specific 3D genome 
structure, gene expression and protein-protein interactions) to build 
lung-specific gene regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks. We have 
queried these networks using disease-associated SNPs for COPD, unipolar 
depression and coronary artery disease. COPD-associated SNPs can control genes 
involved in the regulation of lung or pulmonary function, asthma, brain region 
volumes, cortical surface area, depressed affect, neuroticism, Parkinson's 
disease, white matter microstructure and smoking behaviour. We describe the 
regulatory connections, genes and biochemical pathways that underlay these 
co-occurring trait-SNP-gene associations. Collectively, our findings provide new 
avenues for the investigation of the underlying biology and diverse clinical 
presentations of COPD. In so doing, we identify a collection of genetic variants 
and genes that may aid COPD patient stratification and treatment."
395,"Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit, of which genetic etiologies are 
a frequent cause. Dominant and recessive mutations in TMC1, a gene encoding the 
pore-forming subunit of the hair cell mechanotransduction channel, cause DFNA36 
and DFNB7/11, respectively, accounting for ∼2% of genetic hearing loss. Previous 
work has established the efficacy of mutation-targeted RNAi in treatment of 
murine models of autosomal dominant non-syndromic deafness. However, application 
of such approaches is limited by the infeasibility of development and validation 
of novel constructs for each variant. We developed an allele-non-specific 
approach consisting of mutation-agnostic RNAi suppression of both mutant and WT 
alleles, co-delivered with a knockdown-resistant engineered WT allele with or 
without the use of woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory 
element (WPRE) to augment transgene expression. This therapeutic construct was 
delivered into the mature murine model of DFNA36 with an AAV vector and achieved 
robust hair cell and auditory brainstem response preservation. However, 
WPRE-enhanced Tmc1 expression resulted in inferior outcomes, suggesting a role 
for gene dosage optimization in future TMC1 gene therapy development."
396,"Poa annua L. is a globally distributed grass with economic and horticultural 
significance as a weed and as a turfgrass. This dual significance, and its 
phenotypic plasticity and ecological adaptation, has made P. annua an intriguing 
plant for genetic and evolutionary studies. Because of the lack of genomic 
resources and its allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 28) nature, a reference genome 
sequence would be a valuable asset to better understand the significance and 
polyploid origin of Poa annua. Here we report a genome assembly with scaffolds 
representing the 14 haploid chromosomes that are 1.78 Gb in length with an N50 
of 112 Mb and 96.7% of BUSCO orthologs. Seventy percent of the genome was 
identified as repetitive elements, 91.0% of which were Copia- or Gypsy-like 
long-terminal repeats. The genome was annotated with 76,420 genes spanning 13.3% 
of the 14 chromosomes. The two subgenomes originating from Poa infirma (Knuth) 
and Poa supina (Schrad) were sufficiently divergent to be distinguishable, but 
syntenic in sequence and annotation with repetitive elements contributing to the 
expansion of the P. infirma subgenome."
397,"Herewith, we provide novel original data about the prevalence of FCN3 
rs532781899 and MASP2 rs72550870 variants among the newborns of aboriginal 
Siberian Arctic populations (Nenets and Dolgan-Nganasans) and Russians of East 
Siberia. This novel data has been analyzed along with the genetic data about 
other proteins of the lectin pathway of the complement system (mannose-binding 
lectin and ficolin-2) obtained earlier.
METHODS: A total of 926 specimens of dried blood spots of the newborns were 
genotyped. The newborns represented four populations: Nenets, Dolgan-Nganasans, 
Mixed aboriginal population, and Russians (Caucasians) to study the prevalence 
of single nucleotide polymorphisms of FCN3 rs532781899 and MASP2 rs72550870.
RESULTS: The prevalence of the deletion allele of the rs532781899 variant in the 
FCN3 gene associated with the decreased production of ficoline-3 was found to be 
increased in Russians compared to the Nenets aboriginal populations (p = 0.002). 
The prevalence of the rs72550870*G allele in the MASP2 gene associated with low 
serum protease activity was found to be increased in Russians compared with 
Nenets and Dolgan-Nganasans (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The results of the current study and our previous findings 
corroborate with a hypothesis that human evolution has been directed toward the 
accumulation of genotypes associated with low activity of the lectin complement 
activation pathway."
398,"Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) is rising rapidly in many 
industrialised and affluent areas in the Asia Pacific region. Current available 
guidelines, mainly from Europe and North America, may not be completely 
applicable to clinicians caring for children with PIBD in this region due to 
differences in disease characteristics and regional resources constraints. This 
position paper is an initiative from the Asian Pan-Pacific Society for Pediatric 
Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (APPSPGHAN) with the aim of providing 
an up-to-date, evidence-based approach to PIBD in the Asia Pacific region, 
taking into consideration the unique disease characteristics and financial 
resources available in this region. A group of pediatric gastroenterologists 
with special interest in PIBD performed an extensive literature search covering 
epidemiology, disease characteristics and natural history, management and 
monitoring. Gastrointestinal infections, including tuberculosis, need to be 
excluded before diagnosing IBD. In some populations in Asia, the Nudix Hydrolase 
15 (NUD15) gene is a better predictor of leukopenia induced by azathioprine than 
thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT). The main considerations in the use of 
biologics in the Asia Pacific region are high cost, ease of access, and 
potential infectious risk, especially tuberculosis. Conclusion: This position 
paper provides a useful guide to clinicians in the medical management of 
children with PIBD in the Asia Pacific region."
399,"The changes in gut microbiota have been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC). 
The interplays between the host and gut microbiota remain largely unclear, and 
few studies have investigated these interplays using integrative multi-omics 
data. In this study, large-scale multi-comic datasets, including microbiome, 
metabolome, bulk transcriptomics and single cell RNA sequencing of CRC patients, 
were analyzed individually and integrated through advanced bioinformatics 
methods. We further examined the clinical relevance of these findings in the 
mice recolonized with microbiota from human. We found that CRC patients had 
distinct microbiota compositions compared to healthy controls. A 
machine-learning model was developed with 28 biomarkers for detection of CRC, 
which had high accuracy and clinical applicability. We identified multiple 
significant correlations between genera and well-characterized genes, suggesting 
the potential role of gut microbiota in tumor immunity. Further analysis showed 
that specific metabolites worked as profound communicators between these genera 
and tumor immunity. Integrating microbiota and metabolome perspectives, we 
catalogued gut taxonomic and metabolomic features that represented the key 
multi-omics signature of CRC. Furthermore, gut microbiota from CRC patients 
transplanted to compromise the response of CRC to immunotherapy. These 
phenotypes were strongly associated with the alterations in gut microbiota, 
immune cell infiltration as well as multiple metabolic pathways. The 
comprehensive interplays across multi-comic data of CRC might explain how gut 
microbiota influenced tumor immunity. Hence, we proposed that modifying the CRC 
microbiota using healthy donors might serve as a promising strategy to improve 
response to immunotherapy."
400,"Recently, Vibrio anguillarum, a Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium, has been 
becoming a major constraint on the development of the turbot aquaculture 
industry because of its characteristics of worldwide distribution, broad host 
range and potentially devastating impacts. Although the function of 
protein-coding mRNAs in the immune response against bacterial infection has been 
reported, as well as several non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), the relationships between mRNAs and ncRNAs in 
the immune system of turbot liver are still limited during bacterial infection. 
In the present study, the comprehensive analyses of whole-transcriptome 
sequencing were conducted in turbot liver infected by V. anguillarum. The 
differential expression was analyzed in the data of circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. 
The interactions of miRNA-circRNA pairs and miRNA-mRNA pairs were predicted 
basing on the negative regulatory relationships between miRNAs and their target 
circRNAs\mRNAs. The circRNA-related ceRNA regulatory networks were constructed 
for the analyses of regulated mechanism in turbot immune system. Subsequently, 
the RT-qPCR was carried out to verify the results of sequencing. Therefore, we 
identified 31 circRNAs, 53 miRNAs and 948 mRNAs with differential expression. 
Gene set enrichment analyses using Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of 
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways showed that innate immunity was principally 
activated at the early stages of infection, while adaptive immunity was 
activated after 24 hrs. Finally, 65 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA pathways were 
constructed, based on the hypothesis of ceRNA regulatory networks. In 
conclusion, our findings provide new insights on the underlying immune response 
to bacterial infection and identify novel target genes for the prevention and 
control of disease in turbot."
401,"TCF4 gene encodes a class I helix-loop-helix transcription factor critical for 
the developing brain. Common polymorphisms in TCF4 and disruptive variants in 
the proximal region of the gene have been linked to relatively mild 
neuropsychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders. In contrast, variants 
impacting distal exons are associated with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS), a 
severe autosomal dominant condition characterized by profound intellectual 
disability, developmental delay, limited or absent speech, distinctive facies, 
and disordered breathing. Although phenotypic variability has been observed in 
PTHS, intellectual impairment and significant speech and motor delays are 
invariably present. In contrast to the typical de novo variants causing 
TCF4-related disorder and PTHS, we report a familial form of TCF4-related 
disorder where the missense variant arose de novo in the father and was 
inherited by two of his children. Although this family's variant's position in 
exon 18 predicted a typical PTHS phenotype, none of the affected individuals met 
the clinical diagnostic criteria for PTHS suggested by Zollino et al. in the 
first international consensus statement (as in the study by Zollino et al. in 
2019). Rather, the three affected family members exhibited remarkably variable 
and milder phenotypes than would have been predicted from the position of their 
TCF4 variant. Thus, the clinical spectrum of PTHS-associated TCF4 variants may 
be broader than previously reported."
402,"The ability of bacterial pathogens to adapt to host niches is driven by the 
carriage and regulation of genes that benefit pathogenic lifestyles. Genes that 
encode virulence or fitness-enhancing factors must be regulated in response to 
changing host environments to allow rapid response to challenges presented by 
the host. Furthermore, this process can be controlled by preexisting 
transcription factors (TFs) that acquire new roles in tailoring regulatory 
networks, specifically in pathogens. However, the mechanisms underlying this 
process are poorly understood. The highly conserved Escherichia coli TF YhaJ 
exhibits distinct genome-binding dynamics and transcriptome control in 
pathotypes that occupy different host niches, such as uropathogenic E. coli 
(UPEC). Here, we report that this important regulator is required for UPEC 
systemic survival during murine bloodstream infection (BSI). This advantage is 
gained through the coordinated regulation of a small regulon comprised of both 
virulence and metabolic genes. YhaJ coordinates activation of both Type 1 and 
F1C fimbriae, as well as biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan, by both 
direct and indirect mechanisms. Deletion of yhaJ or the individual genes under 
its control leads to attenuated survival during BSI. Furthermore, all three 
systems are up-regulated in response to signals derived from serum or systemic 
host tissue, but not urine, suggesting a niche-specific regulatory trigger that 
enhances UPEC fitness via pleiotropic mechanisms. Collectively, our results 
identify YhaJ as a pathotype-specific regulatory aide, enhancing the expression 
of key genes that are collectively required for UPEC bloodstream pathogenesis."
403,"In Lepidoptera and Diptera, the fat body dissociates into single cells in 
nondiapause pupae, but it does not dissociate in diapause pupae until diapause 
termination. Using the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, as a model of 
pupal diapause insects, we illustrated the catalytic mechanism and physiological 
importance of fat body cell dissociation in regulating pupal development and 
diapause. In nondiapause pupae, cathepsin L (CatL) activates matrix 
metalloproteinases (Mmps) that degrade extracellular matrix proteins and cause 
fat body cell dissociation. Mmp-induced fat body cell dissociation activates 
lipid metabolism through transcriptional regulation, and the resulting energetic 
supplies increase brain metabolic activity (i.e., mitochondria respiration and 
insulin signaling) and thus promote pupal development. In diapause pupae, low 
activities of CatL and Mmps prevent fat body cell dissociation and lipid 
metabolism from occurring, maintaining pupal diapause. Importantly, as 
demonstrated by chemical inhibitor treatments and CRISPR-mediated gene 
knockouts, Mmp inhibition delayed pupal development and moderately increased the 
incidence of pupal diapause, while Mmp stimulation promoted pupal development 
and moderately averted pupal diapause. This study advances our recent 
understanding of fat body biology and insect diapause regulation."
404,"The cnidarian Nematostella vectensis has developed into a powerful model system 
to study the mechanisms underlying animal development, regeneration, and 
evolution. However, despite the significant progress in the molecular and 
genetic approaches in this sea anemone, endogenous protein tagging is still 
challenging. Here, we report a robust method for knock in for Nematostella using 
CRISPR/Cas9. As an outcome, we generate endogenously tagged proteins that label 
core molecular components of several cellular apparatus, including the nuclear 
envelope, cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, endoplasmic reticulum, cell trafficking, 
and extracellular matrix. Using live imaging, we monitor the dynamics of 
vesicular trafficking and endoplasmic reticulum in embryos, as well as cell 
contractility during the peristaltic wave of a primary polyp. This advancement 
in gene editing expands the molecular tool kit of Nematostella and enables 
experimental avenues to interrogate the cell biology of cnidarians."
405,"Microbes naturally coexist in complex, multistrain communities. However, 
extracting individual microbes from and specifically manipulating the 
composition of these consortia remain challenging. The sequence-specific nature 
of CRISPR guide RNAs can be leveraged to accurately differentiate microorganisms 
and facilitate the creation of tools that can achieve these tasks. We developed 
a computational program, ssCRISPR, which designs strain-specific CRISPR guide 
RNA sequences with user-specified target strains, protected strains, and guide 
RNA properties. We experimentally verify the accuracy of the strain specificity 
predictions in both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp. and show that up to 
three nucleotide mismatches are often required to ensure perfect specificity. To 
demonstrate the functionality of ssCRISPR, we apply computationally designed 
CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs to two applications: the purification of specific 
microbes through one- and two-plasmid transformation workflows and the targeted 
removal of specific microbes using DNA-loaded liposomes. For strain 
purification, we utilize gRNAs designed to target and kill all microbes in a 
consortium except the specific microbe to be isolated. For strain elimination, 
we utilize gRNAs designed to target only the unwanted microbe while protecting 
all other strains in the community. ssCRISPR will be of use in diverse 
microbiota engineering applications."
406,"WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) is a core scaffolding component of many multiprotein 
complexes that perform a variety of critical chromatin-centric processes in the 
nucleus. WDR5 is a component of the mixed lineage leukemia MLL/SET complex and 
localizes MYC to chromatin at tumor-critical target genes. As a part of these 
complexes, WDR5 plays a role in sustaining oncogenesis in a variety of human 
cancers that are often associated with poor prognoses. Thus, WDR5 has been 
recognized as an attractive therapeutic target for treating both solid and 
hematological tumors. Previously, small-molecule inhibitors of the 
WDR5-interaction (WIN) site and WDR5 degraders have demonstrated robust in vitro 
cellular efficacy in cancer cell lines and established the therapeutic potential 
of WDR5. However, these agents have not demonstrated significant in vivo 
efficacy at pharmacologically relevant doses by oral administration in animal 
disease models. We have discovered WDR5 WIN-site inhibitors that feature 
bicyclic heteroaryl P7 units through structure-based design and address the 
limitations of our previous series of small-molecule inhibitors. Importantly, 
our lead compounds exhibit enhanced on-target potency, excellent oral 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, and potent dose-dependent in vivo efficacy in a 
mouse MV4:11 subcutaneous xenograft model by oral dosing. Furthermore, these 
in vivo probes show excellent tolerability under a repeated high-dose regimen in 
rodents to demonstrate the safety of the WDR5 WIN-site inhibition mechanism. 
Collectively, our results provide strong support for WDR5 WIN-site inhibitors to 
be utilized as potential anticancer therapeutics."
407,"A growing body of work has addressed human adaptations to diverse environments 
using genomic data, but few studies have connected putatively selected alleles 
to phenotypes, much less among underrepresented populations such as Amerindians. 
Studies of natural selection and genotype-phenotype relationships in 
underrepresented populations hold potential to uncover previously undescribed 
loci underlying evolutionarily and biomedically relevant traits. Here, we worked 
with the Tsimane and the Moseten, two Amerindian populations inhabiting the 
Bolivian lowlands. We focused most intensively on the Tsimane, because long-term 
anthropological work with this group has shown that they have a high burden of 
both macro and microparasites, as well as minimal cardiometabolic disease or 
dementia. We therefore generated genome-wide genotype data for Tsimane 
individuals to study natural selection, and paired this with blood mRNA-seq as 
well as cardiometabolic and immune biomarker data generated from a larger sample 
that included both populations. In the Tsimane, we identified 21 regions that 
are candidates for selective sweeps, as well as 5 immune traits that show 
evidence for polygenic selection (e.g., C-reactive protein levels and the 
response to coronaviruses). Genes overlapping candidate regions were strongly 
enriched for known involvement in immune-related traits, such as abundance of 
lymphocytes and eosinophils. Importantly, we were also able to draw on extensive 
phenotype information for the Tsimane and Moseten and link five regions 
(containing PSD4, MUC21 and MUC22, TOX2, ANXA6, and ABCA1) with biomarkers of 
immune and metabolic function. Together, our work highlights the utility of 
pairing evolutionary analyses with anthropological and biomedical data to gain 
insight into the genetic basis of health-related traits."
408,"The pathological accumulation of the microtubule binding protein tau drives 
age-related neurodegeneration in a variety of disorders, collectively called 
tauopathies. In the most common tauopathy, Alzheimer's disease (AD), the 
accumulation of pathological tau strongly correlates with cognitive decline. The 
underlying molecular mechanisms that drive neurodegeneration in tauopathies 
remain incompletely understood and no effective disease modifying 
pharmacological interventions currently exist. Here, we show that tau toxicity 
depends on the highly conserved nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein SPOP 
in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of tauopathy. Loss of function mutations in 
the C. elegans spop-1 gene significantly improves behavioral deficits in tau 
transgenic animals, while neuronal overexpression of SPOP-1 protein 
significantly worsens behavioral deficits. In addition, loss of spop-1 rescues a 
variety of tau-related phenotypes including the accumulation of total and 
phosphorylated tau protein, neurodegeneration, and shortened lifespan. Knockdown 
of SPOP-1's E3 ubiquitin ligase cul-3/Cullin3 does not improve tauopathy 
suggesting a non-degradative mechanism of action for SPOP-1. Suppression of 
disease-related phenotypes occurs independently of the nuclear speckle resident 
poly(A)-binding protein SUT-2/MSUT2. MSUT2 modifies tauopathy in mammalian 
neurons and in AD. Our work identifies SPOP as a novel modifier of tauopathy and 
a conceptual pathway for therapeutic intervention."
409,"Breast cancer (BC) is a complex disease comprising multiple distinct subtypes 
with different genetic features and pathological characteristics. Although a 
large number of antineoplastic compounds have been approved for clinical use, 
patient-to-patient variability in drug response is frequently observed, 
highlighting the need for efficient treatment prediction for individualized 
therapy. Several patient-derived models have been established lately for the 
prediction of drug response. However, each of these models has its limitations 
that impede their clinical application. Here, we report that the whole-tumor 
cell culture (WTC) ex vivo model could be stably established from all breast 
tumors with a high success rate (98 out of 116), and it could reassemble the 
parental tumors with the endogenous microenvironment. We observed strong 
clinical associations and predictive values from the investigation of a broad 
range of BC therapies with WTCs derived from a patient cohort. The accuracy was 
further supported by the correlation between WTC-based test results and 
patients' clinical responses in a separate validation study, where the 
neoadjuvant treatment regimens of 15 BC patients were mimicked. Collectively, 
the WTC model allows us to accomplish personalized drug testing within 10 d, 
even for small-sized tumors, highlighting its potential for individualized BC 
therapy. Furthermore, coupled with genomic and transcriptomic analyses, 
WTC-based testing can also help to stratify specific patient groups for 
assignment into appropriate clinical trials, as well as validate potential 
biomarkers during drug development."
410,"Unraveling cell-cell interaction is fundamental to understanding many biological 
processes. To date, genetic tools for labeling neighboring cells in mammals are 
not available. Here, we developed a labeling strategy based on the Cre-induced 
intercellular labeling protein (CILP). Cre-expressing donor cells release a 
lipid-soluble and membrane-permeable fluorescent protein that is then taken up 
by recipient cells, enabling fluorescent labeling of neighboring cells. Using 
CILP, we specifically labeled endothelial cells surrounding a special population 
of hepatocytes in adult mice and revealed their distinct gene signatures. Our 
results highlight the potential of CILP as a platform to reveal cell-cell 
interactions and communications in vivo."
411,"Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, which are dimers of 
a glycosylated polymorphic transmembrane heavy chain and the small-protein 
β2-microglobulin (β2m), bind peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum that are 
generated by the cytosolic turnover of cellular proteins. In virus-infected 
cells, these peptides may include those derived from viral proteins. 
Peptide-MHC-I complexes then traffic through the secretory pathway and are 
displayed at the cell surface where those containing viral peptides can be 
detected by CD8+ T lymphocytes that kill infected cells. Many viruses enhance 
their in vivo survival by encoding genes that down-regulate MHC-I expression to 
avoid CD8+ T cell recognition. Here, we report that two accessory proteins 
encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 
down-regulate MHC-I expression using distinct mechanisms. First, ORF3a, a 
viroporin, reduces the global trafficking of proteins, including MHC-I, through 
the secretory pathway. The second, ORF7a, interacts specifically with the MHC-I 
heavy chain, acting as a molecular mimic of β2m to inhibit its association. This 
slows the exit of properly assembled MHC-I molecules from the endoplasmic 
reticulum. We demonstrate that ORF7a reduces antigen presentation by the human 
MHC-I allele HLA-A*02:01. Thus, both ORF3a and ORF7a act post-translationally in 
the secretory pathway to lower surface MHC-I expression, with ORF7a exhibiting a 
specific mechanism that allows immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2."
412,"Characterizing neuropsychiatric disorders is challenging due to heterogeneity in 
the population. We propose combining structural and functional neuroimaging and 
genomic data in a multimodal classification framework to leverage their 
complementary information. Our objectives are two-fold (i) to improve the 
classification of disorders and (ii) to introspect the concepts learned to 
explore underlying neural and biological mechanisms linked to mental disorders. 
Previous multimodal studies have focused on naïve neural networks, mostly 
perceptron, to learn modality-wise features and often assume equal contribution 
from each modality. Our focus is on the development of neural networks for 
feature learning and implementing an adaptive control unit for the fusion phase. 
Our mid fusion with attention model includes a multilayer feed-forward network, 
an autoencoder, a bi-directional long short-term memory unit with attention as 
the features extractor, and a linear attention module for controlling 
modality-specific influence. The proposed model acquired 92% (p < .0001) 
accuracy in schizophrenia prediction, outperforming several other 
state-of-the-art models applied to unimodal or multimodal data. Post hoc feature 
analyses uncovered critical neural features and genes/biological pathways 
associated with schizophrenia. The proposed model effectively combines 
multimodal neuroimaging and genomics data for predicting mental disorders. 
Interpreting salient features identified by the model may advance our 
understanding of their underlying etiological mechanisms."
413,"With the determination of the Leloir pathway in a solventogenic wild-type strain 
WK through the transcriptional analysis, two pivotal genes (galK and galT) were 
systematically co-expressed to demonstrate a significantly enhanced galactose 
utilization for butanol production with the elimination of carbon catabolite 
repression (CCR). The gene-modified strain WK-Gal-4 could effectively co-utilize 
galactose and glucose by directly using an ultrasonication-assisted butyric 
acid-pretreated Gelidium amansii hydrolysate (BAU) as the substrate, exhibiting 
the optimal sugar consumption and butanol production from BAU of 20.31 g/L and 
7.8 g/L with an increment by 62.35 % and 61.49 % over that by strain WK, 
respectively. This work for the first time develops a feasible approach to 
utilizing red algal biomass for butanol fermentation through exploring the 
metabolic regulation of carbohydrate catabolism, also offering a novel route to 
develop the future biorefinery using the cost-effective and sustainable marine 
feedstocks."
414,"The early sign detection of liver lesions plays an extremely important role in 
preventing, diagnosing, and treating liver diseases. In fact, radiologists 
mainly consider Hounsfield Units to locate liver lesions. However, most studies 
focus on the analysis of unenhanced computed tomography images without 
considering an attenuation difference between Hounsfield Units before and after 
contrast injection. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to develop an 
improved method for the automatic detection and classification of common liver 
lesions based on deep learning techniques and the variations of the Hounsfield 
Units density on computed tomography scans. We design and implement a 
multi-phase classification model developed on the Faster Region-based 
Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional 
Networks (R-FCN), and Single Shot Detector Networks (SSD) with the transfer 
learning approach. The model considers the variations of the Hounsfield Unit 
density on computed tomography scans in four phases before and after contrast 
injection (plain, arterial, venous, and delay). The experiments are conducted on 
three common types of liver lesions including liver cysts, hemangiomas, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Experimental results show that the proposed method 
accurately locates and classifies common liver lesions. The liver lesions 
detection with Hounsfield Units gives high accuracy of 100%. Meanwhile, the 
lesion classification achieves an accuracy of 95.1%. The promising results show 
the applicability of the proposed method for automatic liver lesions detection 
and classification. The proposed method improves the accuracy of liver lesions 
detection and classification compared with some preceding methods. It is useful 
for practical systems to assist doctors in the diagnosis of liver lesions. In 
our further research, an improvement can be made with big data analysis to build 
real-time processing systems and we expand this study to detect lesions from all 
parts of the human body, not just the liver."
415,"Antioxidant natural products and their analogs especially phenolic compounds, 
exhibit diverse biological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
and anticancer activities. Ginger which is widely used worldwide for various 
beneficial effects also contains several phenolic antioxidants, and 6-gingerol 
is one of the natural products studied extensively. However, the molecular 
mechanism of synthetically synthesized 6-gingerdione (compound 1) from 
6-gingerol was not known. In this study, compound 1 and methylated 6-gingerdione 
(compound 2) were obtained semi synthetically from 6-gingerol. Compound 1 and 2 
are subjected to SwissADME prediction. Then the protective effect of compound 1 
was analyzed in 2 % EtOH induced HepG2 cells and zebrafish larvae. Hydroxyl and 
nitric oxide scavenging assays reveal that compound 1 showed more antioxidant 
activity than compound 2 at 50 μM. Moreover, compound 1 exhibited good 
anti-inflammatory activity via lipoxygenase inhibition and proteinase 
inhibition. Apoptosis and oxidative stress in HepG2 cells were induced by 2 % 
EtOH and treated with compound 1. Compound 1 significantly inhibited the EtOH 
induced nitric oxide production, apoptosis, and ROS generation in HepG2 cells. 
Encouraged by the in-vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, 
compound 1 was then investigated for its protective effect in 2 % EtOH induced 
ALD zebrafish larva. Compound 1 protected the zebrafish larvae from liver injury 
by suppressing inflammatory (COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-1β) and lipogenic genes 
(C/EBP-α, SREBP1, and IL-1β) while upregulating the antioxidant gene. Our 
findings indicate that compound 1 synthesized from 6-gingerol ameliorated liver 
injury that likely, contributes to its potential antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory properties."
416,"Proteases are an important class of drug targets that continue to drive 
inhibitor discovery. These enzymes are prone to resistance mutations, yet their 
promise for treating viral diseases and other disorders continues to grow. This 
study develops a general approach for detecting microbially synthesized protease 
inhibitors and uses it to screen terpenoid pathways for inhibitory compounds. 
The detection scheme relies on a bacterial two-hybrid (B2H) system that links 
protease inactivation to the transcription of a swappable reporter gene. This 
system, which can accomodate multiple biochemical outputs (i.e., luminescence 
and antibiotic resistance), permitted the facile incorporation of four 
disease-relevant proteases. A B2H designed to detect the inactivation of the 
main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 enabled the 
identification of a terpenoid inhibitor of modest potency. An analysis of 
multiple pathways that make this terpenoid, however, suggested that its 
production was necessary but not sufficient to confer a survival advantage in 
growth-coupled assays. This finding highlights an important challenge associated 
with the use of genetic selection to search for inhibitors─notably, the 
influence of pathway toxicity─and underlines the value of including multiple 
pathways with overlapping product profiles in pathway screens. This study 
provides a detailed experimental framework for using microbes to screen 
libraries of biosynthetic pathways for targeted protease inhibitors."
417,"CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells have demonstrated efficacy in graft-versus-host 
disease (GvHD) prevention and treatment. Preclinical and clinical studies 
indicate that Treg are able to protect from GvHD without interfering with the 
graft-versus-tumor (GvT) effect of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), 
although the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. To elucidate 
Treg suppressive function during in vivo suppression of acute GvHD, we performed 
paired T cell receptor (TCRa, TCRb genes) repertoire sequencing and RNA 
sequencing analysis on conventional T cells (Tcon) and Treg before and after 
transplantation in an MHC major-mismatch mouse model of HCT. We show that both 
Treg and Tcon underwent clonal restriction and that Treg did not interfere with 
the activation of alloreactive Tcon clones and the breadth of their TCR 
repertoire, however, markedly suppressed their expansion. Transcriptomic 
analysis revealed that Treg predominantly affected the transcriptome of CD4 Tcon 
and to a lesser extent of CD8 Tcon, modulating the transcription of genes 
encoding pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules as well as enzymes involved in 
metabolic processes, inducing a switch from glycolysis to oxidative 
phosphorylation. Finally, Treg did not interfere with the induction of gene sets 
involved in the GvT effect. Our results shed light into the mechanisms of acute 
GvHD suppression by Treg and will support the clinical translation of this 
immunoregulatory approach."
418,"Soybean is a major source of high-quality protein for humans and animals. The 
content of sulfur-containing amino acids (SAA) in soybean is insufficient, which 
has become the main factor limiting soybean nutrition. In this study, we used 
the high-density genetic maps derived from Guizao 1 and Brazil 13 to evaluate 
the quantitative trait loci of cysteine (Cys), methionine (Met), SAA, glycinin 
(7S), β-conglycinin (11S), ratio of glycinin to β-conglycinin (RGC), and protein 
content (PC). In genetic map linkage analysis, the major and stable 44 QTLs were 
detected, which shared nine bin intervals. Among them, the bin interval 
(bin157-bin160) on chromosome 5 was detected in multiple environments as a 
stable QTL, which was linked to 11S, 7S, RGC, and SSA. Based on the analysis of 
bioinformatics and RNA-sequencing data, 16 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
within these QTLs were selected as candidate genes. These results will help to 
elucidate the genetic mechanism of soybean SAA-related traits and provide the 
basis for the gene mining of sulfur-containing amino acids."
419,"BACKGROUND: Serrate d polyps (SP) is associated with an increased risk of 
colorectal cancer. Patients with SP history tend to have SP recurrence. However, 
the risk factors for metachronous polyps (MP) in those patients are not well 
established.
METHODS: Data of colonoscopy were retrospectively reviewed from October 2012 to 
October 2021. The pathology database, electronic medical records and telephone 
follow-up data were also observed.
RESULTS: A total of 906 patients were studied including 278 patients with MPs 
and 628 patients without. The multiplicity of polyps (OR, 13.63; 95% CI, 
8.80-21.75), older age (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 1.87-20.63), abdominal obesity (OR, 
2.46; 95% CI, 0.98-6.42), current smoker (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.15-7.83) and 
sedentary lifestyle (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.22-1.65) are significantly associated 
with the risk of MPs. Patients with baseline SP < 10 mm were more likely to 
develop higher or same risk-grade polyps (HSRGP) ( P  = 0.0014). Patients with 
non-clinically significant SPs whether coexisted with adenoma or not were more 
likely to develop HSRGPs when compared to others ( P  < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Total number of polyps, older age, sedentary behavior, abdominal 
obesity and smoking status contributed to the risk of MPs at surveillance 
colonoscopy. Patients with grade 1 SPs might require closer surveillance. SPs 
coexisting with conventional adenoma did not increase the risk of MPs but may 
increase the risk of developing HSRGPs."
420,"OBJECTIVE: Neurodegeneration induced by inflammatory stress in multiple 
sclerosis (MS) leads to long-term neurological disabilities that are not 
amenable to current immunomodulatory therapies.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we report that neuronal downregulation of Splicing 
factor 3b subunit 2 (SF3B2), a component of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 
(snRNP), preserves retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival and axonal integrity in 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)-induced mice. By employing an 
in vitro system recapitulating the inflammatory environment of MS lesion, we 
show that when SF3B2 levels are downregulated, cell viability and axon integrity 
are preserved in cortical neurons against inflammatory toxicity. Notably, 
knockdown of SF3B2 suppresses the expression of injury-response and necroptosis 
genes and prevents activation of Sterile Alpha and TIR Motif Containing 1 
(Sarm1), a key enzyme that mediates programmed axon degeneration.
INTERPRETATION: Together, these findings suggest that the downregulation of 
SF3B2 is a novel potential therapeutic target to prevent secondary 
neurodegeneration in MS."
421,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a rare myeloproliferative disease in children. 
The primary cause of CML is the chimeric BCR::ABL1 gene in hematopoietic stem 
cells, which leads to leukocytosis, platelet proliferation, and splenomegaly. 
Lately, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have replaced hematopoietic cell 
transplantation, which was previously considered the only curative therapy, as 
the first-line treatment for chronic-phase CML. However, the clinical efficacy 
of TKIs, including those effective in adult CML, has not been well-investigated 
in pediatric CML. This review describes the recommended TKI-based management 
strategies for pediatric CML according to the literature and guidelines. 
Furthermore, we discuss the prospects for TKI discontinuation to avoid important 
adverse events, such as growth impairment, in children."
422,"Environmental pollution by heavy metals is becoming an increasing problem and 
has become a matter of great concern due to the adverse effects worldwide. In 
this study, we report a novel strain of multi-metal resistant bacteria. A 
Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile, yellow, rod-shaped strain 
17AT, was isolated from the shallow silt of Fuyang River located in Longdian 
town, Hengshui city, Hebei province, China. Strain 17AT grew at 20-35 °C 
(optimum, 30 °C), pH 5-10 (optimum, pH 7) and 0-2% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 1%). 
Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain 17AT was 
closely related to members of the genus Flavobacterium, and had the highest 16S 
rRNA gene sequence similarity with 'Flavobacterium panacis' DCY106T (97.5%), 
followed by Flavobacterium johnsoniae subsp. johnsoniae UW101T (97.3%), 
Flavobacterium cutihirudinis E89T (97.2%), Flavobacterium limi THG-AG6.4T 
(97.2%), Flavobacterium hibisci THG-HG1.4T (97.2%) and Flavobacterium johnsoniae 
subsp. aurantiacum DSM 6792T (97.1%). The genome size of strain 17AT was 5.4 Mb 
and the DNA G + C content was 34.0%. The average nucleotide identity, digital 
DNA-DNA hybridization and average amino acid identity values among strain 17AT 
and reference strains were in the ranges of 79.8-86.1%, 24.1-31.4% and 
80.5-88.6%, respectively, lower than the threshold values for species 
delineation. Strain 17AT contained iso-C15:0 and C16:0 3-OH as the predominant 
fatty acids (≥ 10%). The main isoprenoid quinone of strain 17AT was identified 
as MK-6. The polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, three 
unidentified aminolipids, two unidentified aminophospholipids and six 
unidentified lipids. Comparative genomics analysis between strain 17AT and its 
reference type strains revealed that there are a number of metal-resistant genes 
in strain 17AT, which are located in 15 gene clusters responsible for the copper 
homeostasis, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance, copper resistance, and 
arsenic/antimony resistance, with the copper resistance protein NlpE being 
unique to 17AT. Combined data from phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic 
studies demonstrated that strain 17AT is a representative of a novel species 
within the genus Flavobacterium, for which the name Flavobacterium potami sp. 
nov. is proposed. The type strain is 17AT (= GDMCC 1.2723T = JCM 34833T)."
423,"INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a heterogeneous malignancy with 
dismal prognosis. However, few studies have conducted on the metabolic 
heterogeneity in SCLC.
OBJECTIVE: We therefore identify SCLC classifications using untargeted 
metabolomics and lipidomics. We also compared their survival and the 
immunotherapy responses.
METHODS: Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
analysis was performed in 191 SCLC serum samples. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) analysis was conducted to identify metabolic pathways. The 
Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test were used to analyze the survival curves. The 
univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used 
to evaluate prognostic factors for OS in patients with SCLC.
RESULTS: Distinct subtypes of SCLC were identified by consensus clustering 
algorithm using partioning around medoids (pam) based on untargeted metabolomics 
and lipidomics. Four distinct subtypes of SCLC were identified, with distinct 
metabolic pathways. Subgroup 2 had the longest survival whereas Subgroup 1 had 
the shortest. Subtype 2 benefited most from immunotherapy in OS, as in contrast 
to Subtype 3 with shortest survival.
CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the metabolic heterogeneity in SCLC and 
identified four subtypes with distinct metabolic features. It indicates 
promising therapeutic and prognostic value that may guide treatment for SCLC. 
The subtype-specific clinical trials may be designed and would be instructive 
for drug development."
424,"In early brain injury (EBI), oxidative stress occurs following subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (SAH), and mitochondria are intricately linked to this process. SS31, 
a mitochondria-targeting antioxidative peptide, has been demonstrated to be 
beneficial for multiple diseases because of its powerful antioxidant and 
neuroprotective properties. Although our previous study revealed that SS31 was 
involved in the powerful antioxidant effect following SAH, the underlying 
molecular mechanisms remained unclear. Thus, our study aimed to investigate the 
neuroprotective effects of SS31 by reversing mitochondrial dysfunction in EBI 
following SAH, via activating the Nrf2 signaling and PGC-1α pathways. Our 
findings confirmed that SS31 ameliorated SAH-triggered oxidative insult. SS31 
administration decreased redundant reactive oxygen species, alleviated lipid 
peroxidation, and elevated the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Concomitant 
with the inhibited oxidative insult, SS31 dramatically attenuated neurological 
deficits, cerebral edema, neural apoptosis, and blood-brain barrier disruption 
following SAH. Moreover, SS31 remarkably promoted nuclear factor-erythroid 2 
related factor 2 (Nrf2) nuclear shuttle and upregulated the expression levels of 
heme oxygenase-1 and NADPH: quinine oxidoreductase1. Additionally, SS31 enhanced 
the expression levels of PGC-1α and its target genes, and increased the mtDNA 
copy number, promoting mitochondrial function. However, PGC-1α-specific 
inhibitor SR-18292 pretreatment dramatically suppressed SS31-induced Nrf2 
expression and PGC-1α activation. Furthermore, pretreatment with SR-18292 
reversed the neuroprotective and antioxidant roles of SS31. These significant 
beneficial effects were associated with the activation of the Nrf2 signaling and 
PGC-1α pathways and were antagonized by SR-18292 administration. Our findings 
reveal that SS31 exhibits its neuroprotective activity by reversing 
mitochondrial dysfunction via activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which could 
be mediated through PGC-1α activation."
425,"The effect of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PGB02 isolated from buttermilk on 
serum cholesterol profile of normal and hypercholesterolemic mice was evaluated. 
Further changes in the expression of mice genes were determined. The 
hypercholesterolemia was induced in experimental mice by feeding high 
cholesterol and fat diet. Serum cholesterol parameters, physical parameters, 
cholic acid excretion, and cholesterol metabolism related gene expression 
analysis was carried out. L. plantarum PGB02 efficiently reduced total 
cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol and improved HDL-cholesterol in 
hypercholesterolaemic mice. Body weight was reduced and fecal cholic acid 
increased in probiotic treatment groups. Gene expression analysis revealed that 
L. plantarum PGB02 up-regulated the expression of LDL receptors, CYP7A1, ABCA1, 
ABCG5, ABCG8, and down-regulated the expression of FXR and NPC1L1 genes. 
Summarizing the mechanism, L. plantarum PGB02 improved hypercholesterolemia by 
increasing bile acid synthesis and excretion, reducing exogeneous cholesterol 
absorption from the intestine, and increased LDL clearance through upregulation 
of LDL-receptors. The present study has given insight into the mechanism of 
serum cholesterol reduction by bile salt hydrolase positive L. plantarum PGB02 
in mice. L. plantarum PGB02 reduced the serum cholesterol level through 
increased bile acid synthesis and deconjugation and reduced absorption of 
cholesterol in the intestine. Isolate PGB02 shown cholesterol removal potential 
as good as statin."
426,"Human enterokinase light chain (hEKL) cDNA sequence was designed with the help 
of codon optimization towards Escherichia coli codon preference and ribosome 
binding site design and artificially synthesized with a thioredoxin fusion tag 
at the N-terminal and a five his-tag peptide at the C-terminal. The synthetic 
hEKL gene was cloned into the pET-15 expression vector and transferred into the 
three different expression strains of E. coli BL21(DE3), NiCo21, and SHuffle T7 
Express. Different growth and induction conditions were studied using a 
statistical response surface methodology (RSM). Recombinant hEKL protein was 
expressed at high levels in soluble form with 0.71 mM IPTG after 4 h of 
induction at 25 °C. Autocatalytic process cleaved TRX tag with enterokinase 
recognition site by the impure hEKL and yielded the mature enzyme. The target 
protein was then purified to homogeneity (> 95%) by affinity chromatography. The 
activity of hEKL was comparable to the commercial enzyme. From 1 L culture, 
80 mg pure active hEKL was obtained with the specific activity of 6.25 × 102 
U/mg. Three main parameters that help us to produce the enzyme in the folded and 
active form are the type of strain, SHuffle T7 strain, TRX and histidine fusion

concentration and the decrease of induction temperature."
427,"Farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) welfare and performance can be strongly 
influenced by stress episodes caused by handling during farming practices. To 
better understand the changes occurring after an acute stress response, we 
exposed a group of Atlantic salmon parr to an acute stressor, which involved 
netting and transferring fish to several new holding tanks. We describe a 
time-course response to stress by sampling parr in groups before (T0) and 10, 
20, 30, 45, 60, 120, 240, 300, and 330 min post-stress. A subgroup of fish was 
also subjected to the same stressor for a second time to assess their capacity 
to respond to the same challenge again within a short timeframe (ReStressed). 
Fish plasma was assessed for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and 
ions levels. Mucus cortisol levels were analyzed and compared with the plasma 
cortisol levels. At 5 selected time points (T0, 60, 90, 120, 240, and 
ReStressed), we compared the head kidney transcriptome profile of 10 fish per 
time point. The considerably delayed increase of ACTH in the plasma (60 min 
post-stress), and the earlier rise of cortisol levels (10 min post-stress), 
suggests that cortisol release could be triggered by more rapidly responding 
factors, such as the sympathetic system. This hypothesis may be supported by a 
high upregulation of several genes involved in synaptic triggering, observed 
both during the first and the second stress episodes. Furthermore, while the 
transcriptome profile showed few changes at 60 min post-stress, expression of 
genes in several immune-related pathways increased markedly with each successive 
time point, demonstrating the role of the immune system in fish coping capacity. 
Although many of the genes discussed in this paper are still poorly 
characterized, this study provides new insights regarding the mechanisms 
occurring during the stress response of salmon parr and may form the basis for a 
useful guideline on timing of sampling protocols."
428,"BACKGROUND: High-risk screening for Fabry disease in dialysis patients is an 
effective means for reducing the number of undiagnosed cases. However, such 
screening has not been conducted in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Herein, we aimed to 
estimate the prevalence of Fabry disease among patients undergoing hemodialysis 
in Chiba Prefecture by high-risk screening using α-galactosidase A (αGal A) 
activity measurement, and examine the hemodialysis effect on αGal A activity.
METHODS: Patients who underwent maintenance hemodialysis at 25 facilities in 
Chiba Prefecture were recruited. The αGal A activity was measured using the 
dried blood spot (DBS) test as the first screening. If the enzyme activity was 
lower than the cut-off, the second screening was performed with the same method 
before and after dialysis.
RESULTS: Overall, 2924 patients (2036 men and 888 women) were included from 
which 94 cases (45 men and 48 women) showed decreased αGAL activity in the first 
screening and 3 (two men and one women) in the second screening. Genetic testing 
was performed in 3 patients, and the c.1078G > A mutation in GLA gene was 
detected in one male patient (0.03%). There has been a statistically significant 
decrease in αGal A activity of DBS at post-dialysis compared to that at 
pre-dialysis (20.5 ± 10.4 pmol/h/disk and 22.7 ± 11.5 pmol/h/disk, p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Fabry disease among patients undergoing 
hemodialysis in Chiba Prefecture was estimated as 0.03%. This is the first time 
that dialysis has been shown to affect the αGal A activity."
429,"Male infertility, a global public health problem, exhibits complex pathogenic 
causes and genetic factors deserve further discovery and study. We identified a 
novel homozygous missense mutation c.224A > C (p.D75A) in ACTL7A gene in two 
infertile brothers with teratozoospermia by whole-exome sequencing (WES). In 
vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) showed 
fertilization failure of the two affected couples. The three-dimensional (3D) 
models showed that a small section of α-helix transformed into random coil in 
the mutant ACTL7A protein and mutant amino acid lacked a hydrogen bond with 
Ser170 amino acid. Immunofluorescence revealed that ACTL7A protein was degraded 
in sperms of patients. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of sperms 
from the infertile patients showed that the irregular perinuclear theca (PT) and 
acrosomal ultrastructural defects. Furthermore, ACTL7A mutation caused abnormal 
localization and reduced the expression of PLCZ1 in sperms of the patients, 
which may be the key reasons for the fertilization failure after ICSI. Our 
findings expand the spectrum of ACTL7A mutations and provide novel theoretical 
basis for genetic counseling."
430,"BACKGROUND: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare autosomal recessive ciliopathy 
characterized by 6 primary features of rod-cone dystrophy, central obesity, 
polydactyly, cognitive impairment, hypogonadism and/or genitourinary 
malformations, and kidney abnormalities. At least 21 genes associated with BBS 
have been reported. To date, BBS associated with BBS12 variants has never been 
described in the Japanese population. We report a Japanese infant female with 
BBS with compound heterozygous BBS12 variants.
METHODS: In addition to the pediatric examination, fundus photography, 
full-field electroretinogram(ffERG) and whole exome sequencing (WES) were 
underwent.
RESULTS: The infant exhibited obesity, polydactyly, cognitive impairment, 
genitourinary malformations, and kidney dysfunction. At the age of 2 years, 
ffERG revealed severe reduction in both rod- and cone-mediated 
electroretinographic responses consistent with a severe form of rod-cone 
dystrophy, with minimal retinal abnormalities. WES revealed novel compound 
heterozygous BBS12 variants (c.591T > A, p.Tyr197* and c.1372dupA, 
p.Thr458Asnfs*5) in the infant. Her parents carried each of the variants, as 
confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
CONCLUSIONS: The current observations will contribute to an expanded 
understanding of genotype-phenotype associations in BBS12-associated BBS."
431,"BACKGROUND: Soil salinization is a worldwide environmental problem, especially 
in the arid and semiarid regions of northeastern China, which are heavily 
affected by soda saline-alkaline stress. At present, there is an urgent need to 
improve the soda saline-alkaline stress tolerance of rice.
RESULTS: Stress-associated proteins are involved in regulating the abiotic 
stresses in plants. There are 18 members of the rice stress-associated protein 
(OsSAP) gene family. In this study, the expression levels of OsSAP6 in leaves 
and roots were upregulated with increasing NaHCO3 stress duration. OsSAP6 was 
located in nucleus and cytoplasm. The bud length and total root length of OsSAP6 
overexpression rice were significantly longer than those of Lj11 (Oryza sativa 
longjing11) during germination stage, and the survival rates, plant height and 
malondialdehyde content at the seedling stage showed tolerance growth of 
saline-alkaline stress. The expression of OsCu/Zn-SOD, OsAPX2, and OsCAT1 in 
transgenic lines was increased significantly under SAE (soda saline-alkali soil 
eluent) stress. OsSAP6 interacts with OsPK5 according to yeast two-hybrid 
screening and luciferase complementation experiments. The expression of OsPK5 
increased under NaHCO3 and H2O2 stress, and the overexpression of OsPK5 in rice 
improved soda saline-alkaline tolerance.
CONCLUSION: Overexpression of OsSAP6 in rice significantly enhanced 
saline-alkaline tolerance compared with the wild type. It is speculated that 
OsSAP6 responds to soda salinity stress and interacts with OsPK5 to positively 
regulate soda saline-alkaline tolerance through ROS homeostasis. This study 
revealed the features of OsSAP6 involved in response to soda saline-alkaline 
stress and the interaction with OsPK5, which provided resources for breeding 
aimed at improving the soda saline-alkaline stress tolerance of rice."
432,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect worldwide and a 
main cause of perinatal and infant mortality. Our previous genome-wide 
association study identified 53 SNPs that associated with CHD in the Han Chinese 
population. Here, we performed functional screening of 27 orthologous genes in 
zebrafish using injection of antisense morpholino oligos. From this screen, 5 
genes were identified as essential for heart development, including iqgap2, 
ptprt, ptpn22, tbck and maml3. Presumptive roles of the novel CHD-related genes 
include heart chamber formation (iqgap2 and ptprt) and atrioventricular canal 
formation (ptpn22 and tbck). While deficiency of maml3 led to defective cardiac 
trabeculation and consequent heart failure in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, we 
found that maml3 mutants showed decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation which 
caused a reduction in cardiac trabeculae due to inhibition of Notch signaling. 
Together, our study identifies 5 novel CHD-related genes that are essential for 
heart development in zebrafish and first demonstrates that maml3 is required for 
Notch signaling in vivo."
433,"AIMS: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common diabetic complication. 
Aberrant mitochondrial function causes neurodegeneration under 
hyperglycemia-induced metabolic stress, which in turn results in DPN 
progression. m6A and m6A reader (YTHDC2) are closely related to diabetes and 
diabetes complications, while the role of YTHDC2 in regulating mitochondrial 
metabolism in DPN needs to be further probed.
METHODS: For HG treatment, Schwann cells (RSC96) were subjected to D-glucose for 
72 h. db/db mice were used as the diabetic mouse model. Me-RIP assay was 
performed to evaluate KDM5B m6A level. RNA degradation assay was conducted to 
examine KDM5B mRNA stability. In addition, OCR and ECAR were examined by XF96 
Analyzer. Moreover, the content of ATP and PDH activity in RSC96 cells were 
detected using kits, and the level of ROS was detected using MitoSOX staining. 
RIP, RNA pull-down and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays were carried out to 
verify the binding relationships between YTHDC2, KDM5B and SIRT3.
RESULTS: We first observed that KDM5B expression and KDM5B mRNA stabilization 
were significantly increased in DPN. The m6A reader YTHDC2 was lowly expressed 
in DPN. Meanwhile, YTHDC2 over expression decreased KDM5B mRNA stability in an 
m6A-dependent manner. Our results also revealed that YTHDC2 overexpression 
resulted in reduced ROS level and increased ATP level, PDH activity, OCR and 
ECAR in HG-treated Schwann cells, while these effects were reversed by KDM5B 
overexpression. Additionally, SIRT3 served as the target of YTHDC2/KDM5B axis in 
regulating mitochondrial metabolism in DPN.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, YTHDC2 promoted SIRT3 expression by reducing the 
stabilization of KDM5B to improve mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming in DPN."
434,"Prostate cancer, one of the major causes of mortality globally is regarded as 
the second leading cause of mortality among men. It is known to affect the 
stromal cells surrounding it. Through the use of exosomes, the affected stromal 
cells can promote the growth and spread of the cancer. Exosomes are known to 
play a role not only in the development and progression of cancer but also 
contribute to the drug-resistance character of cancer cells. Recently, the 
discovery of the small non-coding RNAs or miRNA has attracted attention of 
cancer researchers as they can regulate the expression of different genes. 
Therefore, exosomal miRNA can be used as a novel and reliable biomarker for the 
diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. In addition, exosomal miRNAs can 
also be used as a potential treatment for prostate cancer. The goal of this 
review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current knowledge about the 
role of exosomal miRNAs in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer and 
their potential role in monitoring the disease."
435,"PURPOSE: Existing biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting metastasis of lung 
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) may not meet the demands of clinical practice. Risk 
prediction models with multiple markers may provide better prognostic factors 
for accurate diagnosis and prediction of metastatic LUAD.
METHODS: An animal model of LUAD metastasis was constructed using CRISPR 
technology, and genes related to LUAD metastasis were screened by mRNA 
sequencing of normal and metastatic tissues. The immune characteristics of 
different subtypes were analyzed, and differentially expressed genes were 
subjected to survival and Cox regression analyses to identify the specific genes 
involved in metastasis for constructing a prediction model. The biological 
function of RFLNA was verified by analyzing CCK-8, migration, invasion, and 
apoptosis in LUAD cell lines.
RESULTS: We identified 108 differentially expressed genes related to metastasis 
and classified LUAD samples into two subtypes according to gene expression. 
Subsequently, a prediction model composed of eight metastasis-related genes 
(RHOBTB2, KIAA1524, CENPW, DEPDC1, RFLNA, COL7A1, MMP12, and HOXB9) was 
constructed. The areas under the curves of the logistic regression and neural 
network were 0.946 and 0.856, respectively. The model effectively classified 
patients into low- and high-risk groups. The low-risk group had a better 
prognosis in both the training and test cohorts, indicating that the prediction 
model had good diagnostic and predictive power. Upregulation of RFLNA 
successfully promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and attenuated 
apoptosis, suggesting that RFLNA plays a role in promoting LUAD development and 
metastasis.
CONCLUSION: The model has important diagnostic and prognostic value for 
metastatic LUAD and may be useful in clinical applications."
436,"The genus Acidovorax is a genetically heterogeneous species clustering that 
comprises many environmental and plant-pathogenic taxa. To better understand the 
evolutionary relationships among the Acidovorax species, 22 available genome 
sequences of type strains including the genera Acidovorax and Comamonas were 
used to conduct the genome-based analyses. Three well-supported monophyletic 
clusters of the Acidovorax species were determined based on the phylogenomic 
tree reconstructed using core genes, while they were not grouped in the 16S rRNA 
gene-based phylogenetic tree. The species arrangements of the genus Acidovorax 
were further confirmed by the comparisons of the digital DNA-DNA hybridization 
and average nucleotide identity (ANI) values. The ANI, average amino acid 
identity, and the percentage of conserved proteins values among the 
inter-clusters were approximately 83, 81, and 61%, respectively, and thus were 
proposed as practical thresholds for genus delineation. Besides, Acidovorax 
antarcticus was much closer to members of the genus Comamonas rather than those 
of the genus Acidovorax based on the genome-based analysis. Taken together, we 
propose the division of the current genus Acidovorax into the emended genus 
Acidovorax and the two novel genera Paracidovorax gen. nov., Paenacidovorax gen. 
nov. and the transfer of Acidovorax antarcticus into the genus Comamonas as 
Comamonas antarctica comb. nov."
437,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-enclosed nanoparticles that 
deliver bioactive proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other small molecules 
from donor to recipient cells. They have attracted significant interest recently 
due to their important roles in regulating plant-microbe interaction. During 
microbial infection, plant EVs play a prominent role in defense by delivering 
small regulatory RNA into pathogens, resulting in the silencing of pathogen 
virulence genes. Pathogens also deliver small RNAs into plant cells to silence 
host immunity genes. Recent evidence indicates that microbial EVs may be 
involved in pathogenesis and host immunity modulation by transporting RNAs and 
other biomolecules. However, the biogenesis and function of microbial EVs in 
plant-microbe interaction remain ill-defined. In this review, we discuss various 
aspects of microbial EVs, with a particular focus on current methods for EV 
isolation, composition, biogenesis, and their roles in plant-microbe 
interaction. We also discussed the potential role of microbial EVs in 
cross-kingdom RNA trafﬁcking from pathogens to plants, as it is a highly likely 
possibility to explore in the future."
438,"The genes encoding the phosphate uptake system in Xanthomonas citri pv. glycines 
12-2 were previously found to be upregulated when in soybean leaves. This study 
thus explored the role of the phosphate uptake system on its virulence to 
soybean. While phoB and pstSCAB mutants were greatly impaired in both inciting 
disease symptoms and growth in soybean, the virulence and growth in soybean of a 
phoU mutant was not reduced when compared with the wildtype strain. The 
expression of phoB and pstSCAB was highly induced in phosphate-deficient media. 
In addition, the expression of phoB, assessed with a fusion to a promoterless 
ice nucleation reporter gene, was greatly increased in soybean leaves, 
confirming that the soybean apoplast is a phosphorus-limited habitat for X. 
citri pv. glycines. Global gene expression profiles of phoB and phoU mutants of 
X. citri pv. glycines conducted under phosphate limitation conditions in vitro 
using RNA-seq revealed that PhoB positively regulated genes involved in signal 
transduction, the xcs cluster type II secretion system, cell motility, and 
chemotaxis, while negatively regulating cell wall and membrane biogenesis, DNA 
replication / recombination and repair, and several genes with unknown function. 
PhoU also positively regulated the same genes involved in cell motility and 
chemotaxis. The severity of bacterial pustule disease was decreased in soybean 
plants grown under high phosphate fertilization conditions, demonstrating that 
high phosphate availability in soybean plants can affect infection by X. citri 
pv. glycines by modulation of the expression of phosphate uptake systems."
439,"IMPORTANCE: Most studies of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 
genetics have used kidney specialty cohorts, focusing on PKD1 and PKD2. These 
can lead to biased estimates of population prevalence of ADPKD-associated gene 
variants and their phenotypic expression.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of ADPKD and contributions of PKD1, PKD2, 
and other genes related to cystic kidney disease in a large, unselected cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective observational study used 
an unselected health system-based cohort in central and northeast Pennsylvania 
with exome sequencing (enrolled from 2004 to 2020) and electronic health record 
data (up to October 2021). The genotype-first approach included the entire 
cohort and the phenotype-first approach focused on patients with ADPKD diagnosis 
codes, confirmed by chart and imaging review.
EXPOSURES: Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in PKD1, PKD2, and other genes 
associated with cystic kidney disease (ie, ALG8, ALG9, DNAJB11, GANAB, HNF1B, 
IFT140, SEC61B, PKHD1, PRKCSH, SEC63); likely pathogenic missense variants in 
PKD1 and PKD2.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Genotype-first analysis: ADPKD diagnosis code 
(Q61.2, Q61.3, 753.13, 753.12); phenotype-first analysis: presence of a rare 
variant in PKD1, PKD2, or other genes associated with cystic kidney disease.
RESULTS: Of 174 172 patients (median age, 60 years; 60.6% female; 93% of 
European ancestry), 303 patients had ADPKD diagnosis codes, including 235 with 
sufficient chart review data for confirmation. In addition to PKD1 and PKD2, LOF 
variants in IFT140, GANAB, and HNF1B were associated with ADPKD diagnosis after 
correction for multiple comparisons. Among patients with LOF variants in PKD1, 
66 of 68 (97%) had ADPKD; 43 of 43 patients (100%) with LOF variants in PKD2 had 
ADPKD. In contrast, only 24 of 77 patients (31.2%) with a PKD1 missense variant 
previously classified as ""likely pathogenic"" had ADPKD, suggesting 
misclassification or variable penetrance. Among patients with ADPKD diagnosis 
confirmed by chart review, 180 of 235 (76.6%) had a potential genetic cause, 
with the majority being rare variants in PKD1 (127 patients) or PKD2 (34 
patients); 19 of 235 (8.1%) had variants in other genes associated with cystic 
kidney disease. Of these 235 patients with confirmed ADPKD, 150 (63.8%) had a 
family history of ADPKD. The yield for a genetic determinant of ADPKD was higher 
for those with a family history of ADPKD compared with those without family 
history (91.3% [137/150] vs 50.6% [43/85]; difference, 40.7% [95% CI, 
29.2%-52.3%]; P < .001). Previously unreported PKD1, PKD2, and GANAB variants 
were identified with pedigree data suggesting pathogenicity, and several PKD1 
missense variants previously reported as likely pathogenic appeared to be 
benign.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study demonstrates substantial genetic and 
phenotypic variability in ADPKD among patients within a regional health system 
in the US."
440,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment of melanoma. 
However, the majority of patients have primary or acquired resistance to ICIs, 
limiting durable responses and patient survival. Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) 
signaling and the expression of IFNγ-stimulated genes correlate with either 
response or resistance to ICIs, in a context-dependent manner. While 
IFNγ-inducible immunostimulatory genes are required for response to ICIs, 
chronic IFNγ signaling induces the expression of immunosuppressive genes, 
promoting resistance to these therapies. Here, we show that high levels of ULK1 
correlate with poor survival in melanoma patients and overexpression of ULK1 in 
melanoma cells enhances IFNγ-induced expression of immunosuppressive genes, with 
minimal effects on the expression of immunostimulatory genes. In contrast, 
genetic or pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 reduces expression of IFNγ-induced 
immunosuppressive genes. ULK1 binds IRF1 in the nuclear compartment of melanoma 
cells, controlling its binding to the PD-L1 promoter region. Additionally, 
pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy further 
reduces melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Our data suggest that targeting ULK1 
represses IFNγ-dependent immunosuppression. These findings support the 
combination of ULK1 drug-targeted inhibition with ICIs for the treatment of 
melanoma patients to improve response rates and patient outcomes. Implications: 
This study identifies ULK1, activated downstream of IFNγ signaling, as a 
druggable target to overcome resistance mechanisms to ICI therapy in metastatic 
melanoma."
441,"BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial disorder with 
altered intestinal motility, secretion, and sensation. Serotonin (5-HT) 
stimulates gut motility and alters serotonin signaling that may lead to both 
intestinal and extraintestinal symptoms in IBS.
AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the association of serotonin 
transporter gene promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in IBS with orocecal transit 
time (OCTT) measured by lactulose hydrogen breath test.
METHOD: This prospective case-control study included 151 IBS patients (mean±SD 
37.4±11.6 years, median 36, range 19-68). Ninety-two patients were 
diarrhea-predominant IBS (D-IBS), 44 constipation-predominant IBS (C-IBS), 15 
alternating diarrhea and constipation IBS (M-IBS), and 100 healthy controls 
(mean±SD 37.2±11.4 years, median 36, range 20-64 years). 5-HTTLPR gene 
polymorphism was studied by polymerase chain reaction-based method. 5-HT levels 
were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Orocecal transit 
time (OCTT) was measured by a non-invasive lactulose hydrogen breath test. OCTT 
was also compared with respect to 5-HTTLPR genotypes in different IBS 
phenotypes.
RESULTS: Serum serotonin levels were significantly higher in overall IBS 
patients (152±77 ng/mL, p<0.001), D-IBS (184±76 ng/mL, p<0.001), compared to 
healthy controls (129±56 ng/mL). There was no difference in 5-HT levels between 
C-IBS (124±53 ng/mL) and controls. In the case of M-IBS, 5-HT levels were (88±49 
ng/mL p<0.05) significantly lower than that of controls. OCTT was significantly 
shorter in D-IBS patients (95±36 min) as compared to controls (112±41 min). In 
contrast, C-IBS showed significantly prolonged OCTT (136±54 min). There was a 
significant difference in OCTT between D-IBS and C-IBS patients (p<0.001). There 
was no significant association found between OCTT and 5-HTTLPR.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum serotonin concentrations were increased in D-IBS compared to 
controls and C-IBS. OCTT was shorter in D-IBS and delayed in C-IBS patients. 
There was no association of 5-HTLPR polymorphism with OCTT."
442,"Genomic data provide valuable insights into pest management issues such as 
resistance evolution, historical patterns of pest invasions and ongoing 
population dynamics. We assembled the first reference genome for the redlegged 
earth mite, Halotydeus destructor (Tucker, 1925), to investigate adaptation to 
pesticide pressures and demography in its invasive Australian range using 
whole-genome pool-seq data from regionally distributed populations. Our 
reference genome comprises 132 autosomal contigs, with a total length of 
48.90 Mb. We observed a large complex of ace genes, which has presumably evolved 
from a long history of organophosphate selection in H. destructor and may 
contribute towards organophosphate resistance through copy number variation, 
target-site mutations and structural variants. In the putative ancestral H. 
destructor ace gene, we identified three target-site mutations (G119S, A201S and 
F331Y) segregating in organophosphate-resistant populations. Additionally, we 
identified two new para sodium channel gene mutations (L925I and F1020Y) that 
may contribute to pyrethroid resistance. Regional structuring observed in 
population genomic analyses indicates that gene flow in H. destructor does not 
homogenize populations across large geographic distances. However, our 
demographic analyses were equivocal on the magnitude of gene flow; the short 
invasion history of H. destructor makes it difficult to distinguish scenarios of 
complete isolation vs. ongoing migration. Nonetheless, we identified clear 
signatures of reduced genetic diversity and smaller inferred effective 
population sizes in eastern vs. western populations, which is consistent with 
the stepping-stone invasion pathway of this pest in Australia. These new 
insights will inform development of diagnostic genetic markers of resistance, 
further investigation into the multifaceted organophosphate resistance mechanism 
and predictive modelling of resistance evolution and spread."
443,"Water-soluble humic materials (WSHMs) can enhance the nodule numbers of soybean 
plants. In this study, targeted metabolomics and transcriptomics were used to 
understand this mechanism. Results showed that 500 mg/L WSHM increased the 
adsorption and colonization of rhizobia in soybean roots. High-performance 
liquid chromatography and targeted metabolomics showed that WSHMs could regulate 
the content and distribution of endogenous hormones of soybean plants at the 
initial stage of soybean nodulation. Transcriptomic analysis showed a total of 
2406 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by the 25th day, accounting for 4.89% 
of total annotation genes (49159). These DEGs were found to contribute primarily 
to the MAPK signaling pathway, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and plant hormone 
signal transduction according to the -log 10 (Padjust) value in the KEGG 
pathway. Subsequently, DEGs related to these hormones were selected for 
verification using quantity-PCR. The WSHM increased the number of nodules by 
regulating the expression of endogenous hormones in soybean plants."
444,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) seriously threatens human health and generally 
results from dysfunction of relevant module molecules, which dynamically change 
with time and conditions, rather than that of an individual molecule. In this 
study, a novel network construction algorithm for identifying early warning 
network signals (IEWNS) is proposed for improving the performance of LUAD early 
diagnosis. To this end, we theoretically derived a dynamic criterion, namely, 
the relationship of variation (RV), to construct dynamic networks. RV infers 
correlation [Formula: see text] statistics to measure dynamic changes in 
molecular relationships during the process of disease development. Based on the 
dynamic networks constructed by IEWNS, network warning signals used to represent 
the occurrence of LUAD deterioration can be defined without human intervention. 
IEWNS was employed to perform a comprehensive analysis of gene expression 
profiles of LUAD from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The experimental results suggest that the 
potential biomarkers selected by IEWNS can facilitate a better understanding of 
pathogenetic mechanisms and help to achieve effective early diagnosis of LUAD. 
In conclusion, IEWNS provides novel insight into the initiation and progression 
of LUAD and helps to define prospective biomarkers for assessing disease 
deterioration."
445,"Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is a nutritionally important fruit of high nutritive 
value, delicious in taste with an attractive aroma. Due to their antioxidant and 
therapeutic potential, mango fruits are receiving special attention in 
biochemical and pharmacognosy-based studies. Fruit quality determines consumer's 
acceptance, and hence, understanding the physiological, biochemical, and 
molecular basis of fruit development, maturity, ripening, and storage is 
essential. Transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic, and molecular genetic 
approaches have led to the identification of key genes, metabolites, protein 
candidates, and quantitative trait loci that are associated with enhanced mango 
fruit quality. The major pathways that determine the fruit quality include amino 
acid metabolism, plant hormone signaling, carbohydrate metabolism and transport, 
cell wall biosynthesis and degradation, flavonoid and anthocyanin biosynthesis, 
and carotenoid metabolism. Expression of the polygalacturonase, cutin synthase, 
pectin methyl esterase, pectate lyase, β-galactosidase, and ethylene 
biosynthesis enzymes are related to mango fruit ripening, flavor, firmness, 
softening, and other quality processes, while genes involved in the MAPK 
signaling pathway, heat shock proteins, hormone signaling, and phenylpropanoid 
biosynthesis are associated with diseases. Metabolomics identified volatiles, 
organic acids, amino acids, and various other compounds that determine the 
characteristic flavor and aroma of the mango fruit. Molecular markers 
differentiate the mango cultivars based on their geographical origins. Genetic 
linkage maps and quantitative trait loci studies identified regions in the 
genome that are associated with economically important traits. The review 
summarizes the applications of omics techniques and their potential applications 
toward understanding mango fruit physiology and their usefulness in future mango 
breeding."
446,"Dysregulation of the gut microbiota by environmental factors is associated with 
a variety of autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases. In addition, 
naturally-occurring extracellular antibiotic resistance genes (eARGs) might 
directly enter the gut via the food chain. However, following gut microbiota 
exposure to eARGs, the ecological processes shaping the microbiota community 
assembly, as well as the interplay between the microbiota composition, metabolic 
function, and the immune responses, are not well understood. Increasing focus on 
the One Health approach has led to an urgent need to investigate the direct 
health damage caused by eARGs. Herein, we reveal the significant influence of 
eARGs on microbiota communities, strongly driven by stochastic processes. How 
eARGs-stimulate variations in the composition and metabolomic function of the 
gut microbiota led to cytokine responses in mice of different age and sex were 
investigated. The results revealed that cytokines were significantly associated 
with immunomodulatory microbes, metabolites, and ARGs biomarkers. Cytokine 
production was associated with specific metabolic pathways (arachidonic acid and 
tryptophan metabolic pathways), as confirmed by ex vivo cytokine responses and 
recovery experiments in vivo. Furthermore, the gut microbial profile could be 
applied to accurately predict the degree of intestinal inflammation ascribed to 
the eARGs (area under the curve = 0.9616). The present study provided a 
comprehensive understanding of the influence of an eARGs on immune responses and 
intestinal barrier damage, shedding light on the interplay between eARGs, 
microbial, metabolites, and the gut antibiotic resistome in modulating the human 
immune system."
447,"A growing body of evidence suggests that RNA interference (RNAi) plays a pivotal 
role in the communication between plants and pathogenic fungi, where a 
bi-directional trans-kingdom RNAi is established to the advantage of either the 
host or the pathogen. Similar mechanisms acting during plant association with 
non-pathogenic symbiotic microorganisms have been elusive to this date. To 
determine whether root endophytes can induce systemic RNAi responses to their 
host plants, we designed an experimental reporter-based system consisting of the 
root-restricted, beneficial fungal endophyte, Fusarium solani strain K (FsK) and 
its host Nicotiana benthamiana. Since not all fungi encode the RNAi machinery, 
we first needed to validate that FsK does so, by identifying its core RNAi 
enzymes (2 Dicer-like genes, 2 Argonautes and 4 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) 
and by showing its susceptibility to in vitro RNAi upon exogenous application of 
double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). Upon establishing this, we transformed FsK with a 
hairpin RNA (hpRNA) construct designed to target a reporter gene in its host N. 
benthamiana. The hpRNA was processed by FsK RNAi machinery predominantly into 
21-24-nt small RNAs that triggered RNA silencing but not DNA methylation in the 
fungal hyphae. Importantly, when the hpRNA-expressing FsK was used to inoculate 
N. benthamiana, systemic RNA silencing and DNA methylation of the host reporter 
gene was recorded. Our data suggest that RNAi signals can be translocated by 
root endophytes to their hosts and can modulate gene expression during 
mutualism, which may be translated to beneficial phenotypes."
448,"There has been substantial recent interest in the promise of sustainable, 
light-driven bioproduction using cyanobacteria, including developing efforts for 
microbial bioproduction using mixed autotroph/heterotroph communities, which 
could provide useful properties, such as division of metabolic labor. However, 
building stable mixed-species communities of sufficient productivity remains a 
challenge, partly due to the lack of strategies for synchronizing and 
coordinating biological activities across different species. To address this 
obstacle, we developed an inter-species communication system using quorum 
sensing (QS) modules derived from well-studied pathways in heterotrophic 
microbes. In the model cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (S. 
elongatus), we designed, integrated, and characterized genetic circuits that 
detect acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), diffusible signals utilized in many QS 
pathways. We showed that these receiver modules sense exogenously supplied AHL 
molecules and activate gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. We 
characterized these AHL receiver circuits in parallel with Escherichia coli W 
(E. coli W) to dissect species-specific properties, finding broad agreement, 
albeit with increased basal expression in S. elongatus. Our engineered ""sender"" 
E. coli strains accumulated biologically synthesized AHLs within the supernatant 
and activated receiver strains similarly to exogenous AHL activation. Our 
results will bolster the design of sophisticated genetic circuits in 
cyanobacterial/heterotroph consortia and the engineering of QS-like behaviors 
across cyanobacterial populations."
449,"This study assessed the bacterial community composition of a drinking water 
system (DWS) serving a mid-sized city (120,000 inhabitants) in Brazil. Water 
samples, including raw and treated water, were collected at seven points 
throughout the DWS. DNA was extracted and analysed using high-throughput 
sequencing (Ion Torrent). Free chlorine and turbidity were measured in situ. 
Results showed that the highest relative abundance of 16S rRNA genes was from 
phyla Proteobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. The next 
most abundant phylum was Cyanobacteria, represented by Arthronema, Calothrix, 
and Synechococcus. An interesting observation was that the DNA-based analysis 
suggested a bacterial community change in the distribution network, with treated 
reservoir water being very different from the network samples. This suggests 
active microbiology within the distribution network and a tendency for bacterial 
diversity to decrease after chlorine disinfection but increase after pipeline 
distribution. In raw water, a predominance of Proteobacteria was observed with 
reduced Cyanobacteria, showing a negative correlation. In treated water, 
Proteobacteria were negatively correlated with Bacteroidetes. Finally, 16S rRNA 
genes from Firmicutes (especially Staphylococcus) had a high abundance in the 
chlorinated water, which may indicate the phylum's resistance to chlorine 
residuals. Opportunistic pathogens, e.g., Mycobacteria, Legionella, and 
Staphylococcus, were also observed."
450,"Rice (Oryza sativa) is an important staple crop to address the Hidden Hunger 
problem not only in Asia but also in Africa where rice is fast becoming an 
important source of calories. The brown rice (whole grain with bran) is known to 
be more nutritious due to elevated mineral composition. The genetics underlying 
brown rice ionome (sum-total of such mineral composition) remains largely 
unexplored. Hence, we conducted a comprehensive study to dissect the genetic 
architecture of the brown rice ionome. We used genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS), gene-set analysis, and targeted association analysis for 12 
micronutrients in the brown rice grains. A diverse panel of 300 resequenced 
indica accessions, with more than 1.02 million single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs), was used. We identified 109 candidate genes with 5 to 20% phenotypic 
variation explained (PVE) for the 12 micronutrients and identified epistatic 
interactions with multiple micronutrients. Pooling all candidate genes per 
micronutrient exhibited PVE values ranging from 11% to almost 40%. The key donor 
lines with larger concentrations for most of the micronutrients possessed 
superior alleles which were absent in the breeding lines. Through gene 
regulatory networks we identified enriched functional pathways for central 
regulators that were detected as key candidate genes through GWAS. This study 
provided important insights on the ionome variations in rice, on the genetic 
basis of the genome-ionome relationships and on the molecular mechanisms 
underlying micronutrient signatures."
451,"Transposable elements (TEs) are an important source of genome variability, 
playing many roles in the evolution of eukaryotic species. Besides well-known 
phenomena, TEs may undergo the exaptation process and generate the so-called 
exapted transposable element genes (ETEs). Here we present a genome-wide survey 
of ETEs in the large genome of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), in which the 
massive amount of TEs, provides a significant source for exaptation. A library 
of sunflower TEs was used to build TE-specific Hidden Markov Model profiles, to 
search for all available sunflower gene products. In doing so, 20,016 putative 
ETEs were identified and further investigated for the characteristics that 
distinguish TEs from genes, leading to the validation of 3,530 ETEs. The 
analysis of ETEs transcription patterns under different stress conditions showed 
a differential regulation triggered by treatments mimicking biotic and abiotic 
stress; furthermore, the distribution of functional domains of differentially 
regulated ETEs revealed a relevant presence of domains involved in many aspects 
of cellular functions. A comparative genomic investigation was performed 
including species representative of Asterids and appropriate outgroups: the bulk 
of ETEs resulted specific to the sunflower, while few ETEs presented orthologues 
in the genome of all analysed species, making the hypothesis of a conserved 
function. This study highlights the crucial role played by exaptation, actively 
contributing to species evolution."
452,"BACKGROUND: Epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation are understood as an 
intermediary between environmental factors and neurobiology. Cerebral monoamine 
oxidase A (MAO-A) levels are altered in depression, as are DNA methylation 
levels within the MAOA gene, particularly in the promoter / exon I / intron I 
region. An effect of MAOA methylation on peripheral protein expression was 
shown, but the extent to which methylation affects brain MAO-A levels is not 
fully understood.
METHODS: Here, the influence of MAOA promoter / exon I / intron I region DNA 
methylation on global MAO-A distribution volume (VT), an index of MAO-A density, 
was assessed via [ 11C]harmine positron emission tomography in 22 patients (14 
females) suffering from seasonal affective disorder and 30 healthy controls (17 
females).
RESULTS: No significant influence of MAOA DNA methylation on global MAO-A VT was 
found, despite correction for health status, sex, season and MAOA variable 
number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genotype. However, season affected average 
methylation in women, with higher levels in spring and summer (puncorr = 0.03). 
We thus did not find evidence for an effect of MAOA DNA methylation on brain 
MAO-A VT.
CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to a previous study demonstrating an effect of 
methylation of a MAOA promoter region located further 5' on brain MAO-A, MAOA 
methylation of the region assessed here appears to affect brain protein levels 
to a limited extent at most. The observed effect of season on methylation levels 
is in accordance with extensive evidence for seasonal effects within the 
serotonergic system."
453,"BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Converging lines of evidence suggest that dysfunction 
of cortical GABAergic inhibitory interneurons is a core feature of psychosis. 
This dysfunction is thought to underlie neuroimaging abnormalities commonly 
found in patients with psychosis, particularly in the hippocampus. These include 
increases in resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and glutamatergic metabolite 
levels, and decreases in ligand binding to GABAA α5 receptors and to the 
synaptic density marker synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). However, direct 
links between inhibitory interneuron dysfunction and these neuroimaging readouts 
are yet to be established. Conditional deletion of a schizophrenia 
susceptibility gene, the tyrosine kinase receptor Erbb4, from cortical and 
hippocampal inhibitory interneurons leads to synaptic defects, and behavioral 
and cognitive phenotypes relevant to psychosis in mice.
STUDY DESIGN: Here, we investigated how this inhibitory interneuron disruption 
affects hippocampal in vivo neuroimaging readouts. Adult Erbb4 conditional 
mutant mice (Lhx6-Cre;Erbb4F/F, n = 12) and their wild-type littermates 
(Erbb4F/F, n = 12) were scanned in a 9.4T magnetic resonance scanner to quantify 
CBF and glutamatergic metabolite levels (glutamine, glutamate, GABA). 
Subsequently, we assessed GABAA receptors and SV2A density using quantitative 
autoradiography.
RESULTS: Erbb4 mutant mice showed significantly elevated ventral hippccampus CBF 
and glutamine levels, and decreased SV2A density across hippocampus sub-regions 
compared to wild-type littermates. No significant GABAA receptor density 
differences were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that specific disruption of cortical 
inhibitory interneurons in mice recapitulate some of the key neuroimaging 
findings in patients with psychosis, and link inhibitory interneuron deficits to 
non-invasive measures of brain function and neurochemistry that can be used 
across species."
454,"Emerging evidence reveals that the three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture 
plays a key regulatory role in various biological processes of plants. However, 
information on the 3D chromatin architecture of legume model plant Medicago 
truncatula and its potential roles in the regulation of response to mineral 
nutrient deficiency are very limited. Using Hi-C sequencing, we identified the 
3D genome structure of M. truncatula in terms of A/B compartments, topologically 
associated domains (TADs) and chromatin loops. The gene density, expressional 
level and active histone modification were higher in A compartments than in B 
compartments. Moreover, we analyzed the 3D chromatin architecture reorganization 
in response to phosphorus (P) deficiency. The intra-chromosomal cis-interaction 
proportion was increased by P deficiency, and a total of 748 A/B compartment 
switch regions were detected. In these regions, density change of H3K4me3 and 
H3K27ac modification were associated with expression of P deficiency-responsive 
genes involved in root system architecture and hormonal response. Further, these 
genes enhanced the P uptake and mobilization by increasing root surface area and 
strengthening the signal transduction under P deficiency. These findings advance 
our understanding of the potential roles of 3D chromatin architecture in 
responses of plants in general and M. truncatula in particular to P deficiency."
455,"In vitro-cultured oocytes are separated from the follicular microenvironment in 
vivo and are more vulnerable than in vivo oocytes to changes in the external 
environment. This vulnerability disrupts the homeostasis of the intracellular 
environment, affecting oocyte meiotic completion and subsequent embryonic 
developmental competence in vitro. Glycine, one of the main components of 
glutathione (GSH), plays an important role in the protection of porcine oocytes 
in vitro. However, the protective mechanism of glycine needs to be further 
clarified. Our results showed that glycine supplementation promoted cumulus cell 
expansion and oocyte maturation. Detection of oocyte development ability showed 
that glycine significantly increased the cleavage rate and blastocyst rate 
during in vitro fertilization (IVF). SMART-seq revealed that this effect was 
related to glycine-mediated regulation of cell membrane structure and function. 
Exogenous addition of glycine significantly increased the levels of the 
antioxidant GSH and the expression of antioxidant-related genes (glutathione 
peroxidase 4 (GPX4), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), superoxide 
dismutase 2 (SOD2) and mitochondrial solute carrier family 25, member 39 
(SLC25A39)), decreased the lipid peroxidation caused by reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and reduced the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) by enhancing the functions 
of mitochondria, peroxisomes and lipid droplets (LDs) and the levels of lipid 
metabolism-related factors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor 
coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ 
(PPARγ), sterol regulatory element binding factor 1 (SREBF1), autocrine motility 
factor receptor (AMFR), and ATP). These effects further reduced ferroptosis and 
maintained the normal structure and function of the cell membrane. Our results 
suggest that glycine plays an important role in oocyte maturation and later 
development by regulating ROS-induced lipid metabolism, thereby protecting 
against biomembrane damage."
456,"BACKGROUND: The X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is a DNA repair 
gene. Various studies have examined the association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp 
polymorphism and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) susceptibility 
with contradictory results. So, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed 
to assess whether variants of this polymorphism increase the HNSCC risk or not.
RECENT FINDINGS: Thirty three studies consisting of 14282 subjects (6012 cases 
and 8270 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Variants of XRCC1 
Arg194Trp polymorphism were associated with increased HNSCC risk and the 
associations were significant based on heterozygous and dominant models 
(heterozygous model: OR = 1.182, 95%CI = 1.015-1.377, P = 0.032; homozygous 
model: OR = 1.274, 95%CI = 0.940-1.727, P = 0.119; dominant model: OR = 1.194,

0.885-1.576, P = 0.119). There were significant associations between variants of 
this polymorphism and HNSCC risk based on Asian ethnicity under dominant model, 
hospital control source under different genetic models, PCR-RFLP genotyping 
method under dominant model and oral cavity tumor site under heterozygous and 
dominant models.
OBJECTIVE: The X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is a DNA repair 
gene. Various studies have examined the association between XRCC1 Arg194Trp 
polymorphism and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) susceptibility 
with contradictory results. So, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed 
to assess whether variants of this polymorphism increase the HNSCC risk or not.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literatures published till April 2022 was 
conducted using Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library 
and Embase databases. The heterogeneity was assessed with the I-Square 
statistic. A random effects model or fixed effects model was used to analyze the 
data. Data were reported by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). 
The p value was considered significant if p < .05.
RESULTS: Thirty three studies consisting of 14 282 subjects (6012 cases and 8270 
controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Variants of XRCC1 Arg194Trp 
polymorphism were associated with increased HNSCC risk and the associations were 
significant based on heterozygous and dominant models (heterozygous model: 
OR = 1.182, 95%CI = 1.015-1.377, p = .032; homozygous model: OR = 1.274, 
95%CI = 0.940-1.727, p = .119; dominant model: OR = 1.194, 95%CI = 1.027-1.388, 
p = .021; recessive model: OR = 1.181, 95%CI = 0.885-1.576, p = .119). There 
were significant associations between variants of this polymorphism and HNSCC 
risk based on Asian ethnicity under dominant model, hospital control source 
under different genetic models, PCR-RFLP genotyping method under dominant model 
and oral cavity tumor site under heterozygous and dominant models.
CONCLUSION: Variants of XRCC1 Arg194Trp polymorphism were significantly 
associated with increased risk of HNSCC development based on heterozygous and 
dominant genetic models."
457,"The relatively quiet mutational landscape of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) suggests 
that epigenetic deregulation could be central to oncogenesis and tumour 
aggressiveness. Histone variants have long been recognised as important 
epigenetic regulators of gene expression. However, the role of histone variants 
in RMS has not been studied hitherto. In this study, we show that histone 
variant H3.3 is overexpressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), an aggressive 
subtype of RMS. Functionally, knockdown of H3F3A, which encodes for H3.3, 
significantly impairs the ability of ARMS cells to undertake migration and 
invasion and reduces Rho activation. In addition, a striking reduction in 
metastatic tumour burden and improved survival is apparent in vivo. Using 
RNA-sequencing and ChIP-sequencing analyses, we identified Melanoma Cell 
Adhesion Molecule (MCAM/CD146) as a direct downstream target of H3.3. Loss of 
H3.3 resulted in a reduction in the presence of active marks, and an increase in 
the occupancy of H1 at the MCAM promoter. Cell migration and invasion were 
rescued in H3F3A-depleted cells through MCAM overexpression. Moreover, we 
identified G9a, a lysine methyltransferase encoded by EHMT2, as an upstream 
regulator of H3F3A. Therefore, this study identifies a novel H3.3 dependent axis 
involved in ARMS metastasis. These findings establish the potential of MCAM as a 
therapeutic target for high-risk ARMS patients. This article is protected by

458,"Growing interest in i-motif DNA as a transcriptional regulatory element 
motivates development of synthetic molecules capable of targeting these 
structures. In this study, we designed unmodified peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and 
gamma-modified PNA (γPNA) oligomers complementary to an i-motif forming sequence 
derived from the promoter of the KRAS oncogene. Biophysical techniques such as 
circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, CD melting, and fluorescence spectroscopy 
demonstrated the successful invasion of the i-motif by PNA and γPNA. Both PNA 
and γPNA showed very strong binding to the target sequence with high thermal 
stability of the resulting heteroduplexes. Interestingly fluorescence and CD 
experiments indicated formation of an intermolecular i-motif structure via the 
overhangs of target-probe heteroduplexes formed by PNA/γPNA invasion of the 
intramolecular i-motif. Targeting promoter i-motif forming sequences with 
high-affinity oligonucleotide mimics like γPNAs may represent a new approach for 
inhibiting KRAS transcription, thereby representing a potentially useful 
anti-cancer strategy."

460,"Cancer is one of the major contributors to human mortality and has a serious 
influence on human survival and health. In biomedical research, the 
identification of cancer driver genes (cancer drivers for short) is an important 
task; cancer drivers can promote the progression and generation of cancer. To 
identify cancer drivers, many methods have been developed. These computational 
models only identify coding cancer drivers; however, non-coding drivers likewise 
play significant roles in the progression of cancer. Hence, we propose a 
Network-based Method for identifying cancer Driver Genes based on node Control 
Centrality (NMDGCC), which can identify coding and non-coding cancer driver 
genes. The process of NMDGCC for identifying driver genes mainly includes the 
following two steps. In the first step, we construct a gene interaction network 
by using mRNAs and miRNAs expression data in the cancer state. In the second 
step, the control centrality of the node is used to identify cancer drivers in 
the constructed network. We use the breast cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) to verify the effectiveness of NMDGCC. Compared with the existing 
methods of cancer driver genes identification, NMDGCC has a better performance. 
NMDGCC also identifies 295 miRNAs as non-coding cancer drivers, of which 158 are 
related to tumorigenesis of BRCA. We also apply NMDGCC to identify driver genes 
related to the different breast cancer subtypes. The result shows that NMDGCC 
detects many cancer drivers of specific cancer subtypes."
461,"Elevated expression of lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) contributes to the malignant 
tumor progression in multiple cancers. However, the role of LOXL2 in the 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. 
This study aimed to explore the effects of LOXL2 on 5-FU sensitivity in CRC. The 
mRNA and protein levels of LOXL2 were explored in public databases by 
bioinformatics, validated in clinical tissues using immunohistochemistry, and 
detected in 5-FU treated cell lines. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) 
values were quantified based on the cell viability at different concentrations 
of 5-FU with CCK-8 assays. Colony formation and flow cytometry assays were 
performed to measure the proliferation and apoptosis rates. Gene set enrichment 
and correlation analyses were conducted to identify the probable mechanism of 
LOXL2 in TCGA samples. Critical molecules of the Hedgehog signaling pathway and 
anti-apoptotic BCL2 in protein levels were detected with Western blotting. It 
concluded that LOXL2 was up-regulated and positively linked to the unfavorable 
prognosis of CRC patients. The LOXL2 expression increased with the rising 5-FU 
concentrations, especially at 20 and 40 μM. Elevated LOXL2 promoted the 
resistance to 5-FU, augmented the proliferation, and inhibited 5-FU-induced 
apoptosis of CRC cells. LOXL2 activated the Hedgehog signaling pathway by 
promoting the expression of SMO, GLI1, and GLI2, leading to the upregulation of 
downstream target gene BCL2 in CRC cells. Moreover, the Hedgehog signaling 
pathway inhibitor cyclopamine blocked the BCL2 upregulation mediated by LOXL2. 
This study has demonstrated that LOXL2 can reduce 5-FU sensitivity through the 
Hedgehog/BCL2 signaling pathway in CRC."
462,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived liver organoids serve as 
models of organogenesis, disease, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. 
Prevailing methods for generating organoids rely on Matrigel, whose 
batch-to-batch variability and xenogeneic source pose challenges to mechanistic 
research and translation to human clinical therapy. In this report, we 
demonstrate that self-assembled Matrigel-free iPSC-derived organoids developed 
in rotating wall vessels (RWVs) exhibit greater hepatocyte-specific functions 
than organoids formed on Matrigel. We show that RWVs produce highly-functional 
liver organoids in part by eliminating the need for Matrigel, which has adverse 
effects on hepatic lineage differentiation. RWV liver organoids sustain durable 
function over long-term culture and express a range of mature functional genes 
at levels comparable to adult human liver, while retaining some fetal features. 
Our results indicate that RWVs provide a simple and high-throughput way to 
generate Matrigel-free liver organoids suitable for research and clinical 
applications."
463,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major aetiology associated with the development and 
progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary liver 
malignancy. Over the past few decades, direct and indirect mechanisms have been 
identified in the pathogenesis of HBV-associated HCC which include altered 
signaling pathways, genome integration, mutation-induced genomic instability, 
chromosomal deletions and rearrangements. Intertwining of the HBV counterparts 
with the host cellular factors, though well established, needs to be systemized 
to understand the dynamics of host-HBV crosstalk and its consequences on HCC 
progression. Existence of a vast array of protein-protein and protein-nucleic 
acid interaction databases has led to the uncoiling of the compendia of 
genes/gene products associated with these interactions. This review covers the 
existing knowledge about the HBV-host interplay and brings it down under one 
canopy emphasizing on the HBV-host interactomics; and thereby highlights new 
strategies for therapeutic advancements against HBV-induced HCC. This article is

464,"Sulfur mustard (SM) is a chemical warfare agent with well-known severe toxic 
effects and may cause long-term debilitating injuries. We aimed to evaluate 
aging and longevity in Iranian SM-exposed survivors using some endocrine and 
molecular biomarkers for the first time. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 
prolactin (PRL), cortisol, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) were 
measured in 289 male SM-veterans and 66 age-matched males using the ELISA 
method. Leukocyte Telomere Length (LTL) measurement and p16INK4a expression were 
measured in the peripheral blood leukocytes of 55 males who were exposed to SM. 
We found a significantly lower serum DHEAS level and higher serum PRL level in 
SM-exposed groups (without any related to the severity of lung injuries) 
compared to healthy controls, but no significant difference in serum levels of 
cortisol, testosterone, and LH. The molar ratio of DHEAS/cortisol was 
significantly higher in controls compared to the SM-exposed individuals 
especially those with severe lung damage. Some biological parameters of 
allostatic load score such as DHEAS and DHEAS/cortisol ratio significantly 
decreased long-term after the SM exposure. Additionally, we found that LTL was 
shorter in SM-exposed veterans rather than unexposed controls while p16INK4a 
gene expression significantly increased in these groups. It seems that DHEAS, 
DHEAS/cortisol ratio, LTL, and p16INK4a gene expression have changed 
significantly in favor of cellular senescence in SM-exposed patients. Therefore, 
it seems that SM exposure increases biological age compared to chronological age 
in SM-exposed survivors."
465,"Plasmid fitness is directed by two orthogonal processes-vertical transfer 
through cell division and horizontal transfer through conjugation. When 
considered individually, improvements in either mode of transfer can promote how 
well a plasmid spreads and persists. Together, however, the metabolic cost of 
conjugation could create a tradeoff that constrains plasmid evolution. Here, we 
present evidence for the presence, consequences, and molecular basis of a 
conjugation-growth tradeoff across 40 plasmids derived from clinical Escherichia 
coli pathogens. We discover that most plasmids operate below a conjugation 
efficiency threshold for major growth effects, indicating strong natural 
selection for vertical transfer. Below this threshold, E. coli demonstrates a 
remarkable growth tolerance to over four orders of magnitude change in 
conjugation efficiency. This tolerance fades as nutrients become scarce and 
horizontal transfer attracts a greater share of host resources. Our results 
provide insight into evolutionary constraints directing plasmid fitness and 
strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance."
466,"For proper functioning of the nervous system, it is crucial that neurons find 
their appropriate partners and build the correct neural connection patterns. 
Although cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) have been studied for many years as 
essential players in neural connections, we have yet to unravel the code by 
which CAMs encode synaptic specificity. We analyzed the effects of mutations in 
CAM genes on the morphology and synapses of a set of sensory neurons in the 
C.　elegans male tail. B-type ray sensory neurons express ten genes encoding 
CAMs. We examined the effect on axon trajectory and localization of presynaptic 
components in viable mutants of nine of these. We found axon trajectory defects 
in mutants of UNC-40/DCC, SAX-3/ROBO, and FMI-1/Flamingo/Celsr1. None of the 
mutations caused loss of presynaptic components in axons, and in several the 
level even appeared to increase, suggesting possible accumulation of 
presynapses. B-type sensory neurons fasciculate with a second type of ray 
sensory neuron, the A-type, in axon commissures. We found a CAM expressed in 
A-type functions additively with a CAM expressed in B-type in B-type axon 
guidance, and lack of a CAM expressed in B-type affected A-type axon guidance. 
Overall, single and multiple mutants of CAM genes had limited effects on ray 
neuron trajectories and accumulation of synaptic components."
467,"Abscisic acid (ABA) drives stomatal closure to minimize water loss due to 
transpiration in response to drought. We examined the subcellular location of 
ABA increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells, 
which drive stomatal closure, in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). 
ABA-dependent increases in fluorescence of the generic ROS sensor, 
dichlorofluorescein (DCF), were observed in mitochondria, chloroplasts, cytosol, 
and nuclei. The ABA response in all these locations were lost in an 
ABA-insensitive quintuple receptor mutant. The ABA-increased fluorescence in 
mitochondria of both DCF and an H2O2-selective probe, Peroxy Orange 1 (PO1), 
colocalized with Mitotracker Red. ABA treatment of guard cells transformed with 
the genetically-encoded H2O2 reporter targeted to the cytoplasm (roGFP2-Orp1), 
or mitochondria (mt-roGFP2-Orp1), revealed H2O2 increases. Consistent with 
mitochondrial ROS changes functioning in stomatal closure, we found that guard 
cells of a mutant with mitochondrial defects, ABA overly sensitive 6 (abo6), 
have elevated ABA-induced ROS in mitochondria and enhanced stomatal closure. 
These effects were phenocopied with rotenone, which increased mitochondrial ROS. 
In contrast, the mitochondrially targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, dampened ABA 
effects on mitochondrial ROS accumulation and stomatal closure in Col-0 and 
reversed the guard cell closure phenotype of the abo6 mutant. ABA-induced ROS 
accumulation in guard cell mitochondria was lost in mutants in genes encoding 
Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog (RBOH) enzymes and reduced by treatment with 
the RBOH inhibitor VAS2870, consistent with RBOH machinery acting in 
ABA-increased ROS in guard cell mitochondria. These results demonstrate that ABA 
elevates H2O2 accumulation in guard cell mitochondria to promote stomatal 
closure."
468,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are contingent upon clinical manifestations 
and serological markers. However, researchers are struggling to find biomarkers 
with higher sensitivity and specificity. DNA methylation has been the most 
studied epigenetic feature in SLE. So, in this study, we performed a systematic 
review of studies about DNA methylation alterations in SLE patients compared to 
healthy controls.
METHODS: By searching PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to July 2022, all 
case-control studies in which DNA methylation of specific genes was assessed by 
a non-high-throughput technique and passed the quality of bias assessment were 
included.
RESULTS: In total, 44 eligible studies underwent a data extraction process. In 
all, 3471 SLE patients and 1028 healthy individuals were included. Among the 
studies that reported the patients' gender (n = 2853), 89.41% were female and 
10.59% were male. Forty studies have been conducted on adult patients. The 
number of works on fractionated and unfractionated blood cells was almost equal. 
In this regard, 22 studies were conducted on whole blood or peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells and two studies on unfractionated white blood cells. Sorted 
blood cells were biological sources in 20 studies. The most investigated gene 
was IFI44L. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic power of methylation levels 
were only reported for IFI44L in five studies. The most employed methylation 
profiling method was bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction. The 
correlation between methylation patterns and clinical parameters was explored in 
22 studies, which of them 16 publications displayed a remarkable association 
between DNA methylation status and clinical indices.
CONCLUSIONS: The methylation status of some genes especially IFI44L, FOXP3, and 
MX1 has been suggested as promising SLE biomarkers. However, given the 
conflicting findings between studies because of potential confounders such as 
different sample types, methylation profiling methods, and ethnicity as well as 
shared DNA methylation patterns of SLE and other autoimmune diseases, DNA 
methylation biomarkers are currently not reliable diagnostic biomarkers and do 
not represent surrogate markers of SLE disease activity. Future investigations 
on a larger scale with the discarding of limitations of previous studies would 
probably lead to a consensus."
469,"Studies prior to next-generation sequencing (NGS) showed that the frequent 
indolent course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is related to most cells 
remaining quiescent in the G0 -G1 cell cycle phase, due to the expression of 
dysregulated cyclin genes. Of note, the activating nature of the NOTCH1 mutation 
in T lymphoblastic leukaemia also drives the dysregulation of cell cycle genes. 
Our goal was to comprehensively revisit the cell cycle in NOTCH1-mutated CLL 
(NOTCH1MUT ) to test for potential therapeutic targets. Among 378 NGS-annotated 
CLL cases, NOTCH1MUT cells displayed a unique transcriptome profile of G0 -G1 
cell cycle components, with an overexpression of early-phase effectors, reaching 
a 38-, 27- and ninefold change increase for the complex elements CCND3, CDK4 and 
CDK6, respectively. This NOTCH1MUT cells' profile was related to more cells 
traversing through the cell cycle. In-vitro targeted inhibition of NOTCH1 
gamma-secretase and CDK4/6 reversed the distribution of cells through the cycle 
phases and enhanced the killing of NOTCH1MUT CLL cells, suggesting new 
therapeutic approaches."
470,"BACH2 [BTB (broad-complex, tramtrak and bric à brac) and CNC (cap 'n' collar) 
homolog 2] is known as a transcriptional repressor and broadly functions in 
regulating immune cell differentiation. Here, we focus on BACH2 function in B 
cells, where BACH2 was first shown to play an important role in the immune 
system. In B cells, BACH2 orchestrates the gene regulatory network that promotes 
class-switch and affinity-maturation of antibodies and simultaneously represses 
plasma-cell differentiation. In this context, BACH2 regulates gene expression by 
modulating chromatin organization, cooperatively with other transcription 
factors and chromatin regulators, such as IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) 
and PC4 (positive coactivator 4), respectively. In addition, our recent 
observation raises the possibility that BACH2 has diverse functions, such as 
those in gene activation. Since dysfunction of BACH2 leads to the onset of human 
immune deficiencies, revealing new functions of BACH2 may give a cue to solve 
how BACH2 contributes to preventing these diseases."
471,"BACKGROUND: Genomic profile analysis using next-generation sequencing can 
potentially elucidate the pathogenesis of rare cancers. Ductal adenocarcinoma, a 
rare subtype of prostate cancer, has an aggressive nature. This is the first 
study to analyze the genomic profile of ductal adenocarcinoma in an Asian 
population.
METHODS: We identified 12 patients newly diagnosed with ductal adenocarcinoma of 
the prostate at two hospitals, and nine patients (75.0%) had the pure type. 
Genomic assessment was performed using either the PleSSision testing platform or 
FoundationOne CDx.
RESULTS: At least one genomic alteration occurred in 11 patients (91.7%), and 
the most frequently mutated gene was tumor suppressor protein p53 (TP53), which 
was found in six cases (50.0%). Alterations characteristic of this cohort were 
found in four cases (33.3%) of retinoblastoma transcriptional corepressor 1 
(RB1), which was only observed in the pure type. Compared to previous study 
results, the frequency of genetic alterations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
(PI3K) pathway (n = 3; 25.0%) and Wnt-β-catenin pathway (n = 5; 41.7%) was 
comparable, but no alterations in the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway were 
observed. None of the patients presented high tumor mutation burden or 
microsatellite instability.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that the Asian cohort with ductal adenocarcinoma had 
actionable alterations, and a high frequency of alterations in TP53 and RB1 
reflected the aggressive nature of the tumor. Genetic analysis using 
next-generation sequencing is expected to help elucidate the pathogenesis of 
ductal adenocarcinoma."
472,"BACKGROUND: IFNL4 genetic variants that are strongly associated with clearance 
of hepatitis C virus have been linked to risk of certain opportunistic 
infections (OIs) and cancers, including Kaposi sarcoma, cytomegalovirus 
infection, and herpes simplex virus infection. As the interferon (IFN) λ family 
plays a role in response to viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, IFNL4 
genotype might affect risk for a wide range of OIs/cancers.
METHODS: We examined associations between genotype for the functional IFNL4 
rs368234815 polymorphism and incidence of 16 OIs/cancers among 2310 men with 
human immunodeficiency virus (2038 white; 272 black) enrolled in the Multicenter 
AIDS Cohort Study during 1984-1990. Our primary analyses used Cox proportional 
hazards models adjusted for self-reported racial ancestry to estimate hazard 
ratios with 95% confidence intervals, comparing participants with the genotypes 
that generate IFN-λ4 and those with the genotype that abrogates IFN-λ4. We 
censored follow-up at the introduction of highly effective antiretroviral 
therapies.
RESULTS: We found no statistically significant association between IFNL4 
genotype and the incidence of Kaposi sarcoma (hazard ratio, 0.92 [95% confidence 
interval, .76-1.11]), cytomegalovirus infection (0.94 [.71-1.24]), herpes 
simplex virus infection (1.37 [.68-2.93]), or any other OI/cancer. We observed 
consistent results using additive genetic models and after controlling for CD4 
cell count through time-dependent adjustment or restriction to participants with 
a low CD4 cell count.
CONCLUSIONS: The absence of associations between IFNL4 genotype and these 
OIs/cancers provides evidence that this gene does not affect the risk of disease 
from opportunistic pathogens."
473,"The kidney tubule consists of a single layer of epithelial cells supported by 
the tubular basement membrane (TBM), a thin layer of specialized extracellular 
matrix (ECM). The mechanical properties of the ECM are important for regulating 
a wide range of cell functions including proliferation, differentiation and cell 
survival. Increased ECM stiffness plays a role in promoting multiple 
pathological conditions including cancer, fibrosis and heart disease. How 
changes in TBM mechanics regulate tubular epithelial cell behavior is not fully 
understood. Here we introduce a cell culture system that utilizes in 
vivo-derived TBM to investigate cell-matrix interactions in kidney proximal 
tubule cells. Basement membrane mechanics was controlled using genipin, a 
biocompatibility crosslinker. Genipin modification resulted in a dose-dependent 
increase in matrix stiffness. Crosslinking had a marginal but statistically 
significant impact on the diffusive molecular transport properties of the TBM, 
likely due to a reduction in pore size. Both native and genipin-modified TBM 
substrates supported tubular epithelial cell growth. Cells were able to attach 
and proliferate to form confluent monolayers. Tubular epithelial cells polarized 
and assembled organized cell-cell junctions. Genipin modification had minimal 
impact on cell viability and proliferation. Genipin stiffened TBM increased gene 
expression of pro-fibrotic cytokines and altered gene expression for N-cadherin, 
a proximal tubular epithelial specific cell-cell junction marker. This work 
introduces a new cell culture model for cell-basement membrane mechanobiology 
studies that utilizes in vivo-derived basement membrane. We also demonstrate 
that TBM stiffening affects tubular epithelial cell function through altered 
gene expression of cell-specific differentiation markers and induced increased 
expression of pro-fibrotic growth factors."
474,"CONTEXT: The advent of immune check inhibitors (ICIs) has tremendously changed 
the prognosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), adding an unseen 
substantial overall survival benefit. These agents could be administered alone 
or in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) 
therapies. So far, treatment allocation is based only on clinical stratification 
risk models.
OBJECTIVE: Herein, we aimed to report the different molecular classifications 
reported in the first-line treatment of mRCC and discuss the awaited clinical 
implications in terms of treatment selection.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Medline database as well as European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO)/American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference 
proceedings were searched to identify biomarker studies. Inclusion criteria 
comprised randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials that included patients 
treated in the first line of mRCC setting, patients treated with anti-VEGF 
therapies or ICIs, biological modeling, and available survival outcomes.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Four classification models were identified with subsequent 
clinical implications: Beuselinck model (34 gene signatures), IMmotion150, 
Hakimi, and JAVELIN 101 model. Tumor profiling shows distinct outcomes when 
treated with one or other combination. Patients are clustered into two gene 
signatures: angiogenic and proinflammatory (as per JAVELIN). The first is more 
likely to respond to therapy that includes anti-VEGF agents, while the best 
outcomes are obtained with an ICI combination with the second.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings presented here were mostly derived from ancillary 
registered studies of new drugs in the setting of mRCC. Further validation is 
needed, which sets new paradigms for investigation in clinical research based on 
tumor biology for treatment allocation and not only on clinical stratification 
tools.
PATIENT SUMMARY: First-line treatment of metastatic kidney includes 
immunotherapy alone or in combination with antiangiogenic therapy. However, 
clinical practice demonstrated that the ""one treatment fits all"" strategy might 
not be the best approach. In fact, recent studies showed that the addition of 
immunotherapy agents will not benefit all patients equally, and some still 
respond either equally to or better than anti-vascular endothelial growth factor 
alone. This review revealed biomarker modeling that impacts treatment selection. 
Recent tumor profiling into ""angiogenic signature"" more sensitive to angiogenic 
agents versus ""immune signature"" more likely to achieve the best response with 
immunotherapy should be validated. Tumor biology features might be more powerful 
than clinical classification for a tailored treatment approach."
475,"The idea of cancer immunotherapy has spread, and it has made tremendous progress 
with the advancement of new technology. Immunotherapy, which serves to assist 
the natural defenses of the body in eradicating cancerous cells, is a remarkable 
achievement that has revolutionized both cancer research and cancer treatments. 
Currently, the use of stem cells in immunotherapy is widespread and shares a 
special characteristic, including cancer cell migration, bioactive component 
release, and immunosuppressive activity. In the context of cancer, mesenchymal 
stem cells (MSCs) are rapidly being identified as vital stromal regulators of 
tumor progression. MSCs therapy has been implicated in treating a wide range of 
diseases, including bone damage, autoimmune diseases, and particularly 
hematopoietic abnormalities, providing stem cell-based therapy with an extra 
dimension. Moreover, the implication of MSCs does not have ethical concerns, and 
the complications known in pluripotent and totipotent stem cells are less common 
in MSCs. MSCs have a lot of distinctive characteristics that, when coupled, make 
them excellent for cellular-based immunotherapy and as vehicles for gene and 
drug delivery in a variety of inflammations and malignancies. MSCs can migrate 
to the inflammatory site and exert immunomodulatory responses via cell-to-cell 
contacts with lymphocytes by generating soluble substances. In the current 
review, we discuss the most recent research on the immunological characteristics 
of MSCs, their use as immunomodulatory carriers, techniques for approving MSCs 
to adjust their immunological contour, and their usages as vehicles for 
delivering therapeutic as well as drugs and genes engineered to destroy tumor 
cells."
476,"BACKGROUND: In most patients with frontotemporal lobe degeneration (FTLD), the 
degenerative process begins between the ages 45 and 65 years; onset younger than 
45 years is relatively rare and considered very early onset FTLD (VEO-FTLD).
OBJECTIVE: To delineate the clinical, genetic, and pathological features of 
VEO-FTLD.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out in PubMed and Embase 
from inception to September 2021. Patients diagnosed with definite FTLD with 
onset before age 45 years were included. Patients lacking detailed clinical data 
or both genetic and neuropathological data were excluded. Phenotypic, genotypic, 
and pathological data were extracted for further analyses.
RESULTS: Data from 110 patients with VEO-FTLD, reported in a cumulative 70 
publications, were included. Age of onset was 35.09 ± 7.04 (14-44) years. 
Sixty-seven patients were reported age at death of 42.12 ± 7.26 (24-58) years, 
with a disease course lasting 8.13 ± 4.69 (1-20) years. Behavioural variant 
frontotemporal dementia (104/110, 94.5%) was the most common clinical subtype, 
often manifesting as disinhibition (81.8%) and apathy (80.9%), and frequently 
accompanied by a cognitive deficit (90.9%) and parkinsonism (37.3%). Familial 
aggregate was high (familial vs sporadic, 73/37, 66.4%); most patients carried 
MAPT gene mutations (72.9% familial, 40% sporadic), followed by C9 (18.8% 
familial, 10.0% sporadic), TARDBP (2.1% familial), and VCP (2.1% familial). The 
most common neuropathology subtype was tau (43.5%), followed by 
ubiquitin-positive (24.6%), FUS (20.3%), and TDP 43 (2.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: VEO-FTLD may have unique clinical, genetic, and neuropathological 
markers and should be considered in young patients with psycho-behavioral 
symptoms."
477,"KAT6A syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder associated with 
intellectual disability due to mutations in the lysine acetyltransferase 6A 
(KAT6A) gene. There are some differences in phenotype between KAT6A gene 
variants. This current case report describes a 1-month-old male infant that had 
a nonsense mutation in the KAT6A gene. Neither of his parents had the mutation. 
The proband had feeding difficulties and a physical examination revealed the 
following: moderate dysphagia, hypoplastic laryngeal cartilage, poor 
audio-visual response, poor head-up ability, no active grasping awareness, 
microcephaly, high arched palate and he was significantly behind other children 
of the same age. Echocardiography showed that the foramen ovale was not closed. 
He was diagnosed with atrial septal defect (ASD) when 2 years old. The patient 
received ASD repair at 32 months of age. Head colour Doppler ultrasonography and 
brain magnetic resonance imaging showed cysts in the right ventricle and choroid 
plexus, which returned to normal at 2 years of age. This current case 
demonstrates that immediate surgery should be considered in newborns with KAT6A 
syndrome presenting with a heart malformation. A new KAT6A syndrome phenotype is 
described in this current case report, which requires early diagnosis and 
treatment."
478,"BACKGROUND Carney complex (CNC) is a rare multiple neoplasia syndrome with 
autosomal dominant inheritance. CNC is frequently misdiagnosed owing to its 
diverse clinical characteristics. We reported the case of a 14-year-old Saudi 
boy with a history of gynecomastia, Cushing syndrome, large-cell calcifying 
Sertoli cell tumor of the testis, and CNC. CASE REPORT The patient was referred 
to the pediatric endocrine clinic for evaluation of bilateral slow progressing 
gynecomastia for 1-year duration. His clinical examination revealed lentigenes, 
bilateral diffuse breast enlargement (consistent with Tanner stage III), and 
asymmetrical testicular enlargement, more on the left side. Other systemic 
examinations were unremarkable. The initial blood workup showed elevated 
estradiol level with unsuppressed cortisol after an overnight 1-mg dexamethasone 
suppression test. Breast ultrasound (US) confirmed true gynecomastia. Testicular 
US revealed microcalcification and the testicular biopsy confirmed diagnoses of 
large-cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumor (LCCSCT). A 2-step dexamethasone 
suppression test showed a paradoxical rise in serum and urine cortisol levels, 
which are characteristic for PPNAD. LCCSCT and PPNAD are 2 major criteria 
fulfilling a diagnosis of CNC. The gene test showed heterozygous mutation in the 
PRKAR1A gene, which is diagnostic for CNC. The patient underwent bilateral 
mastoplasty and was planned for radical left orchiectomy. CONCLUSIONS 
Gynecomastia and LCCSCT can be presenting features of CNC, which mandates 
careful, thorough clinical examination and tailored investigation to reach a 
diagnosis."
479,"The maize (Zea mays) ear represents one of the most striking domestication 
phenotypes in any crop species, with the cob conferring an exceptional yield 
advantage over the ancestral form of teosinte. Remodeling of the grain-bearing 
surface required profound developmental changes. However, the underlying 
mechanisms remain unclear and can only be partly attributed to the known 
domestication gene Teosinte glume architecture 1 (Tga1). Here we show that a 
more complete conversion involves strigolactones (SLs), and that these are 
prominent players not only in the Tga1 phenotype, but also other domestication 
features of the ear and kernel. Genetic combinations of a teosinte tga1 allele 
with three SL-related mutants progressively enhanced ancestral morphologies. The 
SL mutants, in addition to modulating the tga1 phenotype, also reshaped 
kernel-bearing pedicels and cupules in a teosinte-like manner. Genetic and 
molecular evidence are consistent with SL regulation of TGA1, including direct 
interaction of TGA1 with components of the SL-signaling system shown here to 
mediate TGA1 availability by sequestration. Roles of the SL network extend to 
enhancing maize seed size and, importantly, coordinating increased kernel growth 
with remodeling of protective maternal tissues. Collectively, our data show that 
SLs have central roles in releasing kernels from restrictive maternal encasement 
and coordinating other factors that increase kernel size, physical support, and 
their exposure on the grain-bearing surface."
480,"BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is a pathogen responsible for nosocomial 
infections, especially in patients with burns and ventilator-associated 
pneumonia (VAP). The aims of this study was to compare the biofilm formation 
capacity, antimicrobial resistance patterns and molecular typing based on PFGE 
(Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis) in A. baumannii isolated from burn and VAP 
patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 A. baumannii isolates were obtained from 
burn and VAP patients. In this study, we assessed antimicrobial susceptibility, 
biofilm formation capacity, PFGE fingerprinting, and the distribution of 
biofilm-related genes (csuD, csuE, ptk, ataA, and ompA).
RESULTS: Overall, 74% of the strains were multidrug resistant (MDR), and 26% 
were extensively drug-resistant (XDR). Regarding biofilm formation capacity, 
52%, 36%, and 12% of the isolates were strong, moderate, and weak biofilm 
producers. Strong biofilm formation capacity significantly correlated with XDR 
phenotype (12/13, 92.3%). All the isolates harbored at least one biofilm-related 
gene. The most prevalent gene was csuD (98%), followed by ptk (90%), ataA (88%), 
ompA (86%), and csuE (86%). Harboring all the biofilm-related genes was 
significantly associated with XDR phenotype. Finally, PFGE clustering revealed 6 
clusters, among which cluster No. 2 showed a significant correlation with strong 
biofilm formation and XDR phenotype.
CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed the variable distribution of biofilm-related 
genes among MDR and XDR A. baumannii isolates from burn and VAP patients. A 
significant correlation was found between strong biofilm formation capacity and 
XDR phenotype. Finally, our results suggested that XDR phenotype was predominant 
among strong-biofilm producer A. baumannii in our region."
481,"Differences in gene-wide DNA methylation of the Alzheimer's disease 
(AD)-associated genes BIN1, HLA-DRB5, SORL1, SLC24A4, and ABCA7 are reported to 
be associated with AD in post-mortem brain samples. We investigated whether the 
same associations could be found in leukocytes collected pre-mortem. Using 
cohort data of 544 Swedish twins (204 dementia diagnoses), we replicated the 
findings in HLA-DRB5 and SLC24A4 at P < 0.05. However, co-twin control analyses 
indicated that the associations were partly explained by familial confounding. 
Thus, DNA methylation differences in HLA-DRB5 and SLC24A4 are present in both 
neuronal cells and leukocytes, and not fully explained familial factors."
482,"BACKGROUND: Although many biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) have been 
identified, their specificity and sensitivity remain unsatisfactory. Endothelial 
lipase gene (LIPG) plays an important role in a variety of cancers, but its role 
in lung adenocarcinoma remains unclear.
METHODS: TCGA, GEO, K-M plotter, CIBERSORT, GSEA, HPA, and GDSC were used to 
analyze LIPG in LUAD. Data analysis was mainly achieved by R 4.0.3.
RESULTS: The expression of LIPG in LUAD tissues was higher than that in adjacent 
normal tissues, especially in women, patients aged >65 years, and those with 
lymph node metastasis. High expression predicted a poor prognosis. The results 
of enrichment analysis suggest that LIPG may exert profound effects on the 
development of LUAD through multiple stages of lipid metabolism and immune 
system regulation. In addition, LIPG expression was significantly correlated 
with the expression levels of multiple immune checkpoint genes and the abundance 
of multiple immune infiltrates, including the activated memory CD4 T cell, M1 
macrophage, neutrophil, plasma cells, and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells in the 
LUAD microenvironment content. At the same time, patients with high LIPG 
expression respond well to a variety of antitumor drugs and have a low rate of 
drug resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: LIPG is a prognostic marker and is associated with lipid metabolism 
and immune infiltration in LUAD."
483,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic process altered in cancer and ageing. 
Age-related methylation drift can be used to estimate lifespan and can be 
influenced by extrinsic factors such as diet. Here, we report that 
non-pathogenic microbiota accelerate age-related methylation drift in the colon 
when compared with germ-free mice. DNA methylation analyses showed that 
microbiota and IL10KO were associated with changes in 5% and 4.1% of CpG sites, 
while mice with both factors had 18% alterations. Microbiota, IL10KO, and their 
combination altered 0.4%, 0.4%, and 4% of CpG island methylation, respectively. 
These are comparable to what is seen in colon cancer. Ageing changes were 
accelerated in the IL10KO mice with microbiota, and the affected genes were more 
likely to be altered in colon cancer. Thus, the microbiota affect DNA 
methylation of the colon in patterns reminiscent of what is observed in ageing 
and colorectal cancer."
484,"OBJECTIVE: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are new targeted therapies used to 
treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) due to RET gene 
rearrangements. The objective of this article is to review selpercatinib and 
pralsetinib in the context of RET-fusion-positive NSCLC.
DATA SOURCES: The pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials were evaluated regarding 
the use of selpercatinib and pralsetinib as treatment for RET-fusion-positive 
NSCLC. Comparative studies, review articles and current studies on selpercatinib 
and pralsetinib in RET-fusion-positive NSCLC were searched on pubmed.org and 
scholar.google.com using ""selpercatinib,"" ""pralsetinib,"" and ""NSCLC"" as 
keywords. Product monographs were searched on google.ca and uptodate.com using 
the keywords ""selpercatinib,"" ""pralsetinib,"" and/or ""monograph.""
DATA SUMMARY: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are orally administered highly 
selective RET inhibitors approved by the FDA following the accelerated approvals 
granted due to the pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials which evaluated 
selpercatinib and pralsetinib, respectively. Both drugs have shown efficacy for 
brain metastases and are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 through hepatic 
metabolism. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse effects of selpercatinib were 
hypertension, increased ALT level, and increased AST level while for 
pralsetinib, it was neutropenia, hypertension, and anemia. The safety profile 
shows similarities in severity and tolerability but additional monitoring for QT 
prolongation in patients on selpercatinib is recommended, compared to the risks 
of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis for patients on pralsetinib.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the increased use of selpercatinib and pralsetinib has led 
to the implementation of these drugs in the clinical practice of healthcare 
professionals such as pharmacists."
485,"BACKGROUND: Congenital coagulation factor VII (FVII) deficiency is a rare, 
autosomal-recessive haemorrhagic disorder with an estimated incidence of 
1:500,000. This disorder is caused by mutations in the F7 gene.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Here, we report a pedigree of congenital FVII deficiency. The 
proband was a 30-year-old female with severely low FVII activity and a history 
of menorrhagia and epistaxis since her childhood who was subsequently diagnosed 
with congenital compound heterozygous FVII deficiency. A genetic study revealed 
a novel combination of compound heterozygous mutations (c.64G 〉 A, p.Gly22Ser 
and c.1027G 〉 A, p.Gly343Ser). Her father and older son had the c.64G 〉 A, 
p.Gly22Ser (heterozygous) mutation. Her mother and younger son had the c.1027G 〉 
A, p.Gly343Ser (heterozygous) mutation. The predicted results of PolyPhen-2 and 
MutationTaster indicated that these mutations were probably damaging and 
disease-causing, respectively.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified a novel combination of genetic 
mutations that could expand the mutant library and help in elucidating the 
pathogenesis of hereditary human coagulation FVII deficiency. A novel 
combination of compound heterozygous mutations was reported for the first time 
in Chinese individuals."
486,"BACKGROUND: Reports of cerebrovascular ischemia and stroke occurring as 
predominant neurological sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19), are increasingly evident within the literature. While various 
pathophysiological mechanisms have been postulated, including 
hypercoagulability, endothelial invasion, and systemic inflammation, discrete 
mechanisms for viral neurotropism remain unclear and controversial.
OBSERVATIONS: The authors present a unique case study of a 64-year-old male with 
acute COVID-19 infection and acute worsening of previously stable cerebral 
autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a rare heritable arteriopathy due to mutation in 
the Notch3 gene, which is critical for vascular development and tone. Delayed 
cranial neuropathies, brainstem fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal, and 
enhancement of olfactory and vagus nerves on magnetic resonance neurography in 
this patient further support viral neurotropism via cranial nerves in addition 
to cerebral vasculature.
LESSONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case in the literature 
that not only demonstrates the consequences of COVID-19 infection in a patient 
with altered cerebrovascular autoregulation such as CADASIL but also highlights

487,"Members of the Ralstonia solanacearum (Rs) species complex have recently been 
reported to cause bacterial wilt on southern highbush (SHB) blueberries in 
Florida (Norman et al. 2018), a disease first reported on blueberry (northern 
highbush; Vaccinium corymbosum) in New Jersey (Patel et al. 2013). SHB 
blueberries are widely grown in the southern United States, and SHB cultivars 
represent the majority of the blueberry acreage in Georgia - the U.S. state with 
the largest blueberry acreage (NASS 2022). In Fall 2020, three-year old SHB 
plants (cv. 'Indigocrisp') showing leaf bronzing, wilting, and dieback were 
collected from two field sites in Clinch County, GA. At these locations, 
numerous plants were rapidly dying, with symptoms appearing to have spread down 
rows. Plant material tested positive using the ImmunoStrip® for Rs (Agdia, Inc., 
Elkhart, IN). From one location, the remaining sample was submitted to 
USDA-APHIS Select Agent Services who determined that Rs was present but a select 
agent (Rs Race 3, Biovar 2) was not. Following this, six adjacent, symptomatic 
SHB plants were collected from the same field location. These plants tested 
positive using the ImmunoStrip® for Rs, and red-pigmented mucoid colonies 
typical of Rs formed within 48 h at 28°C on triphenyltetrazolium chloroide (TZC) 
isolation medium (Kelman 1954). DNA was extracted from pure Rs cultures using 
the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method (Doyle and Doyle 1987) and 
tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Primers pairs AMB013/AMB014 (Fegan 
and Prior 2005) and ENDO-F/ENDO-R (Ji et al. 2007) were used to amplify 558 nt 
and 843 nt portions of the 16S rRNA region and Rs endoglucanase gene, 
respectively. Resulting amplicons were purified using an E.Z.N.A.® Cycle Pure 
Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA), Sanger sequenced in both directions (Eurofins 
Genomics, Louisville, KY), and compared to publicly available Rs sequences in 
Genbank. The 16 rRNA sequence from all obtained isolates (accession ON938207) 
had 100% identity to Rs strain CFBP2957 (FP885897), while the endoglucase 
sequence (ON938206) had 100% identity to phylotype IIa, sequevar 5 Rs strain 
CIP-426 (MF461810) and phylotype IIa, sequevar 39 Rs strain 19-058 (MT314067), 
among others. To fulfill Koch's postulates, an isolate ('Ral21-1') was grown on 
TZC medium for 48 h at 28°C and suspended in 8.5 g/L NaCl at 1 x 108 CFU/ml. 
Five young, tissue cultured SHB plants (cv. 'Kestrel') in 25 cm pots were 
drenched with 50 ml of Rs suspension. For six weeks, plants were maintained in 
the greenhouse at 21-32°C. Typical bacterial wilt symptoms (leaf 
bronzing/scorching) developed in all inoculated plants, and infections were 
confirmed using Immunostrip®. Rs was reisolated and confirmed via PCR and 
sequencing as previously described. While Ralstonia has been known to cause 
disease on numerous crops in Georgia, this represents a first report of 
bacterial wilt in Georgia blueberries. Relative to rabbiteye blueberries (V. 
virgatum), recent reports suggest that SHB are much more susceptible to 
bacterial wilt (Conner et al. 2022). Accordingly, given the transition from 
rabbiteye to SHB within Georgia's blueberry production region over the past two 
decades and the ability of Rs to spread easily in water, soil, or via infected 
plant material, the presence of this disease within the state represents a 
significant threat to blueberry production. Additional characterization of 
Ralstonia isolates from Georgia may help assess the risk of future outbreaks."
488,"Pawpaw (Asimina triloba (L.) Dunal, Annonaceae) is a fruit tree native to 
eastern North America, increasingly grown for commercial production in the 
United States (Callaway, 1992; Layne, 1996), Europe, and Western Asia (Brannan 
and Coyle, 2021; Lolletti et al., 2021). In 2012, virus-like symptoms were 
noticed in a 0.3 ha pawpaw orchard at Michigan State University Plant Pathology 
Research Station; ~30% of the trees presented symptoms which included foliar 
mosaic, vein yellowing, and necrosis, and were first mistaken for nutrient 
(magnesium/zinc) deficiency. Trees were treated for magnesium/zinc deficiency 
but continued to decline in fruit yield and overall vigor, and typically died 
within 3─4years after symptoms were first observed (Fig. S1). Preliminary 
testing using Agdia ImmunoStrips for cucumber mosaic virus, impatiens necrotic 
spot virus, tobacco mosaic virus, tomato spotted wilt virus and the genus 
Potyvirus were negative. However, icosahedral virus particles were observed by 
TEM (Fig. S2). To establish virus identity, we deep-sequenced tissue from a 
symptomatic pawpaw obtained from same site in summer 2021. Virus particles were 
purified , and virion-associated nucleic acids (VANA) were extracted using the 
Purelink viral RNA/DNA kit (Invitrogen) (Maclot et al., 2021). Both viral RNA 
and DNA were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on the Illumina 
NextSeq 500 platform (GIGA, University of Liege, Belgium). A total of 574,274 
trimmed reads (150 nt read length) were de novo assembled using Geneious Prime 
2022.2.2 software (https://www.geneious.com) and subjected to BLASTn analysis. 
Two contigs of 7511 bp (average coverage: 1048) and 3924 bp (average coverage: 
3012) showed 94% and 95% nt identities with tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) RNA1 
isolate YW (MT042825) and RNA2 isolate OH19 (MT561435) respectively. These two 
contigs (Accession no. OP589177 and OP589178) covered the complete TRSV genome 
for each segment. HTS found no other plant-associated viral / virus-like 
sequences in this symptomatic pawpaw sample. To further confirm TRSV infection, 
leaf extract from this sample was tested with RT-PCR using primers specific to 
the RdRp gene of TRSV RNA1 (Forward, 5'-TAACCTCATTGCAGTTGATCCTT-3'; Reverse, 
5'-TAATTCAAGCTCAGGTCTCTTCT-3'; 739 bp amplicon) and the coat protein of TRSV 
RNA2 (Forward, 5'-TCATGCTTAAAGATGCAGATGTG-3'; Reverse, 
5'-TATAAAGCTCCGCACTAGAAAACA-3'; 753 bp amplicon). Sanger sequence analysis 
showed 99.5% and 99.8% nt identity between the amplicons and the HTS contigs 
(RNA1 and RNA2 respectively) assembled from the pawpaw sample, and the amplicons 
likewise matched GenBank TRSV sequences (91.7% and 95.6% nt identities 
respectively with TRSV RNA1 isolate CmTX-H (MN504766) and TRSV RNA2 isolate 
IA-1-2017 (MT563079)). We further screened for TRSV infection in leaves from 
four symptomatic and three non-symptomatic pawpaw trees collected from the same 
site in 2022. RT-PCR revealed positive infection in all four symptomatic samples 
and one of the three (33%) non-symptomatic samples. Our results confirm the 
presence of TRSV infection in symptomatic pawpaw trees and emphasize the 
importance of also monitoring non-symptomatic trees. We confirmed graft 
transmission with 100% transmission rate observed in 200 trees grafted from a 
TRSV-infected pawpaw (Shenandoah cultivar), and investigation of other 
transmission vectors is on going. Because of TRSV's wide host range (Tolin, 
2008), its broad transmission profile in other crops (via nematodes, thrips, 
seeds, sap inoculation, and grafting) (Hill and Whitham, 2014), and the notable 
decline observed in infected pawpaws from different cultivars (10-35, NC-1, 
Overleese, Pennsylvania-Golden, Shenandoah, Sunflower, Wabash), TRSV appears to 
pose a new threat to pawpaw orchards. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first report of TRSV infecting pawpaw in North America and the world."
489,"Tea plants (Camellia sinensis L.) are an important cash crop and are cultivated 
worldwide for their commercial value (Palanisamy et al. 2014). Tea gray blight 
is an important tea plant disease as it can cause a decline in tea quality and 
reduce yields by 20-30% (Sanjay et al. 2008). In August 2018, a disease survey 
was conducted on 400 ha of organic tea plantations in the Pu'er area of Yunnan 
Province (22.48° N, 100.58° E). The survey found that widespread disease was 
causing damage to 40% of the tea plantations and that the most seriously 
affected tea variety was Yunkang No. 10, which had an average disease incidence 
of 30-35%. The affected leaves grew small yellow-green spots on their tips or 
margins in the early stage that expanded into round or irregular brown spots 
with distinct concentric whorls and black conidial disks arranged in whorls when 
the humidity was high (Fig. 1A-B), which is consistent with tea gray blight 
disease (Zheng et al. 2021). Twenty-four diseased leaf samples were collected 
from four different tea plantations and transported to the Pu-Erh Tea Research 
Laboratory. Leaves with disease spots were cut into 4 mm ×4 mm square pieces, 
surface-sterilized with 75% alcohol for 1 min, disinfected with 1% sodium 
hypochlorite for 3 min, and washed thrice with sterile water. The tissue pieces 
were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates containing 100 µg ml-1 of 
chloramphenicol (Wang et al. 2021). After 3 d of culturing in the dark at 28 C, 
twenty pure cultures with similar morphology were obtained, and two 
representative isolates were selected and transferred into new PDA media. After 
7 d, circular fungal colonies with dense aerial mycelium produced black, wet 
spore masses that grew on the PDA media (Fig. 1C-D). The conidia were 
spindle-shaped with four septa, measuring 25.0 (21.0-26.0) × 6.0 (4.5-7.0) µm 
(n=15). The conidia had three median cells, two of which were dark brown in 
color with unclear separations, with a single basal hyaline appendage 3.8 
(3.5-4.5) µm (n=30) in length and 2-3 apical hyaline appendages 31 (27-35) µm in 
length (n=30) (Fig. 1E), similar to the conidial characteristics of 
Neopestalotiopsis piceana (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2014). Two isolates were 
selected for DNA extraction. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, 
partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-α) gene, and partial 
β-tubulin (tub2) gene were amplified using the ITS1F-ITS4 primer set (White et 
al 1990), the EF-1α-F and EF-1α-R primer sets (Li et al. 2018), and the tub1 and 
tub2 primers, respectively (Chauhan et al. 2007). The ITS (OP535632 to 
OP535632), tef1-α (OP589285,OP589287), and tub2 (OP589286,OP589288) sequences 
were submitted to NCBI GenBank. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool analysis 
demonstrated that these sequences were 100% similar to those of N. piceana 
isolates available in GenBank. The sequences were compared using the Mafft 
software package, and sequences with the same ID were concatenated using 
scripts. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using the MEGA 
(ver. 5.1) software package based on the concatenated sequences (ITS, tef1-α, 
and tub2). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that C-5 and B-3 showed 95% bootstrap 
support with N. piceana isolates in references (Fig. 2). According to the 
morphology and molecular characterization, C-5 and B-3 were identified as N. 
piceana. Pathogenicity tests on these two isolates were conducted using 36 
healthy tea plants. The leaves were scratched slightly with sterile toothpick 
tips, after which pathogen cakes (6 mm diameter) were placed on the wounds with 
the mycelial side facing down and covered with sterile absorbent cotton to 
maintain a moist environment. Control leaves were wounded and covered with 
sterile PDA plugs (three replicates per treatment, three plants per replicate). 
Seven days later, the inoculated leaves exhibited similar symptoms observed 
under natural conditions, whereas the control leaves exhibited no symptoms. The 
same isolates as the introduced strains were isolated from the diseased tea 
leaves, completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report 
of N. piceana causing gray blight on tea leaves in China. These results provide 
valuable information for the prevention and management of gray blight on tea 
leaves. References: Chauhan, J. B., et al. 2007. Indian J Biotechnol. 6: 404-406

490,"Powdery mildew severely affects several important crops and cash plants. 
Disruption of mildew resistance locus O (MLO) genes elevates resistance against 
powdery mildew in several plants. However, whether rubber tree (Heveae 
brasiliensis) MLO proteins are linked to susceptibility remains unknown owing to 
technical limitations in the genetic manipulation of this woody plant. A 
previous study showed that the H. brasiliensis MLO-like protein HbMLO12 
demonstrates high amino acid sequence similarity with the known Arabidopsis MLO 
protein AtMLO12. In this study, we investigated whether HbMLO12 regulates 
susceptibility to powdery mildew. H. brasiliensis leaves take up exogenously 
synthesized double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), and foliar application of dsRNA 
homologous to HbMLO12 gene specifically induces HbMLO12 silencing in H. 
brasiliensis leaf tissues. Notably, HbMLO12 silencing inhibited fungal infection 
and elevated the immune response during interaction with the rubber tree powdery 
mildew fungus. Furthermore, the heterologous expression of HbMLO12 suppressed 
bacterial flg22- and fungal chitin-induced immune responses and enhanced 
bacterial infection in Arabidopsis. Our study provides evidence that HbMLO12 
contributes to susceptibility to powdery mildew."
491,"Adrenal cortical cancer has a relatively low incidence, but a dismal 5-year 
survival rate. Surgical intervention is the gold standard of care today. In 
spite of this progress, patients continue to have a dismal outlook. The results 
of this study demonstrate that kinin superfamily (KIF) has strong ties to many 
different types of cancers. However, their prognostic and immune cell 
infiltration of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) remain unclear. Multiple 
databases were searched for information on the transcription level of KIFs, its 
correlation with clinical data of ACC patients, patients' overall survival (OS), 
first progression survival (FPS), and progression free interval (PFI). Its role 
and association with immune cells were also investigated. We observed an 
increase in the expression of KIF4A, KIF11, KIF20A, and KIF22. There was a 
strong correlation between them and the advancedness of ACC tumors. Parallel to 
this, KIFs are connected to the concepts of operating systems, distributed file 
systems, and partitioned file systems. Similarly, we found five key genes, PRC1, 
PLK1, KIF23, KIFC1, and KIF5A, through data analysis, all of which participate 
in multiple cellular pathways. Both KIF4A and KIF11 expression levels were 
marginally positively correlated with immune infiltration. Because KIF4A, KIF11, 
KIF20A, and KIF22 are involved in multiple ACC processes and can influence the 
onset and progression of ACC, they provide a mechanistically grounded framework 
for diagnosing and managing the disease."
492,"BACKGROUND: Despite considerable recent reductions in antimicrobial use, the UK 
gamebird industry continues to struggle with production diseases during the 
rearing season, necessitating significant antibiotic use. This observational 
study investigated the presence of genes conferring resistance to β-lactam 
antibiotics within industry-reared pheasants and red-legged partridges in the 
UK.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from 60 pooled caecal samples collected from 
gamebirds at routine postmortem examinations during the rearing season. Genes 
encoding extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) were detected by PCR and the 
corresponding alleles were determined.
RESULTS: Over half (53%) of the samples harboured genes encoding blaTEM 
resistance, with blaSHV identified in 20% of samples. The blaTEM gene was more 
common on sites with higher antibiotic use, whereas blaSHV was predominantly 
found in birds younger than 5 weeks. Genotyping of the identified resistance 
genes revealed the presence of blaTEM-1 , blaSHV-1 and blaSHV-11 alleles.
LIMITATIONS: This was a small-scale study conducted at four sites in southern 
England.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of the presence of ESBL genes in gamebirds, 
highlighting the need for further research into antimicrobial resistance in UK 
gamebirds."
493,"BACKGROUND: Bacteria belonging to the genus Mycoplasma are small-sized, have no 
cell walls and small genomes. They commonly cause respiratory disorders in their 
animal hosts. Three species have been found in the respiratory tract of horses 
worldwide, i.e. Mycoplasma (M.) equirhinis, M. pulmonis and M. felis, but their 
role in clinical cases remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to i) develop and validate tools to 
detect, isolate and identify different Mycoplasma spp. strains in clinical 
equine respiratory-tract specimens and ii) subsequently define the prevalence of 
the three species in France depending on sample types and horse characteristics 
(age, breed, sex).
STUDY DESIGN: Validation of a workflow for mycoplasma diagnosis and subsequent 
prevalence study.
METHODS: Mycoplasma-free tracheal wash samples spiked with numerated strains and 
DNA dilutions were used to validate the culture methods and real-time PCR 
(rt-PCR) assay. Isolated strains were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. 
Prevalences were determined on a population of 616 horses with respiratory 
disorders, sampled in France in 2020.
RESULTS: In total, 104 horses (16.9%) were found to be positive for Mycoplasma 
spp. by at least one method. M. equirhinis was the predominant circulating 
species, accounting for 85% of the rt-PCR-positive samples and 98% of the 40 
cultured strains.
MAIN LIMITATION: The proposed pre-enrichment procedure improves the sensitivity 
of detection but hinders the quantification of initial mycoplasma load in the 
clinical specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of mycoplasma varied with age, breed, and type of 
sample. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
494,"Pectate lyases (Pels) have a vital function in degradation of the primary plant 
cell wall and the middle lamella and have been widely used in the industry. In 
this study, two pectate lyase genes, IDSPel16 and IDSPel17, were cloned from a 
sheep rumen microbiome. The recombinant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia 
coli and functionally characterized. Both IDSPel16 and IDSPel17 proteins had an 
optimal temperature of 60 ℃, and an optimal pH of 10.0. IDSPel16 was relatively 
stable below 60 °C, maintaining 77.51% residual activity after preincubation at 
60 °C for 1 h, whereas IDSPel17 denatured rapidly at 60 °C. IDSPel16 was 
relatively stable between pH 6.0 and 12.0, after pretreatment for 1 h, retaining 
over 60% residual activity. IDSPel16 had high activity towards polygalacturonic 
acid, with a Vmax of 942.90 ± 68.11, whereas IDSPel17 had a Vmax of only 
28.19 ± 2.23 μmol/min/mg. Reaction product analyses revealed that IDSPel17 
liberated unsaturated digalacturonate (uG2) and unsaturated trigalacturonate 
(uG3) from the substrate, indicating a typical endo-acting pectate lyase (EC 
4.2.2.2). In contrast, IDSPel16 initially generated unsaturated 
oligogalacturonic acids, then converted these intermediates into uG2 and 
unsaturated galacturonic acid (uG1) as end products, a unique depolymerization 
profile among Pels. To the best of our knowledge, the IDSPel16 discovered with 
both endo-Pel (EC 4.2.2.2) and exo-Pel (EC 4.2.2.9) activities. These two 
pectate lyases, particularly the relatively thermo- and pH-stable IDSPel16, will 
be of interest for potential application in the textile, food, and feed 
industries. KEY POINTS: • Two novel pectate lyase genes, IDSPel16 and IDSPel17, 
were isolated and characterized from the sheep rumen microbiome. • Both IDSPel16 
and IDSPel17 are alkaline pectate lyases, releasing unsaturated digalacturonate 
and unsaturated trigalacturonate from polygalacturonic acid. • IDSPel16, a 
bifunctional pectate lyase with endo-Pel (EC 4.2.2.2) and exo-Pel (EC 4.2.2.9) 
activities, could be a potential candidate for industrial application."
495,"Long-term use of toxic pesticides in agricultural grounds has led to adverse 
effects on the environment and human health. Microbe-mediated biodegradation of 
pollutants is considered an effective strategy for the removal of contaminants 
in agricultural and environmental sustainability. Imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid 
class of pesticides, was widely applied insecticide in the control of pests in 
agricultural fields including the tea gardens of Assam. Here, native bacteria 
from imidacloprid contaminating tea garden soils were isolated and screened for 
imidacloprid degradation efficiency under laboratory conditions. Out of the 30 
bacterial isolates, 4 were found to tolerate high concentrations of imidacloprid 
(25,000 ppm), one of which isolate MBSB-12 showed the highest efficiency for 
imidacloprid tolerance and utilization as the sole carbon source. Morphological, 
biochemical, and 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing-based characterization 
revealed the isolate as Pseudomonas plecoglossicida MBSB-12. The isolate reduced 
87% of extractable imidacloprid from the treated soil in 90 days compared to the 
control soil (without bacterial treatment). High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry 
(HRMS) analysis indicated imidacloprid breakdown to comparatively less harmful 
products viz., imidacloprid guanidine olefin [m/z = 209.0510 (M + H)+], 
imidacloprid urea [m/z = 212.0502 (M + H)+] and a dechlorinated degraded product 
of imidacloprid with m/z value 175.0900 (M + H)+. Further investigation on the 
molecular machinery of P. plecoglossicida MBSB-12 involved in the degradation of 
imidacloprid is expected to provide a better understanding of the degradation 
pathway."
496,"OBJECTIVE: To identify novel candidate genes whose expression is associated with 
bone mineral density (BMD) and body lean mass (LM) in children.
METHODS: A tissue-specific transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was 
conducted utilizing a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset 
associated with BMD and LM and involving 10,414 participants. The measurement of 
BMD and LM phenotypes was made based on total-body dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (TB-DXA) scans. TWAS was conducted by using FUSION software. 
Reference panels for muscle skeleton (MS), peripheral blood (NBL) and whole 
blood (YBL) were used for TWAS analysis. Functional enrichment and 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses of the genes identified by TWAS were 
performed by using the online tool Metascape ( http://metascape.org ).
RESULTS: For BMD, we identified 174 genes with P < 0.05, such as IKZF1 
(P = 1.46 × 10-9) and CHKB (P = 8.31 × 10-7). For LM, we identified 208 genes 
with P < 0.05, such as COPS5 (P = 3.03 × 10-12) and MRPS33 (P = 5.45 × 10-10). 
Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the BMD-associated genes revealed 200 
GO terms, such as protein catabolic process (Log P = -5.09) and steroid 
hormone-mediated signaling pathway (Log P = -3.13). GO enrichment analysis of 
the LM-associated genes detected 287 GO terms, such as the apoptotic signaling 
pathway (Log P = -8.08) and lipid storage (Log P = -3.55).
CONCLUSION: This study identified several candidate genes for BMD and LM in 
children, providing novel clues to the genetic mechanisms underlying the 
development of childhood BMD and LM."
497,"Peatlands play a crucial role in mediating the emissions of methane through 
active biogeochemical cycling of accumulated carbon driven by 
methane-metabolizing microorganisms; meanwhile, they serve as vital archives of 
atmospheric heavy metal deposition. Despite many edaphic factors confirmed as 
determinants to modulate the structure of methanotrophic and methanogenic 
communities, recognition of interactions among them is limited. In this study, 
peat soils were collected from Dajiuhu peatland to assess the presence of heavy 
metals, and methanotrophs and methanogens were investigated via high-throughput 
sequencing for functional genes mcrA and pmoA. Further analyses of the 
correlations between methane-related functional groups were conducted. The 
results demonstrated that both methane-metabolizing microorganisms and heavy 
metals have prominent vertical heterogeneity upward and downward along the depth 
of 20 cm. Pb, Cd, and Hg strongly correlated with methanotrophs and methanogens 
across all seasons and depths, serving as forceful factors in structural 
variations of methanogenic and methanotrophic communities. Particularly, Pb, Cd, 
and Hg were identified as excessive elements in Dajiuhu peatland. Furthermore, 
seasonal variations of networks among methane-related functional groups and 
environmental factors significantly affected the changes of methane fluxes 
across different seasons. Concretely, the complicated interactions were 
detrimental to methane emissions in the Dajiuhu peatland, leading to the minimum 
methane emissions in winter. Our study identified the key heavy metals affecting 
the composition of methane-metabolizing microorganisms and linkages between 
seasonal variations of methane emissions and interaction among heavy metals and 
methane-metabolizing microorganisms, which provided much new reference and 
theoretical basis for integrated management of natural peatlands."
498,"INTRODUCTION: Serious infections are an important concern for patients with 
autoimmune conditions. We sought to estimate serious infection rates among 
patients with select autoimmune conditions relative to the general population in 
Taiwan and the USA.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study estimated setting-specific standardized 
serious infection incidence rates and ratios among patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus, including extra-renal lupus and lupus nephritis, rheumatoid 
arthritis and primary membranous nephropathy, compared with the general 
population using insurance claims for hospitalizations between 2000 and 2013. 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted 
hazard ratios for serious infections, adjusting for age, sex, index year, prior 
serious infection, comorbidities and medications.
RESULTS: In Taiwan, serious infection rates were 22.7, 28.7, 70.6, 43.4 and 
215.3 per 1000 person-years among the general population and among cohorts 
of patients with primary membranous nephropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, 
extra-renal lupus and lupus nephritis, respectively. In the USA, serious 
infection rates were 2.6, 9.0, 15.6, 21.0 and 63.3 per 1000 person-years among 
the general population and among cohorts of patients with primary membranous 
nephropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, extra-renal lupus and lupus nephritis, 
respectively. Patients had significantly higher serious infection rates than the 
general population in both settings, largely driven by bacterial, respiratory, 
urinary tract and opportunistic infections. Patients with lupus nephritis had 
the highest burden of serious infections relative to the general population, 
with 7- to 25-fold higher adjusted hazard ratios in Taiwan and the USA, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study identified a significant excess serious infection burden 
among patients with targeted autoimmune conditions compared with the general 
populations in Taiwan and the USA."
499,"BACKGROUND: Targeted gene inactivation (TGI) is a widely used technique for the 
study of genes' functions. There are many different methods for TGI, however, 
most of them are so complicated and time-consuming. New promising genetic 
engineering tools are developing for this purpose. In the present study, for the 
first time we disrupted a virulence gene from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi 
(S. Typhi), located in the bacterial chromosome using CRISPR/Cas9 system and 
homology directed repair (HDR).
METHODS: For this aim, pCas9 plasmid containing Cas9 enzyme and required 
proteins for homology directed recombination was transferred to S. Typhi by 
electroporation. On the other hand, a specific guide RNA (gRNA) was designed 
using CRISPOR online tool. Synthetic gRNA was cloned into pTargetF plasmid. 
Also, a DNA fragment (HDR fragment) was designed to incorporate into the 
bacterial chromosome following the cleavage of the bacterial genome by Cas9 
enzyme. pTargetF containing gRNA and HDR fragment were co-transferred to S. 
Typhi containing pcas9 plasmid. The transformed bacteria were screened for 
recombination using PCR, restriction digestion and sequencing.
RESULTS: The results of PCR, restriction digestion and sequencing showed the 
successful recombination of S. Typhi, in which the gidA gene is disrupted.
CONCLUSION: In the present study we aimed to develop a rapid and robust method 
for targeted gene inactivation in a bacterial species, S. Typhi. This procedure 
can be exploited for disruption of other Salmonella as well as other bacteria's 
genes."
500,"Nuclear factor I-C (NFIC) belongs to a family of NFI transcription factors that 
binds to DNA through CAATT-boxes and are involved in cellular differentiation 
and stem cell maintenance. Here we show NFIC protein is significantly 
overexpressed in 69% of acute myeloid leukemia patients. Examination of the 
functional consequences of NFIC overexpression in HSPCs showed that this protein 
promoted monocytic differentiation. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis further 
demonstrated that NFIC overexpressing monocytes had increased expression of 
growth and survival genes. In contrast, depletion of NFIC through shRNA 
decreased cell growth, increased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in AML cell 
lines and AML patient blasts. Further, in AML cell lines (THP-1), bulk RNA 
sequencing of NFIC knockdown led to downregulation of genes involved in cell 
survival and oncogenic signaling pathways including mixed lineage leukemia-1 
(MLL-1). Lastly, we show that NFIC knockdown in an ex vivo mouse MLL::AF9 
pre-leukemic stem cell model, decreased their growth and colony formation and 
increased expression of myeloid differentiation markers Gr1 and Mac1. 
Collectively, our results suggest that NFIC is an important transcription factor 
in myeloid differentiation as well as AML cell survival and is a potential 
therapeutic target in AML."
501,"BACKGROUND: Targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from FFPE specimens is used 
clinically in cancer for its ability to estimate gene expression and to detect 
fusions. Using a cohort of NSCLC patients, we sought to determine whether 
targeted RNA-seq could be used to measure tumour mutational burden (TMB) and the 
expression of immune-cell-restricted genes from FFPE specimens and whether these 
could predict response to immune checkpoint blockade.
METHODS: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas LUAD dataset, we developed a method for 
determining TMB from tumour-only RNA-seq and showed a correlation with DNA 
sequencing derived TMB calculated from tumour/normal sample pairs (Spearman 
correlation = 0.79, 95% CI [0.73, 0.83]. We applied this method to targeted 
sequencing data from our patient cohort and validated these results against TMB 
estimates obtained using an orthogonal assay (Spearman correlation = 0.49, 95% 
CI [0.24, 0.68]).
RESULTS: We observed that the RNA measure of TMB was significantly higher in 
responders to immune blockade treatment (P = 0.028) and that it was predictive 
of response (AUC = 0.640 with 95% CI [0.493, 0.786]). By contrast, the 
expression of immune-cell-restricted genes was uncorrelated with patient 
outcome.
CONCLUSION: TMB calculated from targeted RNA sequencing has a similar diagnostic 
ability to TMB generated from targeted DNA sequencing."
502,"Multiple heavy metal contamination is an increasingly common global problem. 
Heavy metals have the potential to disrupt microbially mediated biogeochemical 
cycling. However, systems-level studies on the effects of combinations of heavy 
metals on bacteria are lacking. For this study, we focused on the Oak Ridge 
Reservation (ORR; Oak Ridge, TN, USA) subsurface which is contaminated with 
several heavy metals and high concentrations of nitrate. Using a native Bacillus 
cereus isolate that represents a dominant species at this site, we assessed the 
combined impact of eight metal contaminants, all at site-relevant 
concentrations, on cell processes through an integrated multi-omics approach 
that included discovery proteomics, targeted metabolomics, and targeted 
gene-expression profiling. The combination of eight metals impacted cell 
physiology in a manner that could not have been predicted from summing 
phenotypic responses to the individual metals. Exposure to the metal mixture 
elicited a global iron starvation response not observed during individual metal 
exposures. This disruption of iron homeostasis resulted in decreased activity of 
the iron-cofactor-containing nitrate and nitrite reductases, both of which are 
important in biological nitrate removal at the site. We propose that the 
combinatorial effects of simultaneous exposure to multiple heavy metals is an 
underappreciated yet significant form of cell stress in the environment with the 
potential to disrupt global nutrient cycles and to impede bioremediation efforts 
at mixed waste sites. Our work underscores the need to shift from single- to 
multi-metal studies for assessing and predicting the impacts of complex 
contaminants on microbial systems."
503,"Like the ability of a fox to avoid the same snare twice, the plant Arabidopsis 
thaliana seems to be able to respond differently to an event it has previously 
encountered. Shrewdness is no surprising characteristic of a fox, but the 
comparison does invite the question: do plants possess memory? In this edition 
of Physiologia Plantarum, the article by Vyse et al. (2022) describes how 
Arabidopsis responds differently to cold-stress, when encountering it for the 
first time (priming) and to a second similar stress after a memory phase 
(triggering). Arabidopsis seems to perceive the stress after triggering as a 
milder one and the authors postulate that the memory of the first occurrence of 
the stress reduces the amount of resources needed to cope with the cold-stress a 
second time."
504,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) show high efficiency in a small fraction of 
advanced gastric cancer (GC). However, personalized immune subtypes have not 
been developed for the prediction of ICI efficiency in GC. Herein, we identified 
Pan-Immune Activation Module (PIAM), a curated gene expression profile (GEP) 
representing the co-infiltration of multiple immune cell types in tumor 
microenvironment of GC, which was associated with high expression of 
immunosuppressive molecules such as PD-1 and CTLA-4. We also identified 
Pan-Immune Dysfunction Genes (PIDG), a conservative PIAM-derivated GEP 
indicating the dysfunction of immune cell cooperation, which was associated with 
upregulation of metastatic programs (extracellular matrix receptor interaction, 
TGF-β signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and calcium signaling) but 
downregulation of proliferative signalings (MYC targets, E2F targets, mTORC1 
signaling, and DNA replication and repair). Moreover, we developed 
'GSClassifier', an ensemble toolkit based on top scoring pairs and extreme 
gradient boosting, for population-based modeling and personalized identification 
of GEP subtypes. With PIAM and PIDG, we developed four Pan-immune Activation and 
Dysfunction (PAD) subtypes and a GSClassifier model 'PAD for individual' with 
high accuracy in predicting response to pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in advance GC 
(AUC = 0.833). Intriguingly, PAD-II (PIAMhighPIDGlow) displayed the highest 
objective response rate (60.0%) compared with other subtypes (PAD-I, 
PIAMhighPIDGhigh, 0%; PAD-III, PIAMlowPIDGhigh, 0%; PAD-IV, PIAMlowPIDGlow, 
17.6%; P = 0.003), which was further validated in the metastatic urothelial 
cancer cohort treated with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) (P = 0.018). In all, we 
provided 'GSClassifier' as a refined computational framework for GEP-based 
stratification and PAD subtypes as a promising strategy for exploring ICI 
responders in GC. Metastatic pathways could be potential targets for GC patients 
with high immune infiltration but resistance to ICI therapy."
505,"OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of Doublesex and mab-3-related transcription 
factor 1 (DMRT1) gene variants on the encoded protein's function and the 
variants' pathogenic relevance for isolated male infertility caused by 
azoospermia.
DESIGN: This study established a novel luciferase assay for DMRT1 missense 
variants using 2 different target promotors and validated the assay by analyzing 
previously published variants associated with differences in sex development.
SETTING: University genetics research institute and tertiary referral center for 
couples' infertility.
PATIENT(S): Eleven infertile men with severely impaired spermatogenesis 
resulting in crypto- or azoospermia and carrying rare heterozygous missense 
variants in DMRT1 were identified within the Male Reproductive Genomics study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Luciferase assays with human DMRT1 variants to test 
functional effects on the CYP19A1 and Stra8 target promoters.
RESULT(S): We first developed and refined luciferase assays to reliably test the 
functional impact of DMRT1 missense variants. Next, the assay was validated by 
analyzing 2 DMRT1 variants associated with differences in sex development, of 
which c.240G>C p.(Arg80Ser) displayed highly significant effects on both target 
promoters compared with the wild-type protein (-40% and +100%, respectively) and 
c.331A>G p.(Arg111Gly) had a significant effect on the Stra8 promoter (-76%). We 
then systematically characterized 11 DMRT1 variants identified in infertile men. 
The de novo variant c.344T>A p.(Met115Lys) showed a pronounced loss of function 
in both DMRT1 target promoters (-100% and -86%, respectively). Variants c.308A>G 
p.(Lys103Arg) and c.991G>C p.(Asp331His) showed a significant gain of function 
exclusively for the CYP19A1 promoter (+15% and +19%, respectively). Based on 
these results, 3 variants were reclassified according to clinical guidelines.
CONCLUSION(S): The present study highlights the importance of functionally 
characterizing DMRT1 variants of uncertain clinical significance. Using 
luciferase assays for diagnostic purposes enables an improved causal diagnosis 
for isolated male infertility."
506,"The ε4 variant of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest and most common 
genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the mechanism of 
conveyed risk is incompletely understood, promotion of inflammation, 
dysregulated metabolism, and protein misfolding and aggregation are contributors 
to accelerating disease. Here we determined the concurrent effects of systemic 
metabolic changes and brain inflammation in young (3-month-old) and aged 
(18-month-old) male and female mice carrying the APOE4 gene. Using functional 
metabolic assays alongside multivariate modeling of hippocampal cytokine levels, 
we found that brain cytokine signatures are predictive of systemic metabolic 
outcomes, independent of AD proteinopathies. Male and female mice each produce 
different cytokine signatures as they age and as their systemic metabolic 
phenotype declines, and these signatures are APOE genotype dependent. Ours is 
the first study to identify a quantitative and predictive link between systemic 
metabolism and specific pathological cytokine signatures in the brain. Our 
results highlight the effects of APOE4 beyond the brain and suggest the 
potential for bi-directional influence of risk factors in the brain and 
periphery."
507,"Menopause is not only the end of reproductive life, it is also related to 
diseases such as hyperlipidaemia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 
osteoporosis and breast cancer. Traditional epidemiological studies have found 
that heredity is the main determinant of age at natural menopause (ANM). Early 
studies on genetic factors were limited to candidate gene studies. Menopause age 
is not inherited by a single gene, but is the result of multiple gene effects. 
With the development of genomic technology, the Reproductive Genetics Consortium 
conducted several genome-wide association studies on ANM in people of European 
descent, and found that defects in DNA damage repair pathways were the main 
genetic mechanism. In recent years, due to the ethnic heterogeneity of ANM, 
there has been further development of global studies into multi-ethnic and 
trans-ethnic genome-wide association studies. Further genetic and 
epidemiological studies, including polygenetic score and genetic mechanism 
research, should be conducted to investigate the pathogenesis and mechanism with 
respect to menopause and its related diseases."
508,"Exogenous polyamines are able to induce life span and improve glucose 
homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. However, the effects of exogenous 
polyamines on adipocyte differentiation and which polyamine transporters mediate 
them have not been elucidated yet. Here, we identified for the first time that 
exogenous polyamines can clearly stimulate adipocyte differentiation through 
polyamine transporters, solute carrier family 3 member A2 (SLC3A2) and SLC7A1. 
Exogenous polyamines markedly promote 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation by 
increasing the intracellular lipid accumulation and the expression of both 
adipogenic and lipogenic genes in a concentration-dependent manner. In 
particular, exogenous putrescine mainly regulates adipocyte differentiation in 
the early and intermediate stages. Moreover, we have assessed the expression of 
polyamine transporter genes in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes. 
Interestingly, the putrescine-induced adipocyte differentiation was found to be 
significantly suppressed in response to a treatment with a polyamine transporter 
inhibitor (AMXT-1501). Furthermore, knockdown experiments using siRNA that 
specifically targeted SLC3A2 or SLC7A2, revealed that both SLC3A2 and SLC7A2 act 
as important transporters in the cellular importing of exogenous putrescine. 
Thus, the exogenous putrescine entering the adipocytes via cellular transporters 
is involved in adipogenesis through a modulation of both the mitotic clonal 
expansion and the expression of master transcription factors. Taken together, 
these results suggest that exogenous polyamines (such as putrescine) entering 
the adipocytes through polyamine transporters, can stimulate adipogenesis."
509,"Liver cancer has a high prevalence, with majority of the cases presenting as 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prognosis of metastatic HCC has hardly 
improved over the past decade, highlighting the necessity for liver cancer 
research. Studies have reported the ability of the KiSS1 gene to inhibit the 
growth or metastasis of liver cancer, but contradictory research results are 
also emerging. We, therefore, sought to investigate the effects of KiSS1 on 
growth and migration in human HCC cells. HepG2 human HCC cells were infected 
with lentivirus particles containing KiSS1. The overexpression of KiSS1 resulted 
in an increased proliferation rate of HCC cells. Quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction and immunoblotting revealed increased Akt activity, and downregulation 
of the G1/S phase cell cycle inhibitors. A significant increase in tumor 
spheroid formation with upregulation of β-catenin and CD133 was also observed. 
KiSS1 overexpression promoted the migratory, invasive ability, and metastatic 
capacity of the hepatocarcinoma cell line, and these effects were associated 
with changes in the expressions of epithelial mesenchymal transition 
(EMT)-related genes such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and slug. KiSS1 
overexpression also resulted in dramatically increased tumor growth in the 
xenograft mouse model, and upregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen 
(PCNA) and Ki-67 in the HCC tumors. Furthermore, KiSS1 increased the angiogenic 
capacity by upregulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) 
and CD31. Based on these observations, we infer that KiSS1 not only induces HCC 
proliferation, but also increases the metastatic potential by increasing the 
migratory ability and angiogenic capacity."
510,"Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) have great 
potential in applications such as regenerative medicine, cardiac disease 
modeling, and in vitro drug evaluation. However, hPSC-CMs are immature, which 
limits their applications. During development, the maturation of CMs is 
accompanied by a decline in their proliferative capacity. This phenomenon 
suggests that regulating the cell cycle may facilitate the maturation of 
hPSC-CMs. Aurora kinases are essential kinases that regulate the cell cycle, the 
role of which is not well studied in hPSC-CM maturation. Here, we demonstrate 
that CYC116, an inhibitor of Aurora kinases, significantly promotes the 
maturation of CMs derived from both human embryonic stem cells (H1 and H9) and 
iPSCs (induced PSCs) (UC013), resulting in increased expression of genes related 
to cardiomyocyte function, better organization of the sarcomere, increased 
sarcomere length, increased number of mitochondria, and enhanced physiological 
function of the cells. In addition, a number of other Aurora kinase inhibitors 
have also been found to promote the maturation of hPSC-CMs. Our data suggest 
that blocking aurora kinase activity and regulating cell cycle progression may 
promote the maturation of hPSC-CMs."
511,"It has recently been proposed that lower mutation rates in gene bodies compared 
with upstream and downstream sequences in Arabidopsis thaliana are the result of 
an ""adaptive"" modification of the rate of beneficial and deleterious mutations 
in these functional regions. This claim was based both on analyses of mutation 
accumulation lines and on population genomics data. Here we show that several 
questionable assumptions were used in the population genomics analyses. In 
particular, we demonstrate that the difference between gene bodies and less 
selectively constrained sequences in the magnitude of Tajima's D can in 
principle be explained by the presence of sites subject to purifying selection, 
and does not require lower mutation rates in regions experiencing selective 
constraints."

513,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created 
a public health emergency globally. SARS-CoV-2 enters the human cell through the 
binding of the spike protein to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
receptor. Significant changes have been reported in the mutational landscape of 
SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S protein, subsequent to 
evolution of the pandemic. The present study examines the correlation between 
the binding affinity of mutated S-proteins and the rate of viral infectivity. 
For this, the binding affinity of SARS-CoV and variants of SARS-CoV-2 towards 
ACE2 was computationally determined. Subsequently, the RBD mutations were 
classified on the basis of the number of strains identified with respect to each 
mutation and the resulting variation in the binding affinity was computationally 
examined. The molecular docking studies indicated a significant correlation 
between the Z-Rank score of mutated S proteins and the rate of infectivity, 
suitable for predicting SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Accordingly, a 30-mer peptide 
was designed and the inhibitory properties were computationally analyzed. Single 
amino acid-wise mutation was performed subsequently to identify the peptide with 
the highest binding affinity. Molecular dynamics and free energy calculations 
were then performed to examine the stability of the peptide-protein complexes. 
Additionally, selected peptides were synthesized and screened using a 
colorimetric assay. Together, this study developed a model to predict the rate 
of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 variants and propose a potential peptide that can 
be used as an inhibitor for the viral entry to human.Communicated by Ramaswamy

514,"Lung cancer is a severe health problem that affects more men than women around 
the world. The goal of this study was to identify the biomarker hub genes for 
lung cancer in order to ascertain the biological pathway and protein- protein 
interaction networks. The microarray datasets GSE80796, GSE68571, GSE118370 and 
GSE43458 were retrieved from the GEO database and were analysed using GEO2R. 
STRING, Cytoscape, and cytoHubba were used to construct the PPI network and hub 
genes. GEPIA was used to obtain the overall survival and expression level in 
LUAD/LUSC and normal tissue. The MTT assay was used to examine antiproliferative 
activity. PI staining was used to determine the cell cycle arrest. qPCR was used 
to analyse gene expressions. The datasets revealed a total of 401 common DEGs, 
with 258 up-regulated genes and 143 down-regulated genes. Further, in-vitro 
study of gallic acid cytotoxic effect in human lung cancer cell line A549 
indicated that gallic acid dramatically suppressed cell growth in A549 cells. 
Gallic acid also, significantly promoted programmed cell death by halting cells 
in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Taken together, our study indicated that 
gallic acid is a promising natural STAT1 inhibitor as it hindered lung cancer 
progression by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis which can be employed to 
increase the therapeutic efficacy of existing lung cancer treatments and to 
improve overall patient survival.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma."
515,"The metabolism of tomato fruits changes when plants experience drought stress. 
In this study, we investigated changes in microRNA abundance and detected 32 
miRNA (microRNA)s whose expression changes in fruit. The candidate target genes 
for each miRNA were predicted from the differentially expressed genes identified 
by transcriptome analysis at the same fruit maturation stage. The predicted 
targeted genes were related to cell wall metabolisms, response to pathogens, and 
plant hormone. Among these, we focused on cell-wall metabolism related genes and 
performed a dual luciferase assay to assess the targeting of their mRNAs by 
their predicted miRNA. As a result, sly-miR10532 and sly-miR7981e suppress the 
expression of mRNAs of galacturonosyltransferase-10 like encoding the main 
enzyme of pectin biosynthesis, while sly-miR171b-5p targets β-1,3-glucosidase 
mRNAs involved in glucan degradation. These results will allow the systematic 
characterization of miRNA and their target genes in tomato fruit under drought 
stress condition."
516,"In this study, we employed a reporter-guided mutation selection (RGMS) strategy 
to improve the rimocidin production of Streptomyces rimosus M527, which is based 
on a single-reporter plasmid pAN and atmospheric and room temperature plasma 
(ARTP). In plasmid pAN, PrimA, a native promoter of the loading module of 
rimocidin biosynthesis (RimA) was chosen as target, and the kanamycin resistance 
gene (neo) under the control of PrimA was chosen as reporter gene. The 
integrative plasmid pAN was introduced into the chromosome of S. rimosus M527 by 
conjugation to yield the initial strain S. rimosus M527-pAN. Subsequently, 
mutants of M527-pAN were generated by ARTP. Seventy-nine mutants were obtained 
in total, of which sixty-seven mutants showed higher level of kanamycin 
resistance (Kanr) than that of the initial strain M527-pAN. The majority of 
mutants exhibited a slight increase in rimocidin production compared to 
M527-pAN. Notably, three mutants, M527-pAN-S34, S38, and S52, which exhibited 
highest kanamycin resistance among all Kanr mutants, showed 34%, 52% and 45% 
increase in rimocidin production compared to M527-pAN, respectively. 
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the transcriptional levels of neo and 
rim genes were increased in mutants M527-pAN-S34, S38, and S52 compared to 
M527-pAN. These results confirmed that the RGMS approach was successful in 
improving the rimocidin production in S. rimosus M527."
517,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common autosomal codominant hereditary 
illness marked by the heightened risk of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease and high blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). FH 
patients can have homozygous or heterozygous variants. This condition has been 
linked to variations in the genes for the LDL receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B, 
proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin 9 (PCSK9), and LDLR adaptor protein 1. 
Drugs such as statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors are currently widely 
available, allowing for the theoretical normalization of plasma LDL-C levels 
mostly in patients with heterozygous FH. However, homozygous FH patients usually 
have a poor response to traditional lipid-lowering therapy and may have a poor 
prognosis at a young age. LDL apheresis and novel pharmacological therapies such 
as microsomal transfer protein inhibitors or anti-angiopoietin-like protein 3 
monoclonal antibodies are extremely expensive and unavailable in most regions of 
the world. Therefore, the unmet need persists for these patients. In this 
review, we discuss the numerous gene delivery, gene editing, and stem cell 
manipulation techniques used in this study to correct FH-causing LDLR gene 
variations in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Finally, we looked at a variety of 
studies that corrected genetic defects that caused FH using the ground-breaking 
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats

518,"In this study we investigated the effects of a neonatal handling protocol that 
mimics the handling of sham control pups in protocols of neonatal exposure to 
brain insults on dendritic arborization and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels in 
the developing brain. GAGs are long, unbranched polysaccharides, consisting of 
repeating disaccharide units that can be modified by sulfation at specific sites 
and are involved in modulating neuronal plasticity during brain development. In 
this study, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent neonatal handling 
daily between post-natal day (PD)4 and PD9, with brains analyzed on PD9. 
Neuronal morphology and morphometric analysis of the apical and basal dendritic 
trees of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons were carried out by Golgi-Cox 
staining followed by neuron tracing and analysis with the software Neurolucida. 
Chondroitin sulfate (CS)-, Hyaluronic Acid (HA)-, and Heparan Sulfate (HS)-GAG 
disaccharide levels were quantified in the hippocampus by Liquid 
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry analyses. We found sex by neonatal handling 
interactions on several parameters of CA1 pyramidal neuron morphology and in the 
levels of HS-GAGs, with females, but not males, showing an increase in both 
dendritic arborization and HS-GAG levels. We also observed increased expression 
of glucocorticoid receptor gene Nr3c1 in the hippocampus of both males and 
females following neonatal handling suggesting that both sexes experienced a 
similar stress during the handling procedure. This is the first study to show 
sex differences in two parameters of brain plasticity, CA1 neuron morphology and 
HS-GAG levels, following handling stress in neonatal rats."
519,"BACKGROUND: Asthma and obesity are both complex conditions characterized by 
chronic inflammation, and obesity-related severe asthma has been associated with 
differences in the microbiome. However, whether the airway microbiome and 
microbiota-immune response relationships differ between obese persons with or 
without non-severe asthma is unestablished.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the airway microbiome and microbiota-immune mediator 
relationships between obese and non-obese subjects, with and without 
mild-moderate asthma.
METHODS: We performed cross-sectional analyses of the airway (induced sputum) 
microbiome and cytokine profiles from blood and sputum, employing 16S rRNA gene 
and ITS region sequencing to profile bacteria and fungi, and multiplex 
immunoassays. Analysis tools included QIIME2, linear discriminant analysis 
effect size (LEfSe), Piphillin, and SParse InversE Covariance Estimation for 
Ecological Association Inference (SPIEC-EASI).
RESULTS: Obesity, irrespective of asthma status, was associated with significant 
differences in sputum bacterial community structure and composition (unweighted 
Unifrac PERMANOVA, p=0.02), including a higher relative abundance of Prevotella, 
Gemella, and Streptococcus species. Among asthmatic subjects, additional 
differences in sputum bacterial composition and fungal richness were identified 
between obese and non-obese individuals. Correlation network analyses 
demonstrated differences between obese and non-obese asthma in relationships 
between cytokine mediators, and these together with specific airway bacteria, 
involving blood PAI-1, sputum IL1-β, GM-CSF, IL-8, TNF-α, and several Prevotella 
species.
CONCLUSION: Obesity itself is associated with an altered sputum microbiome, 
which further differs in those with mild-moderate asthma. The distinct 
differences in airway microbiota and immune marker relationships in obese asthma 
suggest potential involvement of airway microbes that may impact mechanisms or 
outcomes of obese asthma."
520,"Genome-scale target identification promises to guide microbial cell factory 
engineering for higher-titer production of biomolecules such as recombinant 
proteins (r-protein), but challenges remain due to the need not only for 
comprehensive genotypic perturbation but also in conjunction with 
high-throughput phenotypic screening strategies. Here, we developed a 
CRISPRi-microfluidics screening platform to systematically identify crucial gene 
targets that can be engineered to enhance r-protein secretion in Corynebacterium 
glutamicum. We created a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library containing 46,549 
single-guide RNAs, where we aimed to unbiasedly target all genes for repression. 
Meanwhile, we developed a highly efficient droplet-based microfluidics system 
integrating the FlAsH-tetracysteine assay that enables screening of millions of 
strains to identify potential knockdowns conducive to nanobody VHH secretion. 
Among our highest-ranking candidates are a slew of previously unknown targets 
involved in transmembrane transport, amino-acid metabolism and redox regulation. 
Guided by these findings, we eventually constructed a hyperproducer for multiple 
proteins via combinatorial engineering of redox-response transcription factors. 
As the near-universal applicability of CRISPRi technology and the FlAsH-based 
screening platform, this procedure might be expanded to include a varied variety 
of microbial species and recombinant proteins."
521,"Seawater rice has been cultivated to ensure food security. The salt-tolerant 
rice strains are resistant to saline and alkali but may be vulnerable to 
elevated arsenic (As) near coastal regions. Herein, the saline-alkaline paddy 
soil was incubated with natural irrigation river for three months to explore the 
mobility and transformation of As. The incubation results showed that 65 ± 1.2 % 
solid-bound As(V) was reduced to As(III) within two weeks with the release of 
As(III) to porewater. The dissolved As(III) was methylated after two weeks, 
resulting in dimethyl arsenate (DMA) as the dominant As species (87 %-100 %). 
The elevated As methylation was attributed to the most abundant arsenite 
methyltransferase gene (arsM) (4.1-10.4 × 107/g dry soil), over three orders of 
magnitude higher than As redox-related genes. The analysis of arsM operational 
taxonomic units (OTUs) suggested the highest sequence similarity to 
Proteobacteria (25.7-39.5 %), Actinobacteria (24.9-30.5 %), Gemmatimonadetes 
(7.5-11.9 %), Basidiomycota (5.1-12.5 %), and Chloroflexi (4.1-8.7 %). 
Specifically, Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria are salt-tolerant bacteria, 
probably responsible for As methylation. The As in grain was within a safe 
regulatory level, and the dominance of methylated As in porewater did not 
enhance its accumulation in rice grains."
522,"Circadian disturbance brought on by shift employment, nighttime light pollution, 
and other factors is quite prevalent in contemporary culture. However, the 
effect of maternal circadian disruption before pregnancy on the reproduction of 
offspring in mice requires further research. Herein, we exposed female ICR mice 
to constant light to establish a model of preconceptional circadian disruption 
and then checked the ovarian function of female offspring (named the CLE group 
below). Our results revealed obesity, abnormal lipid metabolism and earlier 
puberty onset in the CLE group. Additionally, impaired ovarian follicle 
development, oocyte quality and preimplantation embryo development were shown in 
the CLE group. Moreover, the expression levels of Gnrh1 in the hypothalamus and 
Cyp17a1, Bmper, Bdnf and Lyve1 in ovaries, as well as circadian clock genes, 
including Clock, Cry1, Nr1d2 and Per2, were significantly downregulated in the 
CLE group. Mechanistically, immune responses, including the interleukin-17

chemokine signalling pathway, were altered in the CLE group, which may be 
responsible for the damaged ovarian function."

vannamei) under intensive aquaculture. The GBE0 (control group), GBE1, GBE2, and 
GBE4 groups were fed a commercial feed supplemented with 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 
g/kg GBE for 21 days, respectively. The results showed that dietary GBE could 
alleviate hepatopancreas tissue damage and improve the survival rate of shrimp, 
and dietary 2 g/kg GBE could significantly increase the total hemocyte count 
(THC), the hemocyanin content, the antioxidant gene's expression, and the 
activity of their encoded enzymes in P. vannamei. Furthermore, transcriptome 
data revealed that immunity-related genes were upregulated in the GBE2 group 
compared with the GBE0 group after 21 days of culture. Drug 
metabolism-cytochrome P450, sphingolipid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, 
glycerolipid metabolism, fat digestion and protein digestion and absorption 
pathways were significantly enriched, according to KEGG results. Surprisingly, 
all of the above KEGG-enriched pathways were significantly upregulated. These 
findings demonstrated that supplementing P. vannamei with 2 g/kg GBE improved 
its environmental adaptability by improving immunity, lipid metabolism, and 
detoxification. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of 
dietary GBE on the intensive aquaculture of P. vannamei was conducted to provide 
a reference for the healthy culture of P. vannamei."
524,"Lysosomes are specialized organelles with an acidic pH that act as recycling 
hubs for intracellular and extracellular components. They harbour numerous 
different hydrolytic enzymes to degrade substrates like proteins, peptides, and 
glycolipids. Reduced catalytic activity of lysosomal enzymes can cause the 
accumulation of these substrates and loss of lysosomal integrity, resulting in 
lysosomal dysfunction and lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). Post-mitotic 
cells, such as neurons, seem to be highly sensitive to damages induced by 
lysosomal dysfunction, thus LSDs often manifest with neurological symptoms. 
Interestingly, some LSDs and Parkinson's disease (PD) share common cellular 
pathomechanisms, suggesting convergence of aetiology of the two disease types. 
This is further underlined by genetic associations of several lysosomal genes 
involved in LSDs with PD. The increasing number of lysosome-associated genetic 
risk factors for PD makes it necessary to understand functions and interactions 
of lysosomal proteins/enzymes both in healthy and disease states, thereby 
holding the potential to identify new therapeutic targets. In this review, we 
highlight genetic and mechanistic interactions between the complex lysosomal 
network, LSDs and PD, and elaborate on methodical challenges in lysosomal 
research."
525,"Zika virus (ZIKV), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, causes congenital 
ZIKV syndrome in children and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) in adults. ZIKV 
expresses nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), a large protein that is essential for 
viral replication. ZIKV NS5 confers the ability to evade interferon (IFN) 
signalling; however, the exact mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we 
employed affinity pull-down and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) analyses and found that splicing factor 3b subunit 3 (SF3B3) is 
associated with the NS5-Flag pull-down complex through interaction with NS5. 
Functional assays showed that SF3B3 overexpression inhibited ZIKV replication by 
promoting IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression whereas silencing of SF3B3 
inhibited expression of ISGs to promote ZIKV replication. GTP cyclohydrolase I 
(GCH1) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) 
biosynthesis. NS5 upregulates the expression of GCH1 during ZIKV infection. And 
GCH1 marginally promoted ZIKV replication via the IFN pathway. Additionally, 
GCH1 expression is related to the regulation of SF3B3. Overexpression of the 
SF3B3 protein effectively reduced GCH1 protein levels, whereas SF3B3 knockdown 
increased its levels. These findings indicated that ZIKV NS5 binding protein 
SF3B3 contributed to the host immune response against ZIKV replication by 
modulating the expression of GCH1."
526,"Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and leading cause 
of infant mortality, yet molecular mechanisms explaining CHD remain mostly 
unknown. Sequencing studies are identifying CHD candidate genes at a brisk rate 
including MINK1, a serine/threonine kinase. However, a plausible molecular 
mechanism connecting CHD and MINK1 is unknown. Here, we reveal that mink1 is 
required for proper heart development due to its role in left-right patterning. 
Mink1 regulates canonical Wnt signaling to define the cell fates of the Spemann 
Organizer and the Left-Right Organizer, a ciliated structure that breaks 
bilateral symmetry in the vertebrate embryo. To identify Mink1 targets, we 
applied an unbiased proteomics approach and identified the high mobility group 
architectural transcription factor, Hmga2. We report that Hmga2 is necessary and 
sufficient for regulating Spemann's Organizer. Indeed, we demonstrate that Hmga2 
can induce Spemann Organizer cell fates even when β-catenin, a critical effector 
of the Wnt signaling pathway, is depleted. In summary, we discover a 
transcription factor, Hmga2, downstream of Mink1 that is critical for the 
regulation of Spemann's Organizer, as well as the LRO, defining a plausible 
mechanism for CHD."
527,"AIM: To determine Streptococcus agalactiae genes responsible for causing 
neonatal meningitis.
BACKGROUND: Streptococcus agalactiae strain 2603 V/R is causative agent of 
neonatal meningitis, maternal infection and sepsis in young children. World 
health organisation reported high burden of new born death caused by this 
bacterium. Streptococcus agalactiae colonizing epithelial cells of vagina and 
endothelial cells have high resistance to available antibiotic drugs which makes 
it essential to determine new drug targets.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the genome of selected strain with the non-pathogenic 
strains of streptococcus and identify the virulent and antibiotic resistant 
genes for adaptation in host environment.
METHOD: The whole genome of human pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae strain 
2603 V/R was analysed and compared with Streptococcus dysgalactiae strains using 
visualization and annotation tools. Genomic islands, mobile genetic elements, 
virulent and resistant genes were studied.
RESULTS: Genetically pathogenic strain is most similar to Streptococcus 
dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain NCTC 7136. Comparative analysis revealed 
the importance of capsular polysaccharides and surface proteins responsible for 
avoiding immune system attachment to host epithelial cells and virulent 
behaviour. High number of genes coding for antibiotics resistance may provide a 
competitive advantage for survival of pathogenic Streptococcus agalactiae strain 
2603 V/R in its niche.
CONCLUSIONS: The comparative analysis of pathogenic strain Streptococcus 
agalactiae with non-pathogenic strains of Streptococcus dysgalactiae provided 
new insights in pathogenicity that could aid in recognization for new regions 
and genes for development of new drug development strategies considering 
presence of high number of resistance genes."
528,"Endurance training in fasted conditions (FAST) induces favorable skeletal muscle 
metabolic adaptations compared with carbohydrate feeding (CHO), manifesting in 
improved exercise performance over time. Sprint interval training (SIT) is a 
potent metabolic stimulus, however nutritional strategies to optimize 
adaptations to SIT are poorly characterized. Here we investigated the efficacy 
of FAST versus CHO SIT (4-6 × 30-s Wingate sprints interspersed with 4-min rest) 
on muscle metabolic, serum metabolome and exercise performance adaptations in a 
double-blind parallel group design in recreationally active males. Following 
acute SIT, we observed exercise-induced increases in pan-acetylation and several 
genes associated with mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and 
NAD+-biosynthesis, along with favorable regulation of PDK4 (p = .004), NAMPT (p 
= .0013), and NNMT (p = .001) in FAST. Following 3 weeks of SIT, NRF2 (p = .029) 
was favorably regulated in FAST, with augmented pan-acetylation in CHO but not 
FAST (p = .033). SIT induced increases in maximal citrate synthase activity were 
evident with no effect of nutrition, while 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase 
activity did not change. Despite no difference in the overall serum metabolome, 
training-induced changes in C3:1 (p = .013) and C4:1 (p = .010) which increased 
in FAST, and C16:1 (p = .046) and glutamine (p = .021) which increased in CHO, 
were different between groups. Training-induced increases in anaerobic (p = 
.898) and aerobic power (p = .249) were not influenced by nutrition. These 
findings suggest some beneficial muscle metabolic adaptations are evident in 
FAST versus CHO SIT following acute exercise and 3 weeks of SIT. However, this 
stimulus did not manifest in differential exercise performance adaptations."
529,"Woody breast has become a considerable economic concern to the poultry industry. 
This myopathy presents rigid, pale breasts characterized by replacement of lean 
muscle protein with connective tissue, a result of hypoxia and oxidative stress 
in a metabolically starved muscle with inadequate circulation. Hence, the 
objectives were to supplement broiler diets with ingredients specifically aimed 
to improve circulation and oxidative status. About 1,344 male Ross 708 broilers 
were assigned to 1 of 4 diets: 1) a basal diet (control), 2) basal diet plus a 
blend of 0.2% supplemental L-arginine, 0.17% choline bitartrate, and 0.03% 
vitamin C (blend), 3) 0.1% vasodilator ingredient (vasodilator), or 4) 0.02% 
Astaxanthin ingredient (AsX). At d 14, 28, 42, and 49, performance outcomes were 
collected on all birds and serum from 16 broilers/diet (n = 64) was analyzed for 
creatine kinase and myoglobin. Once weekly beginning on d 28, a subset of 192 
broilers were measured for breast width. On d 42 and 49, breast fillets from 16 
broilers/diet (n = 64) were palpated for woody breast severity, weighed, and 
analyzed for compression force at 1-day postmortem and water-holding capacity at 
2-day postmortem. mRNA was isolated from 15 breast fillets/timepoint for qPCR 
quantification of myogenic gene expression. Data were analyzed using Proc Mixed 
(SAS Version 9.4) with the fixed effect of diet. Feed conversion ratio was 
improved in the blend and vasodilator-fed birds d 42 to 49, each by over 2 
points (P < 0.05). Breast width was increased in the control on d 42 compared to 
the vasodilator and AsX-fed broilers (P < 0.05). At d 42, there were 12% greater 
normal fillets in blend diet-fed birds and 13% more normal scores in 
vasodilator-fed birds at d 49 compared to the control. At d 49, myogenin 
expression was upregulated in the AsX diet compared to blend and control diets 
(P < 0.05), and muscle regulatory factor-4 expression was increased by 6.5% in 
the vasodilator diet compared to the blend and AsX diets (P < 0.05). Blend and 
vasodilator diets simultaneously improved feed efficiency in birds approaching 
market weight while reducing woody breast severity."
530,"The insulin-induced genes (INSIG1 and INSIG2) have been demonstrated to play a 
vital role in regulating lipid metabolism in mammals, however the function and 
regulation mechanism of them remains unknown in poultry. In this study, firstly 
the phylogenetic trees of INSIGs among various species were constructed and 
their subcellular locations were mapped in chicken LMH. Then the spatiotemporal 
expression profiles, over-expression and knockdown assays of chicken INSIGs were 
conducted. Furthermore, conservation of potential miRNA binding sites in INSIGs 
among species were analyzed, and the miRNA biological function and regulatory 
role were verified. The results showed that chicken INSIGs located in cellular 
endoplasmic reticulum, and were originated from the common ancestors of their 
mammalian counterparts. The INSIGs were widely expressed in all detected 
tissues, and their expression levels in the liver of chicken at 30 wk were 
significantly higher than that at 20 wk (P < 0.01). Over-expression of INSIGs 
led no significant increase in mRNA abundance of lipid metabolism-related genes 
and the contents of triacylglycerol (TG) and cholesterol (TC) in LMH cells. 
Knockdown of INSIG1 led to the decreased expressions of ACSL1, MTTP-L, ApoB, 
ApoVLDLII genes and TG, TC contents (P < 0.05). Knockdown of INSIG2 could 
significantly decrease the contents of TG and TC, and expressions of key genes 
related to the lipid metabolism (P < 0.05). Moreover, INSIG1 was directly 
targeted by both miR-130b-3p and miR-218-5p, and INSIG2 was directly targeted by 
miR-130b-3p. MiR-130b-3p mimic and miR-218-5p mimic treatment could significant 
decrease the mRNA and protein levels of INSIGs, mRNA levels of genes related to 
lipid metabolism, and the contents of TG and TC in LMH cells. The inhibition of 
miR-130b-3p and miR-218-5p on TG and TC contents could be restored by the 
overexpression of INSIGs, respectively. No significant alteration in expressions 
of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBPs) and SREBP 
cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) were observed when INSIGs were 
over-expressed. SCAP was down-regulated when INSIG1 was knocked down, while 
SREBP1 was down-regulated when INSIG2 was knocked down. Taken together, these 
results highlight the role of INSIG1 and INSIG2 in lipid metabolism and their 
regulatory mechanism in chicken."
531,"Ergothioneine (ERG) is an unusual sulfur-containing amino acid with antioxidant 
activity that can be synthesized by certain bacteria and fungi. Microbial 
fermentation is a promising method for ERG production. In this study, the 
bifunctional enzyme methyltransferase-sulfoxide synthase NcEgt1 from Neurospora 
crassa was truncated to obtain sulfoxide synthase TNcEgt1, which showed a higher 
expression level in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Then, the genes egtD encoding 
methyltransferase EgtD and egtE encoding C-S lyase EgtE from Mycobacterium 
smegmatis were cloned with TncEgt1 into E. coli BL21(DE3) to produce 70 mg/L 
ERG. To improve ERG production, TNcEgt1 and EgtD were modified, and the 
resulting mutants were screened with an established high-throughput method which 
could directly analyze the ERG content in culture broths. After several rounds 
of mutation and screening, the optimal mutant MD4 was obtained and produced 290 
mg/L ERG. Furthermore, a fed-batch culture was conducted in a 5 L bioreactor. 
After optimizing the fermentation process, the ERG yield reached 5.4 g/L after 
94 h of cultivation supplemented with amino acids and glycerol, which is the 
highest ERG yield reported to date. The results showed that ERG production was 
significantly improved by modifying the key enzymes, and the engineered strains 
constructed in this study have potential industrial application prospects."
532,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current understanding of histone post-translational 
modifications (histone modifications) across immune cell types in patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during remission and flare is limited. The 
study aimed to quantify histone modifications at a single-cell resolution in IBD 
patients during remission and flare and how they differ compared to healthy 
controls.
METHODS: We performed a case-control study of 94 subjects (83 IBD patients and 
11 healthy controls). IBD patients had either UC (n=38) or CD (n=45) in clinical 
remission or flare. We used epigenetic profiling by time-of-flight (EpiTOF) to 
investigate changes in histone modifications within peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells from IBD patients.
RESULTS: We discovered substantial heterogeneity in histone modifications across 
multiple immune cell types in IBD patients. They had a higher proportion of less 
differentiated CD34 + hematopoietic progenitors, and a subset of CD56 bright NK 
cells and γδ T cells characterized by distinct histone modifications associated 
with the gene transcription. The subset of CD56 bright NK cells had increased 
several histone acetylations. An epigenetically defined subset of NK was 
associated with higher levels of CRP in peripheral blood. CD14+ monocytes from 
IBD patients had significantly decreased cleaved H3T22, suggesting they were 
epigenetically primed for macrophage differentiation.
CONCLUSION: We describe the first systems-level quantification of histone 
modifications across immune cells from IBD patients at a single-cell resolution 
revealing the increased epigenetic heterogeneity that is not possible with 
traditional ChIP-seq profiling. Our data open new directions in investigating 
the association between histone modifications and IBD pathology using other 
epigenomic tools."
533,"Pathogen effectors can suppress various plant immune responses, suggesting that 
they have multiple targets in the host. To understand the mechanisms underlying 
plasma membrane-associated and effector-mediated immunity, we performed 
Phytophthora capsici  RxLR cell death Inducer Suppressing Immune System (CRISIS) 
screening. In Nicotiana benthamiana, the cell death induced by the RxLR effector 
CRISIS2 is inhibited by the irreversible plasma membrane H +-ATPase (PMA) 
activator fusicoccin. Biochemical and gene silencing analyses revealed that 
CRISIS2 physically and functionally associates with PMAs and induces host cell 
death independent of immune receptors. CRISIS2 induces apoplastic alkalization 
by suppressing PMA activity via its association with the C-terminal regulatory 
domain of PMA. In planta expression of CRISIS2 significantly enhanced the 
virulence of P. capsici, whereas host-induced gene silencing of CRISIS2 
compromised disease symptom and biomass of P. capsici. Our study identified a 
novel RxLR effector playing multiple roles in the suppression of plant defense 
and induction of cell death to support the pathogen hemibiotrophic life cycle in 
the host plant."

535,"Brain size abnormality is correlated with an increased frequency of autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. Genetic analysis indicates that 
heterozygous mutations of the WD repeat domain 62 (WDR62) are associated with 
ASD. However, biological evidence is still lacking. Our study showed that Wdr62 
knockout (KO) led to reduced brain size with impaired learning and memory, as 
well as ASD-like behaviors in mice. Interestingly, Wdr62 Nex-cKO mice (depletion 
of WDR62 in differentiated neurons) had a largely normal brain size but with 
aberrant social interactions and repetitive behaviors. WDR62 regulated dendritic 
spinogenesis and excitatory synaptic transmission in cortical pyramidal neurons. 
Finally, we revealed that retinoic acid gavages significantly alleviated 
ASD-like behaviors in mice with WDR62 haploinsufficiency, probably by 
complementing the expression of ASD and synapse-related genes. Our findings 
provide a new perspective on the relationship between the microcephaly gene 
WDR62 and ASD etiology that will benefit clinical diagnosis and intervention of 
ASD."
536,"Accurate and efficient methods for identifying and tracking each animal in a 
group are needed to study complex behaviors and social interactions. Traditional 
tracking methods (e.g., marking each animal with dye or surgically implanting 
microchips) can be invasive and may have an impact on the social behavior being 
measured. To overcome these shortcomings, video-based methods for tracking 
unmarked animals, such as fruit flies and zebrafish, have been developed. 
However, tracking individual mice in a group remains a challenging problem 
because of their flexible body and complicated interaction patterns. In this 
study, we report the development of a multi-object tracker for mice that uses 
the Faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) deep learning 
algorithm with geometric transformations in combination with 
multi-camera/multi-image fusion technology. The system successfully tracked 
every individual in groups of unmarked mice and was applied to investigate 
chasing behavior. The proposed system constitutes a step forward in the 
noninvasive tracking of individual mice engaged in social behavior."
537,"Urinary system stones have a complex pathophysiology affected by environmental 
and genetic factors. To confirm whether ALPL gene polymorphisms are an effective 
universal risk factor for the development of urolithiasis, we aimed to 
investigate ALPL gene polymorphism in Turkish population. Our study was carried 
out with 187 patients with urolithiasis and 92 healthy volunteers (control 
group) who were not diagnosed with urolithiasis either in themselves or in their 
families, applied to Emergency Medicine Clinic of Health Sciences University 
Haydarpasa Numune Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey between 
November 2021 and February 2022, prospectively. In order to evaluate the 
relationship between ALP gene (rs1256328) polymorphism and urolithiasis, blood 
samples were analyzed by quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) method.  Male gender 
(OR:3.785; 95% CI:2.118-6.763; p<0.001), increased BUN level (OR:1.082; 95% 
CI:1.013-1.156; p=0.019), increased NLR level (OR:1.149; 95 %CI:1.033-1.277; 
p=0.011) and heterozygous genotype (OR:2.353; 95% CI:1.31-4.225; p=0.004) were 
determined as independent risk factors for the development of urolithiasis. The 
presence of heterozygous (CT) genotype in the ALPL rs1256328 gene region in the 
Turkish population is associated with an increased risk of urolithiasis. This 
suggests that ALPL rs1256328 gene polymorphism can be used as a genetic marker 
in the Turkish population."
538,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported many cases of Trichinella spiralis 
(T. spiralis) infection in normal skeletal muscle but there is little research 
on T. spiralis infection in abnormal muscle tissue.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the effect of T. spiralis infection on muscular 
dystrophy, this study compared aspects of infection between normal (C57BL/10) 
and dystrophin-deficient Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mdx mice.
METHOD: Infection rate was found to be lower in mdx mice than in C57BL/10 mice 
at early stages of infection; however, infection and inflammation in mdx mice 
persisted at later stages of infection while the infection rate and inflammation 
in C57BL/10 mice decreased gradually. The inflammation area was proportional to 
the degree of infection in both groups. Muscle strength was measured by the time 
of latency to fall in the wire-hanging test. Hanging time was shorter in the 
infected group than in the uninfected group in both C57BL/10 and mdx mice.
RESULTS: Muscle strength was also reduced in mdx mice compared with C57BL/10 
mice in both the un-infected and infected groups. The muscle intracellular 
cytokines TGF-β and IL-6 were continuously expressed from early stage to 
late-stage infection. IL-10 was strongly expressed at the early stage of 
infection but decreased as the infection progressed. TNF-α expression remained 
stable from early to late-stage infection in mdx mice, while TNF-α was elevated 
only during early-stage infection in C57BL/10 mice. The degree of muscle damage 
was significantly higher in mdx mice than in C57BL/10 mice because of the high 
level of serum creatine kinase (CK).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that mdx mice continued in infection and 
inflammation until the late stages of disease, which was in contrast to the 
C57BL/10 mice that recovered to some extent in the late stage of infection. In 
addition, that dystrophin-deficient mice are not suitable for T. spiralis 
infection compared to normal mice, and the degree of inflammation may be worse 
in mdx mice."
539,"A novel endophytic fungus producing beta-glucosidase was isolated and 
characterized from pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan [L.] Millsp.), which has excellent 
properties in converting ginsenoside Rb1 to ginsenoside Rd in Panax notoginseng. 
According to the 16S rDNA gene sequence, the G11-7 strain was identified as 
Fusarium proliferatum, and the accession number KY303906 was confirmed in 
GenBank. The G11-7 immobilized spores, in which the activity of beta-glucosidase 
could reach 0.95 U/mL, were co-cultured with P. notoginseng plant material to 
obtain a continuous beta-glucosidase supply for the biotransformation of 
ginsenoside Rb1 to Rd. Under the liquid-solid ratio (20:1), initial pH (6.0), 
and temperature (30 °C) constituents, the maximum ginsenoside Rd yield was 
obtained as 9.15 ± 0.65 mg/g, which was 3.67-fold higher than that without 
fungal spore co-culture (2.49 ± 0.98 mg/g). Furthermore, immobilized G11-7 
spores showed significant beta-glucosidase producing ability which could be 
recovered and reused for 6 cycles. Overall, these results suggested that 
immobilized G11-7 offered a promising and effective approach to enhance the 
production of ginsenoside Rd for possible nutraceutical and pharmaceutical uses."
540,"Dulaglutide is a new type of hypoglycemic agent that agonizes glucagon-like 
peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1RA). It can be concluded from previous studies that a 
GLP-1RA can reduce apoptosis and regulate autophagy in the nervous system, while 
related research on dulaglutide in vascular dementia (VD) has not been reported. 
In our study, the VD rat model was established by bilateral carotid artery 
occlusion, and the results of the Morris water maze test (MWM) and open-field 
test showed that the application of dulaglutide could effectively reduce the 
cognitive decline of VD rats without changing the behavior in the open-field 
test, which was used to assess an anxiety-like phenotype. We applied HE staining 
and immunofluorescence labeling to show that dulaglutide treatment significantly 
alleviated neuronal damage in the hippocampal region of VD rats, and reduced 
microglial and astrocyte proliferation. Western blot results showed that 
dulaglutide reduced VD-induced neuronal apoptosis (BCL2/BAX, c-caspase3) and 
autophagy (P62, LC3B, Beclin-1), and upregulated phosphorylation of 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. KEGG pathway analysis of RNA-Sequence results 
showed that the differentially expressed genes in the dulaglutide treatment 
group were significantly enriched in the mTOR signaling pathway, and the 
repressor of mTOR, Deptor, was down-regulated. In conclusion, this study 
suggested that dulaglutide may alleviate learning and memory impairment and 
neuron damage in VD rats by attenuating apoptosis, regulating autophagy, and 
activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in neurons, which may make it a 
promising candidate for the simultaneous treatment of VD and diabetes."
541,"CD8 + T cells undergo rapid expansion followed by contraction and the 
development of memory cells after their receptors are activated. The development 
of immunological memory following acute infection is a complex phenomenon that 
involves several molecular, transcriptional, and metabolic mechanisms. As memory 
cells confer long-term protection and respond to secondary stimulation with 
strong effector function, understanding the mechanisms that influence their 
development is of great importance. Orphan nuclear receptors, NR4As, are 
immediate early genes that function as transcription factors and bind with the 
NBRE region of chromatin. Interestingly, the NBRE region of activated CD8 + T 
cells is highly accessible at the same time the expression of NR4As is induced. 
This suggests a potential role of NR4As in the early events post T cell 
activation that determines cell fate decisions. In this review, we will discuss 
the influence of NR4As on the differentiation of CD8 + T cells during the immune 
response to acute infection and the development of immunological memory. We will 
also discuss the signals, transcription factors, and metabolic mechanisms that 
control cell fate decisions. HIGHLIGHTS: Memory CD8 + T cells are an essential 
subset that mediates long-term protection after pathogen encounters. Some 
specific environmental cues, transcriptional factors, and metabolic pathways 
regulate the differentiation of CD8 + T cells and the development of memory 
cells. Orphan nuclear receptor NR4As are early genes that act as transcription 
factors and are highly expressed post-T cell receptor activation. NR4As 
influence the effector function and differentiation of CD8 + T cells and also 
control the development of immunological memory following acute infection."
542,"495 bZIP members with 12 subfamilies were identified in the five diploid 
cottons. Segmental duplication events in cotton ancestor might have led to 
primary expansion of the cotton bZIP members. The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) 
transcription factor is one of the largest and most diverse families in plants. 
The evolutionary history of the bZIP family is still unclear in cotton. In this 
study, a total of 495 bZIP members were identified in five diploid Gossypium 
species, including 100 members in Gossypium arboreum, 104 members in Gossypium 
herbaceum, 95 members in Gossypium raimondii, 96 members in Gossypium 
longicalyx, and 100 members in Gossypium turneri. The bZIP members could be 
divided into 12 subfamilies with biased gene proportions, gene structures, 
conserved motifs, expansion rates, gene loss rates, and cis-regulatory elements. 
A total of 239 duplication events were identified in the five Gossypium species, 
and mainly occurred in their common ancestor. Furthermore, some GabZIPs and 
GhebZIPs could be regarded as important candidates in cotton breeding. The bZIP 
members had a conserved and divergent evolution in the five diploid Gossypium 
species. The current study laid an important foundation on the evolutionary 
history of the bZIP family in cotton."
543,"This study aimed to investigate the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of 
Chinese pediatric patients with cystinuria. This was a retrospective study of 14 
Chinese pediatric patients with cystine stones. All published studies of the 
Chinese pediatric cystinuria population were searched and enrolled based on the 
inclusive standard. Among the 14 pediatric patients with cystinuria, 8 were 
males and 6 were females. The mean age of first stone onset was 4.0 ± 3.3 years 
(4 months-9 years). All of the patients had multiple stones, and 57.1% (8/14) 
had bilateral stones. The mean maximum stone diameter was 1.7 ± 0.6 (range 
0.5-2.6) cm. A total of 13 SLC3A1 gene mutations and 9 SLC7A9 gene mutations 
were detected, of which 41% (9/22) of mutations were novel. Patients with SLC7A9 
mutations were more likely to develop bilateral stones than those with SLC3A1 
mutations (100% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.03). Thirty-four SLC3A1 gene mutations and 
twenty-eight SLC7A9 gene mutations were found in a total of fifty-five Chinese 
children with cystinuria. The SLC7A9 gene mutation distribution was more 
dispersed, while the SLC3A1 mutation was clustered in exons 6-8. The c.647C > T 
(p. T216M) (4/53) and c.1113C > A (p. Y371Ter) (4/53) mutations in the SLC3A1 
gene and the c.1399 + 2_3insT (3/36) mutation in the SLC7A9 gene represent 
potential hotspots in cystinuria. Our results present a comprehensive genetic 
spectrum for pediatric cystinuria patients in China. Patients with SLC7A9 
mutations were more likely to develop bilateral stones than those with SLC3A1 
mutations. A wide mutation spectrum and the potential mutation hotspots 
associated with cystinuria were also identified."
544,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) through mechanisms that remain incompletely 
characterized. Similar to AD, TBI models present with cellular metabolic 
alterations and modulated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). 
Specifically, AD and TBI tissues display increases in amyloid-β as well as its 
precursor, the APP C-terminal fragment of 99 a.a. (C99). Our recent data in cell 
models of AD indicate that C99, due to its affinity for cholesterol, induces the 
formation of transient lipid raft domains in the ER known as 
mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (""MAM"" domains). 
The formation of these domains recruits and activates specific lipid metabolic 
enzymes that regulate cellular cholesterol trafficking and sphingolipid 
turnover. Increased C99 levels in AD cell models promote MAM formation and 
significantly modulate cellular lipid homeostasis. Here, these phenotypes were 
recapitulated in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI in adult 
mice. Specifically, the injured cortex and hippocampus displayed significant 
increases in C99 and MAM activity, as measured by phospholipid synthesis, 
sphingomyelinase activity and cholesterol turnover. In addition, our cell 
type-specific lipidomics analyses revealed significant changes in microglial 
lipid composition that are consistent with the observed alterations in 
MAM-resident enzymes. Altogether, we propose that alterations in the regulation 
of MAM and relevant lipid metabolic pathways could contribute to the 
epidemiological connection between TBI and AD."
545,"PURPOSE: Examining epigenetic patterns is a crucial step in identifying 
molecular changes of disease pathophysiology, with DNA methylation as the most 
accessible epigenetic measure. Diet is suggested to affect metabolism and health 
via epigenetic modifications. Thus, our aim was to explore the association 
between food consumption and DNA methylation.
METHODS: Epigenome-wide association studies were conducted in three cohorts: 
KORA FF4, TwinsUK, and Leiden Longevity Study, and 37 dietary exposures were 
evaluated. Food group definition was harmonized across the three cohorts. DNA 
methylation was measured using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip in KORA and 
Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in the Leiden study and the TwinsUK study. 
Overall, data from 2293 middle-aged men and women were included. A fixed-effects 
meta-analysis pooled study-specific estimates. The significance threshold was 
set at 0.05 for false-discovery rate-adjusted p values per food group.
RESULTS: We identified significant associations between the methylation level of 
CpG sites and the consumption of onions and garlic (2), nuts and seeds (18), 
milk (1), cream (11), plant oils (4), butter (13), and alcoholic beverages (27). 
The signals targeted genes of metabolic health relevance, for example, GLI1, 
RPTOR, and DIO1, among others.
CONCLUSION: This EWAS is unique with its focus on food groups that are part of a 
Western diet. Significant findings were mostly related to food groups with a 
high-fat content."
546,"Accurate measurement of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) copy 
number variation (CNV) is very important for guiding the tumor target therapy in 
breast cancer. Digital PCR (dPCR) is a sensitive and an absolute quantitative 
method, which can be used to detect HER2 CNV. Three HER2 exon-specific digital 
PCR assays along with three new reference genes assays (homo sapiens 
ribonuclease P RNA component H1 (RPPH1), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), 
and chromosome 1 open reading frame 43 (C1ORF43), on different chromosomes) were 
established and validated by using standard reference material, 8 different cell 
lines and 110 clinical Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. DPCR 
can achieve precise quantification of HER2 CNV by calculating the ratio of 
HER2/reference gene. The positive and negative coincidence rates were 98% 
(53/54) and 95% (53/56), respectively, compared with fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH) diagnostic result 110 of FFPE samples. The common reference 
gene CEP17 used for FISH diagnostic was not suitable as single reference gene 
for HER2 CNV measurements by dPCR. The best practice of HER2 CNV determination 
by dPCR is to conduct the three duplex assays of H1 (HER2 exon 4) with the 
proposed three new reference genes, with a positive cut-off value of 
H1/RPPH1 ≥ 2.0 or H1/averaged reference gene ≥ 2.0. The proposed dPCR method in 
our study can accurately provide absolute copy number of HER2 and reference gene 
on an alternative chromosome, thus avoiding false negative caused by polysomy of 
chromosome 17. The improved molecular typing and diagnosis of breast cancer will 
better guide clinical medication."
547,"OBJECTIVE: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease mediated by 
antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The thymus plays a primary 
role in AChR-MG and is characterized by a type I interferon (IFN) signature 
linked to IFN-β. We investigated if AChR-MG was characterized by an IFN-I 
signature in the blood, and further investigated the chronic thymic IFN-I 
signature.
METHODS: Serum levels of IFN-β and IFN-α subtypes, and mRNA expression for IFN-I 
subtypes and IFN-stimulated genes in PBMCs were analyzed. The contribution of 
endogenous nucleic acids in thymic expression of IFN-I subtypes was investigated 
in human thymic epithelial cell cultures and the mouse thymus. By 
immunohistochemistry, thymic CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages were analyzed in 
AChR-MG. To investigate the impact of a decrease in thymic macrophages, mice 
were treated with an anti-CSF1R antibody.
RESULTS: No IFN-I signature was observed in the periphery emphasizing that the 
IFN-I signature is restricted to the MG thymus. Molecules mimicking endogenous 
dsDNA signalization (Poly(dA:dT) and 2'3'-cGAMP), or dexamethasone-induced 
necrotic thymocytes increased IFN-β and α-AChR expression by thymic epithelial 
cells, and in the mouse thymus. A significant decrease in thymic macrophages was 
demonstrated in AChR-MG. In mice, a decrease in thymic macrophages led to an 
increase of necrotic thymocytes associated with IFN-β and α-AChR expression.
INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that the decrease of thymic macrophages in 
AChR-MG impairs the elimination of apoptotic thymocytes favoring the release of 
endogenous nucleic acids from necrotic thymocytes. In this inflammatory context, 
thymic epithelial cells may overexpress IFN-β, which specifically induces 
α-AChR, resulting in self-sensitization and thymic changes leading to AChR-MG.

548,"BACKGROUND: As in other domains of medicine, high-throughput sequencing methods 
have led to the identification of an ever-increasing number of gene variants in 
the fields of both male and female infertility. The increasing number of 
recently identified genes allows an accurate diagnosis for previously idiopathic 
cases of female infertility and more appropriate patient care. However, robust 
evidence of the gene-disease relationships (GDR) allowing the proper translation 
to clinical application is still missing in many cases.
OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: An evidence-based curation of currently identified 
genes involved in female infertility and differences in sex development (DSD) 
would significantly improve both diagnostic performance and genetic research. We 
therefore performed a systematic review to summarize current knowledge and 
assess the available GDR.
SEARCH METHODS: PRISMA guidelines were applied to curate all available 
information from PubMed and Web of Science on genetics of human female 
infertility and DSD leading to infertility, from 1 January 1988 to 1 November 
2021. The reviewed pathologies include non-syndromic as well as syndromic female 
infertility, and endocrine and reproductive system disorders. The evidence that 
an identified phenotype is caused by pathogenic variants in a specific gene was 
assessed according to a standardized scoring system. A final score (no evidence, 
limited, moderate, strong, or definitive) was assigned to every GDR.
OUTCOMES: A total of 45 271 publications were identified and screened for 
inclusion of which 1078 were selected for gene and variant extraction. We have 
identified 395 genes and validated 466 GDRs covering all reported monogenic 
causes of female infertility and DSD. Furthermore, we present a genetic 
diagnostic flowchart including 105 genes with at least moderate evidence for 
female infertility and suggest recommendations for future research. The study 
did not take into account associated genetic risk factor(s) or 
oligogenic/polygenic causes of female infertility.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS: We have comprehensively reviewed the existing research on 
the genetics of female infertility and DSD, which will enable the development of 
diagnostic panels using validated genes. Whole genome analysis is shifting from 
predominantly research to clinical application, increasing its diagnostic 
potential. These new diagnostic possibilities will not only decrease the number 
of idiopathic cases but will also render genetic counselling more effective for 
infertile patients and their families."
549,"Spermatogenesis is a complex process that includes spermatogonia self-renewal, 
spermatocyte meiosis and spermatozoa assembly. Recent studies have revealed that 
WD40-repeat domain-containing (WDR) proteins play important roles in 
spermatocyte division, spermatozoa flagella assembly and head shaping. In this 
study, we investigated the expression pattern of WDR87 and found that it was 
highly expressed in the testis of both humans and mice. Immunofluorescence 
staining revealed that mouse WDR87 was distributed in the perinuclear cytoplasm 
of primary spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids. In the 
spermiogenesis stage, with extension of the nucleus, WDR87 migrated to the 
manchette and finally localized to the middle piece of the spermatozoa tail. 
Furthermore, we identified a cilia- and flagella-associated protein, CFAP47, 
which interacted with WDR87 in the flagellar midpiece of the spermatozoa, 
suggesting that WDR87 may be associated with multiple morphological 
abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF). Subsequently, we screened gene mutations 
in seven MMAF individuals and found two novel mutations in CFAP47 (c.706G>A, 
Val236Met; c.1337C>T, Thr446Met) in one case. Immunoblotting and 
immunofluorescence revealed that CFAP47 was dramatically reduced in spermatozoa 
from the CFAP47-mutated man. Meanwhile, the expression of WDR87 was also 
significantly decreased, and weak signals were detected adjacent to the 
spermatozoa nuclei, indicating that CFAP47 was necessary for WDR87 
transportation during spermatozoa flagella biogenesis. These data indicate that 
WDR87 is located in the middle piece of the sperm tail and interacts with CFAP47 
to form a complex which is involved in spermatozoa tail assembly."
550,"Bacterial viruses are the most abundant biological entities in soil ecosystems. 
Owing to the advent of metagenomics and viromics approaches, an ever-increasing 
diversity of virus-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) have been identified 
in soils, including those involved in the transformation of carbon, phosphorus, 
and sulfur, degradation of organic pollutants, and antibiotic resistance, among 
other processes. These viral AMGs can alter soil biogeochemical processes and 
metabolic activities by interfering with bacterial host metabolism. It is 
recognized that viral AMGs compensate for host bacterial metabolism outputs by 
encoding accessory functional genes and are favorable for the hosts' adaptation 
to stressed soil environments. The eco-evolutionary mechanisms behind this 
fascinating diversity of viral AMGs in soil microbiomes have begun to emerge, 
such as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), lytic-lysogenic conversion, and 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms. In this mini-review, we summarize recent 
advances in the diversity and function of virus-encoded AMGs in the soil 
environment, especially focusing on the evolutionary significance of AMGs 
involved in virus-host interactions. This mini-review also sheds light on the 
existing gaps and future perspectives that could have major significance for 
viral AMGs research in soils. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

551,"MOTIVATION: RNA viruses tend to mutate constantly. While many of the variants 
are neutral, some can lead to higher transmissibility or virulence. Accurate 
assembly of complete viral genomes enables identification of underlying 
variants, which are essential for studying virus evolution and elucidating the 
relationship between genotypes and virus properties. Recently, third-generation 
sequencing platforms such as Nanopore sequencers have been used for real-time 
virus sequencing for Ebola, Zika, COVID-19, etc. However, their high per-base 
error rate prevents accurate reconstruction of the viral genome.
RESULTS: In this work, we introduce a new tool, AccuVIR, for viral genome 
assembly and polishing using error-prone long reads. It can better distinguish 
sequencing errors from true variants based on the key observation that 
sequencing errors can disrupt the gene structures of viruses, which usually have 
high density of coding regions. Our experimental results on both simulated and 
real third-generation sequencing data demonstrated its superior performance on 
generating more accurate viral genomes than generic assembly or polish tools.

552,"Ion channels play an important role for regulation of the exocrine and the 
endocrine pancreas. This review focuses on the Ca2+-regulated K+ channel KCa3.1, 
encoded by the KCNN4 gene, which is present in both parts of the pancreas. In 
the islets of Langerhans, KCa3.1 channels are involved in the regulation of 
membrane potential oscillations characterizing nutrient-stimulated islet 
activity. Channel upregulation is induced by gluco- or lipotoxic conditions and 
might contribute to micro-inflammation and impaired insulin release in type 2 
diabetes mellitus as well as to diabetes-associated renal and vascular 
complications. In the exocrine pancreas KCa3.1 channels are expressed in acinar 
and ductal cells. They are thought to play a role for anion secretion during 
digestion but their physiological role has not been fully elucidated yet. 
Pancreatic carcinoma, especially pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is 
associated with drastic overexpression of KCa3.1. For pharmacological targeting 
of KCa3.1 channels, we are discussing the possible benefits KCa3.1 channel 
inhibitors might provide in the context of diabetes mellitus and pancreatic 
cancer, respectively. We are also giving a perspective for the use of a 
fluorescently labeled derivative of the KCa3.1 blocker senicapoc as a tool to 
monitor channel distribution in pancreatic tissue. In summary, modulating KCa3.1 
channel activity is a useful strategy for exo-and endocrine pancreatic disease 
but further studies are needed to evaluate its clinical suitability."
553,"The structural, composition, and molecular interaction of silver integrated zinc 
oxide (20 wt.% Ag/ZnO) were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy 
dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) 
spectrum. The XRD analysis showed the polycrystalline of small crystallite size, 
whereas the EDX spectrum confirmed the purity of the nanocomposite. The FTIR 
spectrum indicated the presence of Ag-Zn-O stretching vibration at 1034 cm-1. 
SEM and TEM images identified the surface morphology and particle size, 
indicating that Ag/ZnO of nanorods linked with spherical-like shapes. The 
nanorods of an average length of  ∼ 110 nm and an average diameter of  ∼ 10 nm. 
The optical characteristics showed a direct transition of electrons through an 
energy gap in the 3.30 eV-3.60 eV. The tested nanocomposite exhibited potent 
cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells with an IC50 value of 0.26 µg/ml with cell 
growth inhibition by 97.3% at the highest concentration compared to Doxorubicin 
(IC50=6.72 µg/ml). It significantly stimulated total apoptotic breast cancer 
cell death by 51-fold (32.16% compared to 0.63 for the control), arresting the 
cell progression at the G1 phase. For further validation of apoptotic activity, 
the tested Ag/ZnO-NP upregulated the proapoptotic genes and down-regulated the 
anti-apoptotic gene. Moreover, a molecular docking study highlighted the binding 
disposition of the nanocomposite as Bcl-2 inhibitors. Additionally, Ag/ZnO-NP 
exhibited potent antimicrobial activity. Hence, the synthesized nanocomposite 
can serve as an antimicrobial and cytotoxic agent through apoptosis-induction 
and could be developed as a biologically active nanocomposite.Communicated by

554,"SUMMARY: In this study, we herein describe a 47-year-old Japanese woman who 
manifested inheritable non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and severe 
dyslipidemia. Interestingly, her NASH progression was ameliorated by treatment 
with a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. This inheritability 
prompted us to comprehensively decode her genomic information using whole-exome 
sequencing. We found the well-established I148M mutation in PNPLA3 as well as 
mutations in LGALS3 and PEMT for her NASH. Mutations in GCKR may contribute to 
both NASH and dyslipidemia. We further mined gene mutations potentially 
responsible for her manifestations that led to the identification of a novel 
M188fs mutation in MUL1 that may be causally associated with her mitochondrial 
dysfunction. Our case may provide some clues to better understand this spectrum 
of disease as well as the rationale for selecting medications.
LEARNING POINTS: While the PNPLA3 I148M mutation is well-established, 
accumulation of other mutations may accelerate susceptibility to non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH and dyslipidemia may be intertwined biochemically 
and genetically through several key genes. SGLT2 inhibitors emerge as promising 
treatment for NASH albeit with interindividual variation in efficacy. Genetic 
background may explain the mechanisms behind the variation. A novel 
dysfunctional mutation in MUL1 may lead to metabolic inflexibilities through 
impaired mitochondrial dynamics and function."
555,"PURPOSE: RAS genes (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS) are commonly mutated genes in cancer, 
and activating RAS variants are also found in disorders of somatic mosaicism 
(DoSM). A survey of the mutational spectrum of RAS variants in DoSM has not been 
performed.
METHODS: A total of 938 individuals with suspected DoSM underwent 
high-sensitivity clinical NGS-based testing. We investigated the mutational 
spectrum and genotype-phenotype associations of mosaic RAS variants.
RESULTS: Here we present a series of individuals with DoSM with RAS variants. 
Classic hotspots, including Gly12, Gly13, and Gln61 constituted the majority of 
RAS variants observed in DoSM. Further, we present 12 individuals with HRAS and 
KRAS in-frame duplications/insertions (dup/ins) variants in the switch II 
domain. Among the 18.3% of individuals with RAS in-frame dup/ins variants, 
clinical findings were mainly associated with vascular malformations. Hotspots 
were associated with a broad phenotypic spectrum, including vascular tumors, 
vascular malformations, nevoid proliferations, segmental overgrowth, digital 
anomalies, and combinations. The median age at testing for individuals with 
in-frame dup/ins variants was older, and the variant allele fraction was lower 
compared to those with mosaic RAS hotspots.
CONCLUSION: Our work provides insight into the allelic and clinical 
heterogeneity of mosaic RAS variants in non-malignant conditions."
556,"PURPOSE: Nephrolithiasis (NL) affects 1 in 11 individuals worldwide, leading to 
significant patient morbidity. NL is associated with nephrocalcinosis (NC), a 
risk factor for chronic kidney disease. Causative genetic variants are detected 
in 11-28% of NL and/or NC, suggesting additional NL/NC-associated genetic loci 
await discovery. Therefore, we employed genomic approaches to discover novel 
genetic forms of NL/NC.
METHODS: Exome sequencing and directed sequencing of the OXGR1 locus were 
performed in a worldwide NL/NC cohort. Putatively deleterious rare OXGR1 
variants were functionally characterized.
RESULTS: Exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous OXGR1 missense variant 
(c.371T>G, p.L124R) co-segregating with calcium oxalate NL and/or NC disease in 
an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern within a multi-generational family 
with five affected individuals. OXGR1 encodes 2-oxoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate) 
receptor 1 in the distal nephron. In response to its ligand α-ketoglutarate 
(AKG), OXGR1 stimulates the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger Pendrin, which also 
regulates transepithelial calcium transport in cortical connecting tubules. 
Strong amino acid conservation in orthologues and paralogues, severe in silico 
prediction scores, and extreme rarity in exome population databases suggested 
the variant was deleterious. Interrogation of the OXGR1 locus in 1107 additional 
NL/NC families identified five additional deleterious dominant variants in five 
families with calcium oxalate NL/NC. Rare, potentially deleterious OXGR1 
variants were enriched in NL/NC subjects relative to ExAC controls (Χ2=7.117, 
p=0.0076). Wildtype OXGR1-expressing Xenopus oocytes exhibited AKG-responsive 
Ca2+ uptake. Four of five NL/NC-associated missense variants revealed impaired 
AKG-dependent Ca2+ uptake, demonstrating loss-of-function.
CONCLUSION: Rare, dominant loss-of-function OXGR1 variants are associated with 
recurrent calcium oxalate NL/NC disease."
557,"Survival studies are an important indicator of the success of cancer control. We 
analyzed the 5-year relative survival in 23 solid cancers in Denmark, Finland, 
Norway and Sweden over a 50-year period (1970-2019) at the NORDCAN database 
accessed from the International Agency for Research on Cancer website. We 
plotted survival curves in 5-year periods and showed 5-year periodic survival. 
The survival results were summarized in 4 groups: 1) cancers with historically 
good survival (>50% in 1970-74) which include melanoma and breast, endometrial 
and thyroid cancers; 2) cancers which constantly improved survival at least 20 % 
units over the 50 year period, including cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, 
kidney, brain and ovary; 3) cancer with increase in survival >20 % units with 
changes taking place in a narrow time window, including oral, oropharyngeal, 
testicular and prostate cancers; 4) the remaining cancers with <20 % unit 
improvement in survival including lung, esophageal, liver, pancreatic, bladder, 
soft tissue, penile, cervical and vulvar cancers. For cancers in groups 1 and 2, 
the constant development implied multiple improvements in therapy, diagnosis and 
patient care. Cancers in group 3 included testicular cancers with known 
therapeutic improvements but for the others large incidence changes probably 
implied that cancer stage (prostate) or etiology (oropharynx) changed into a 
more tractable form. Group 4 cancers included those with dismal survival 
50 years ago but a clear tendency upwards. In 17 cancers 5-year survival reached 
between 50 and 100 % while in only 6 cancers it remained at below 50%. This

558,"Most human tissue injuries lead to the formation of a fibrous scar and result in 
the loss of functional tissue. One adult tissue that exhibits a more 
regenerative response to injury with minimal scarring is the oral mucosa. We 
generated a microarray gene expression dataset to examine the response to injury 
from human palate and skin excisional biopsies spanning the first seven days 
after wounding. Differential expression analyses were performed in each tissue 
to identify genes overexpressed or underexpressed over time compared to baseline 
unwounded tissue. To attribute biological processes of interest to these gene 
expression changes, gene set enrichment analysis was used to identify core gene 
sets that are enriched over the time-course of the wound healing process with 
respect to unwounded tissue. This analysis identified gene sets uniquely 
enriched in either palate or skin wounds and gene sets that are enriched in both 
tissues in at least one time point after injury. Finally, a cell type enrichment 
analysis was performed to better understand the cell type distribution in these 
tissues and how it changes over the time course of wound healing. This work 
provides a source of human wound gene expression data that includes two tissue 
types with distinct regenerative and scarring phenotypes. This article is

559,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) derived from any tumor tissue could contribute to 
metastasis and resistance to cancer treatments. In this study, we performed 
single-cell next-generation sequencing of CTCs and evaluated usefulness for 
characterizing tumor biology and mechanisms of metastasis in neuroblastomas 
(NB). We aimed to isolate CTCs from ten patients with NB at diagnosis before any 
treatments and four patients at relapse. GD2+ , CD90+ , CD45- , CD235a- , and 
DAPI- cells were isolated as neuroblastoma CTCs using fluorescence-activated 
cell sorting. In five patients with advanced stages (M stage), DNA and RNA 
sequencing of CTCs at single-cell level were performed. NB CTCs were isolated 
from eight of the ten patients at diagnosis and three of the four patients at 
relapse. More CTCs could be isolated from patients with advanced stages. In one 
patient, ALK mutation (p.F1174L), was identified in both tumor tissue and a CTC. 
In patients with MYCN amplification, this gene was amplified in 12 of 13 CTCs. 
Using single-cell RNA sequencing, angiogenesis- and cell cycle-related genes 
together with CCND1, TUBA1A genes were found to be upregulated in CTCs. In one 
patient, CTCs were divided into two subgroups showing different gene expression 
profiles. In one subgroup, cell cycle- and proliferation-related genes were 
differentially upregulated than the other. In conclusion, next-generation 
sequencing of CTCs at single-cell level might help to characterize tumor biology 
and mechanisms of metastasis in NB."
560,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease affecting women, caused by 
somatic mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, and driven by estrogen. Similar to 
many cancers, it is metastatic, primarily to the lung. Despite its monogenetic 
nature, like many cancers, LAM is a heterogeneous disease. The cellular 
constituents of LAM are very diverse, including mesenchymal, epithelial, 
endothelial and immune cells. LAM is characterized by dysregulation of many cell 
signaling pathways, distinct populations of LAM cells, and a rich 
microenvironment, in which the immune system appears to play an important role. 
This review delineates the heterogeneity of LAM and focuses on the metastatic 
features of LAM, the deregulated signaling mechanisms and the tumor 
microenvironment. Understanding the tumor-host interaction in LAM may provide 
insights into development of new therapeutic strategies, which could be 
combinatorial or superlative to Sirolimus, the current FDA-approved treatment."
561,"Foraging behaviours encompass strategies to locate resources and to exploit 
them. In many taxa, these behaviours are driven by a major gene called for, but 
mechanisms vary between species. In the parasitoid wasp Venturia canescens, 
sexual and asexual populations coexist in sympatry but differ in life-history 
trait, physiology and behaviours, which could impact their foraging strategies. 
Here, we explored the molecular bases underpinning divergence in behaviours by 
testing two mutually nonexclusive hypotheses: first, the divergence in the for 
gene correlates with difference in foraging strategies, and second, the latter 
rely on a divergence in whole-genome expression. Using comparative genomics, we 
showed that the for gene was conserved across insects considering both sequence 
and gene model complexity. Polymorphism analysis did not support the occurrence 
of two allelic variants diverging across the two populations, yet the asexual 
population exhibited less polymorphism than the sexual population. Sexual and 
asexual transcriptomes sharply split, with 10.9% of differentially expressed 
genes, but these were not enriched in behavioural-related genes. We showed that 
the for gene was more highly expressed in asexual female heads than in sexual 
heads and that those differences correlate with divergence in foraging 
behaviours in our experiment since asexuals explored the environment more and 
exploited more host patches. Overall, these results suggested that fine tuning 
of for gene expression between populations may have led to distinct foraging 
behaviours. We hypothesized that reproductive polymorphism and coexistence in 
sympatry of sexual and asexual populations specialized to different ecological 
niches via divergent optima on phenotypic traits could imply adaptation through 
different expression patterns of the for gene and at many other loci throughout 
the genome."
562,"Photosynthesis and photorespiration represent the largest carbon fluxes in plant 
primary metabolism and are necessary for plant survival. Many of the enzymes and 
genes important for photosynthesis and photorespiration have been well studied 
for decades, but some aspects of these biochemical pathways and their crosstalk 
with several subcellular processes are not yet fully understood. Much of the 
work that has identified the genes and proteins important in plant metabolism 
has been conducted under highly controlled environments that may not best 
represent how photosynthesis and photorespiration function under natural and 
farming environments. Considering that abiotic stress results in impaired 
photosynthetic efficiency, the development of a high-throughput screen that can 
monitor both abiotic stress and its impact on photosynthesis is necessary. 
Therefore, we have developed a relatively fast method to screen for abiotic 
stress-induced changes to photosynthetic efficiency that can identify 
uncharacterized genes with roles in photorespiration using chlorophyll 
fluorescence analysis and low CO2 screening. This paper describes a method to 
study changes in photosynthetic efficiency in transferred DNA (T-DNA) knockout 
mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana. The same method can be used for screening ethyl 
methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced mutants or suppressor screening. Utilizing this 
method can identify gene candidates for further study in plant primary 
metabolism and abiotic stress responses. Data from this method can provide 
insight into gene function that may not be recognized until exposure to 
increased stress environments."
563,"Aging is a complex process characterized by progressive physiological changes 
resulting from both environmental and genetic contributions. Lipids are crucial 
in constituting structural components of cell membranes, storing energy, and as 
signaling molecules. Regulation of lipid metabolism and signaling is essential 
to activate distinct longevity pathways. The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is 
an excellent and powerful organism to dissect the contribution of lipid 
metabolism and signaling in longevity regulation. Multiple research studies have 
described how diet supplementation of specific lipid molecules can extend C. 
elegans lifespan; however, minor differences in the supplementation conditions 
can cause reproducibility issues among scientists in different labs. Here, two 
detailed supplementation methods for C. elegans are reported employing lipid 
supplementation either with bacteria seeded on plates or bacterial suspension in 
liquid culture. Also provided herein are the details to perform lifespan assays 
with lifelong lipid supplementation and qRT-PCR analysis using a whole worm 
lysate or dissected tissues derived from a few worms. Using a combination of 
longitudinal studies and transcriptional investigations upon lipid 
supplementation, the feeding assays provide dependable approaches to dissect how 
lipids influence longevity and healthy aging. This methodology can also be 
adapted for various nutritional screening approaches to assess changes in a 
subset of transcripts using either a small number of dissected tissues or a few 
animals."
564,"Phylogeographic congruence among co-distributed taxa is regarded as an inherent 
inference to vicariance events. However, incongruent patterns of contemporary 
lineage divergence among taxa indicated that species differ in their response to 
common past events. To investigate the role of past events, ecological traits 
and lineage diversification time in shaping the contemporary phylogeographic 
patterns, comparative analyses were conducted for Tibetan stone loaches in the 
Himalayas region using three gene markers and two ecological traits (depth of 
caudal peduncle in its length and posterior of air bladder presence/absence). By 
a thorough sampling in two flanks of the Himalayas, we detected that 
phylogenetic breaks were spatially discordant and divergences of populations 
were also temporally asynchronous in co-distributed loaches. Estimated 
divergence time using fossils calibrated node dating indicated that the Tibetan 
stone loaches colonized into the south flank of the Himalayas until the 
Pleistocene. The demographic expansions were also disconcerted between 
populations in north and south flanks, or east and west Himalayas. Ongoing gene 
flows between populations in north and south sides implied that the Himalayas do 
not strictly impede dispersal for cold-adaption species. Our results highlight 
that the Quaternary climatic oscillation in conjunction with ecological traits 
and lineage diversification time, sculpted contemporary phylogenetic patterns of 
stone loaches in the Himalayas, and provide new insights into the biodiversity 
and composition of species in the Himalayas and surrounding region. This article

565,"Activating V600E in v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) is a 
common driver mutation in cancers of multiple tissue origins, including melanoma 
and glioma. BRAFV600E has also been implicated in neurodegeneration. The present 
study aims to characterize BRAFV600E during cell death and proliferation of 
three major cell types of the central nervous system: neurons, astrocytes, and 
microglia. Multiple primary cultures (primary cortical mixed culture) and cell 
lines of glial cells (BV2) and neurons (SH-SY5Y) were employed. BRAFV600E and 
BRAFWT expression was mediated by lentivirus or retrovirus. Blockage of 
downstream effectors (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and JNK1/2) were 
achieved by siRNA. In astrocytes and microglia, BRAFV600E induces cell 
proliferation, and the proliferative effect in microglia is mediated by 
activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, but not c-Jun N-terminal 
kinase. Conditioned medium from BRAFV600E-expressing microglia induced neuronal 
death. In neuronal cells, BRAFV600E directly induces neuronal death, through 
c-Jun N-terminal kinase but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase. We 
further show that BRAF-related genes are enriched in pathways in patients with 
Parkinson's disease. Our study identifies distinct consequences mediated by 
distinct downstream effectors in dividing glial cells and in neurons following 
the same BRAF mutational activation and a causal link between BRAF-activated 
microglia and neuronal cell death that does not require physical proximity. It 
provides insight into a possibly important role of BRAF in neurodegeneration as 
a result of either dysregulated BRAF in neurons or its impact on glial cells."
566,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a vital role in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. 
However, their expression and function in Schwann cells in individuals with 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy remain poorly understood. Here, we performed 
protein profiling and circRNA sequencing of sural nerves in patients with 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy and controls. Protein profiling revealed 265 
differentially expressed proteins in the diabetic peripheral neuropathy group. 
Gene Ontology indicated that differentially expressed proteins were mainly 
enriched in myelination and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. A real-time 
polymerase chain reaction assay performed to validate the circRNA sequencing 
results yielded 11 differentially expressed circRNAs. circ_0002538 was markedly 
downregulated in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Further in vitro 
experiments showed that overexpression of circ_0002538 promoted the migration of 
Schwann cells by upregulating plasmolipin (PLLP) expression. Moreover, 
overexpression of circ_0002538 in the sciatic nerve in a streptozotocin-induced 
mouse model of diabetic peripheral neuropathy alleviated demyelination and 
improved sciatic nerve function. The results of a mechanistic experiment showed 
that circ_0002538 promotes PLLP expression by sponging miR-138-5p, while a lack 
of circ_0002538 led to a PLLP deficiency that further suppressed Schwann cell 
migration. These findings suggest that the circ_0002538/miR-138-5p/PLLP axis can 
promote the migration of Schwann cells in diabetic peripheral neuropathy 
patients, improving myelin sheath structure and nerve function. Thus, this axis 
is a potential target for therapeutic treatment of diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy."
567,"The neuronal differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells offers a new strategy for 
the treatment of neurological disorders. Thus, there is a need to identify a 
noninvasive and sensitive in vivo imaging approach for real-time monitoring of 
transplanted stem cells. Our previous study confirmed that magnetic resonance 
imaging, with a focus on the ferritin heavy chain 1 reporter gene, could track 
the proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells that 
had been transduced with lentivirus carrying the ferritin heavy chain 1 reporter 
gene. However, we could not determine whether or when bone marrow mesenchymal 
stem cells had undergone neuronal differentiation based on changes in the 
magnetic resonance imaging signal. To solve this problem, we identified a 
neuron-specific enolase that can be differentially expressed before and after 
neuronal differentiation in stem cells. In this study, we successfully 
constructed a lentivirus carrying the neuron-specific enolase promoter and 
expressing the ferritin heavy chain 1 reporter gene; we used this lentivirus to 
transduce bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Cellular and animal studies showed 
that the neuron-specific enolase promoter effectively drove the expression of 
ferritin heavy chain 1 after neuronal differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal 
stem cells; this led to intracellular accumulation of iron and corresponding 
changes in the magnetic resonance imaging signal. In summary, we established an 
innovative magnetic resonance imaging approach focused on the induction of 
reporter gene expression by a neuron-specific promoter. This imaging method can 
be used to noninvasively and sensitively detect neuronal differentiation in stem 
cells, which may be useful in stem cell-based therapies."
568,"Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G is down-regulated in the spinal cord of 
the Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur (TG) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model. However, 
most studies have only examined heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G 
expression in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis model and heterogenous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein G effects in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathogenesis such 
as in apoptosis are unknown. In this study, we studied the potential mechanism 
of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G in neuronal death in the spinal cord 
of TG and wild-type mice and examined the mechanism by which heterogenous 
nuclear ribonucleoprotein G induces apoptosis. Heterogenous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein G in spinal cord was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and 
western blotting, and cell proliferation and proteins (TAR DNA binding protein 
43, superoxide dismutase 1, and Bax) were detected by the Cell Counting Kit-8 
and western blot analysis in heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G 
siRNA-transfected PC12 cells. We analyzed heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein 
G distribution in spinal cord in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis model at 
various time points and the expressions of apoptosis and proliferation-related 
proteins. Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G was mainly localized in 
neurons. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice were examined at three stages: 
preonset (60-70 days), onset (90-100 days) and progression (120-130 days). The 
number of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G-positive cells was 
significantly higher in the anterior horn of the lumbar spinal cord segment of 
TG mice at the preonset stage than that of control group but lower than that of 
the control group at the onset stage. The number of heterogenous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein G-positive cells in both central canal and surrounding gray 
matter of the whole spinal cord of TG mice at the onset stage was significantly 
lower than that in the control group, whereas that of the lumbar spinal cord 
segment of TG mice was significantly higher than that in the control group at 
preonset stage and significantly lower than that in the control group at the 
progression stage. The numbers of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein 
G-positive cells in the posterior horn of cervical and thoracic segments of TG 
mice at preonset and progression stages were significantly lower than those in 
the control group. The expression of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G in 
the cervical spinal cord segment of TG mice was significantly higher than that 
in the control group at the preonset stage but significantly lower at the 
progression stage. The expression of heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G in 
the thoracic spinal cord segment of TG mice was significantly increased at the 
preonset stage, significantly decreased at the onset stage, and significantly 
increased at the progression stage compared with the control group. heterogenous 
nuclear ribonucleoprotein G expression in the lumbar spinal cord segment of TG 
mice was significantly lower than that of the control group at the progression 
stage. After heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein G gene silencing, PC12 cell 
survival was lower than that of control cells. Both TAR DNA binding protein 43 
and Bax expressions were significantly increased in heterogenous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein G-silenced cells compared with control cells. Our study 
suggests that abnormal distribution and expression of heterogenous nuclear 
ribonucleoprotein G might play a protective effect in amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis development via preventing neuronal death by reducing abnormal TAR DNA 
binding protein 43 generation in the spinal cord."
569,"Post-traumatic spinal cord remodeling includes both degenerating and 
regenerating processes, which affect the potency of the functional recovery 
after spinal cord injury (SCI). Gene therapy for spinal cord injury is proposed 
as a promising therapeutic strategy to induce positive changes in remodeling of 
the affected neural tissue. In our previous studies for delivering the 
therapeutic genes at the site of spinal cord injury, we developed a new approach 
using an autologous leucoconcentrate transduced ex vivo with chimeric 
adenoviruses (Ad5/35) carrying recombinant cDNA. In the present study, the 
efficacy of the intravenous infusion of an autologous genetically-enriched 
leucoconcentrate simultaneously producing recombinant vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and 
neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was evaluated with regard to the molecular 
and cellular changes in remodeling of the spinal cord tissue at the site of 
damage in a model of mini-pigs with moderate spinal cord injury. Experimental 
animals were randomly divided into two groups of 4 pigs each: the therapeutic 
(infused with the leucoconcentrate simultaneously transduced with a combination 
of the three chimeric adenoviral vectors Ad5/35-VEGF165, Ad5/35-GDNF, and 
Ad5/35-NCAM1) and control groups (infused with intact leucoconcentrate). The 
morphometric and immunofluorescence analysis of the spinal cord regeneration in 
the rostral and caudal segments according to the epicenter of the injury in the 
treated animals compared to the control mini-pigs showed: (1) higher sparing of 
the grey matter and increased survivability of the spinal cord cells (lower 
number of Caspase-3-positive cells and decreased expression of Hsp27); (2) 
recovery of synaptophysin expression; (3) prevention of astrogliosis (lower area 
of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes and ionized calcium 
binding adaptor molecule 1-positive microglial cells); (4) higher growth rates 
of regenerating βIII-tubulin-positive axons accompanied by a higher number of 
oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2-positive oligodendroglial cells in the 
lateral corticospinal tract region. These results revealed the efficacy of 
intravenous infusion of the autologous genetically-enriched leucoconcentrate 
producing recombinant VEGF, GDNF, and NCAM in the acute phase of spinal cord 
injury on the positive changes in the post-traumatic remodeling nervous tissue 
at the site of direct injury. Our data provide a solid platform for a new ex 
vivo gene therapy for spinal cord injury and will facilitate further translation 
of regenerative therapies in clinical neurology."
570,"Alteration of the outer retina leads to various diseases such as age-related 
macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa characterized by decreased visual 
acuity and ultimately blindness. Despite intensive research in the field of 
retinal disorders, there is currently no curative treatment. Several therapeutic 
approaches such as cell-based replacement and gene therapies are currently in 
development. In the context of cell-based therapies, different cell sources such 
as embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, or multipotent stem 
cells can be used for transplantation. In the vast majority of human clinical 
trials, retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptors are the cell types 
considered for replacement cell therapies. In this review, we summarize the 
progress made in stem cell therapies ranging from the pre-clinical studies to 
clinical trials for retinal disease."
571,"Huntington's disease is a genetic disease caused by expanded CAG repeats on exon 
1 of the huntingtin gene located on chromosome 4. Compelling evidence implicates 
impaired mitochondrial energetics, altered mitochondrial biogenesis and quality 
control, disturbed mitochondrial trafficking, oxidative stress and mitochondrial 
calcium dyshomeostasis in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Unfortunately, 
conventional mitochondrial-targeted molecules, such as cysteamine, creatine, 
coenzyme Q10, or triheptanoin, yielded negative or inconclusive results. 
However, future therapeutic strategies, aiming to restore mitochondrial 
biogenesis, improving the fission/fusion balance, and improving mitochondrial 
trafficking, could prove useful tools in improving the phenotype of Huntington's 
disease and, used in combination with genome-editing methods, could lead to a 
cure for the disease."
572,"Evidence from genetics and from analyzing cellular and animal models have 
converged to suggest links between neurodegenerative disorders of early and late 
life. Here, we summarize emerging links between the most common late life 
neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease, and the most common early life 
neurodegenerative diseases, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. Genetic studies 
reported an overlap of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and mutations in 
genes known to cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses. Accumulating data strongly 
suggest dysfunction of intracellular trafficking mechanisms and the 
autophagy-endolysosome system in both types of neurodegenerative disorders. This 
suggests shared cytopathological processes underlying these different types of 
neurodegenerative diseases. A better understanding of the common mechanisms 
underlying the different diseases is important as this might lead to the 
identification of novel targets for therapeutic concepts, the transfer of 
therapeutic strategies from one disease to the other and therapeutic approaches 
tailored to patients with specific mutations. Here, we review dysfunctions of 
the endolysosomal autophagy pathway in Alzheimer's disease and neuronal ceroid 
lipofuscinoses and summarize emerging etiologic and genetic overlaps."
573,"Parkinson's disease is the most common movement disorder, affecting about 1% of 
the population over the age of 60 years. Parkinson's disease is characterized 
clinically by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability, 
as a result of the progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. In 
addition to this neuronal cell loss, Parkinson's disease is characterized by the 
accumulation of intracellular protein aggregates, Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, 
composed primarily of the protein α-synuclein. Although it was first described 
almost 200 years ago, there are no disease-modifying drugs to treat patients 
with Parkinson's disease. In addition to conventional therapies, 
non-pharmacological treatment strategies are under investigation in patients and 
animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. Among such strategies, 
environmental enrichment, comprising physical exercise, cognitive stimulus, and 
social interactions, has been assessed in preclinical models of Parkinson's 
disease. Environmental enrichment can cause structural and functional changes in 
the brain and promote neurogenesis and dendritic growth by modifying gene 
expression, enhancing the expression of neurotrophic factors and modulating 
neurotransmission. In this review article, we focus on the current knowledge 
about the molecular mechanisms underlying environmental enrichment 
neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease, highlighting its influence on the 
dopaminergic, cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic systems, as well as the 
involvement of neurotrophic factors. We describe experimental pre-clinical data 
showing how environmental enrichment can act as a modulator in a neurochemical 
and behavioral context in different animal models of Parkinson's disease, 
highlighting the potential of environmental enrichment as an additional strategy 
in the management and prevention of this complex disease."
574,"Epigenetics focuses on DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin 
remodeling, noncoding RNAs, and other gene regulation mechanisms beyond the DNA 
sequence. In the past decade, epigenetic modifications have drawn more attention 
as they participate in the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy 
despite tight control of glucose levels. The underlying mechanisms of epigenetic 
modifications in diabetic retinopathy still urgently need to be elucidated. The 
diabetic condition facilitates epigenetic changes and influences target gene 
expression. In this review, we summarize the involvement of epigenetic 
modifications and metabolic memory in the development and progression of 
diabetic retinopathy and propose novel insights into the treatment of diabetic 
retinopathy."
575,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathies (CMT) constitute a group of common but highly 
heterogeneous, non-syndromic genetic disorders affecting predominantly the 
peripheral nervous system. CMT type 1A (CMT1A) is the most frequent type and 
accounts for almost ~50% of all diagnosed CMT cases. CMT1A results from the 
duplication of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Overexpression of 
PMP22 protein overloads the protein folding apparatus in Schwann cells and 
activates the unfolded protein response. This leads to Schwann cell apoptosis, 
dys- and de- myelination and secondary axonal degeneration, ultimately causing 
neurological disabilities. During the last decades, several different gene 
therapies have been developed to treat CMT1A. Almost all of them remain at the 
pre-clinical stage using CMT1A animal models overexpressing PMP22. The 
therapeutic goal is to achieve gene silencing, directly or indirectly, thereby 
reversing the CMT1A genetic mechanism allowing the recovery of myelination and 
prevention of axonal loss. As promising treatments are rapidly emerging, 
treatment-responsive and clinically relevant biomarkers are becoming necessary. 
These biomarkers and sensitive clinical evaluation tools will facilitate the 
design and successful completion of future clinical trials for CMT1A."
576,"Although mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 gene account for only a 
minority of total amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases, the discovery of this 
gene has been crucial for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research. Since the 
identification of superoxide dismutase 1 in 1993, the field of amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis genetics has considerably widened, improving our understanding 
of the diverse pathogenic basis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In this 
review, we focus on cognitive impairment in superoxide dismutase 1-amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis patients. Literature has mostly reported that cognition 
remains intact in superoxide dismutase 1-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, 
but recent reports highlight frontal lobe function frailty in patients carrying 
different superoxide dismutase 1-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutations. We 
thoroughly reviewed all the various mutations reported in the literature to 
contribute to a comprehensive database of superoxide dismutase 1-amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis genotype-phenotype correlation. Such a resource could 
ultimately improve our mechanistic understanding of amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, enabling a more robust assessment of how the amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis phenotype responds to different variants across genes, which is 
important for the therapeutic strategy targeting genetic mutations. Cognition in 
superoxide dismutase 1-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis deserves further 
longitudinal research since this peculiar frailty in patients with similar 
mutations can be conditioned by external factors, including environment and 
other unidentified agents including modifier genes."
577,"Alternative splicing is the process of producing variably spliced mRNAs by 
choosing distinct combinations of splice sites within a messenger RNA precursor. 
This splicing enables mRNA from a single gene to synthesize different proteins, 
which have different cellular properties and functions and yet arise from the 
same single gene. A family of splicing factors, Serine-arginine rich proteins, 
are needed to initiate the assembly and activation of the spliceosome. Serine 
and arginine rich splicing factor 1, part of the arginine/serine-rich splicing 
factor protein family, can either activate or inhibit the splicing of mRNAs, 
depending on the phosphorylation status of the protein and its interaction 
partners. Considering that serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 is either 
an activator or an inhibitor, this protein has been studied widely to identify 
its various roles in different diseases. Research has found that serine and 
arginine rich splicing factor 1 is a key target for neuroprotection, showing its 
promising potential use in therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders. 
Furthermore, serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 might be used to 
regulate cancer development and autoimmune diseases. In this review, we 
highlight how serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 has been studied 
concerning neuroprotection. In addition, we draw attention to how serine and 
arginine rich splicing factor 1 is being studied in cancer and immunological 
disorders, as well as how serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 acts 
outside the central or peripheral nervous system."
578,"Beta-defensin 20 (DEFB20) is widely expressed in the epididymis with gene 
features involved in epididymal sperm maturation. However, the action mechanism 
and function of DEFB20 in sperm maturation are still unclear. One of the 
important roles of beta-defensin is the ion channel activity. The cation channel 
sperm-associated protein (CatSper) alpha is an ion channel protein found on the 
sperm surface. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between DEFB20 
and CatSper1-4 protein in relation to the sperm maturation process. Protein 
sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information 
(NCBI). Protein modeling and validation were carried out by using the Robetta 
modeling server and the Ramachandran plot method. Rosetta web server was used 
for the docking analysis. The results revealed a natural interaction between 
DEFB20 and CatSper1-4. The interaction occurred at the cation channel (close to 
the casein kinase II), ion transport protein, and kinase c phosphorylation of 
the CatSper1-4 active site. The DEFB20 region interacting with CatSper2-4 was 
the beta-defensin domain, while with CatSper1 was the non-beta-defensin domain. 
Based on the analysis, DEFB20 may interact with CatSper α subunits, particularly 
CatsSper1, to affect ion channel activity during sperm maturation."
579,"Edwardsiella tarda (ET) and Edwardsiella anguillarum (EA) are the most harmful 
bacterial fish pathogens in Taiwan. However, there is confusion regarding the 
genotypic identification of E. tarda and E. piscicida (EP). Therefore, we used a 
novel Nanopore MinION MK1C platform to sequence and compare the complete genomes 
of E. piscicida and E. anguillarum. The number of coding genes, rRNA, and tRNA 
recorded for E. anguillarum and E. piscicida were 8322, 25, and 98, and 5458, 
25, and 98, respectively. Ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST) for 
E. piscicida indicated 35 rps. The shared clusters between E. anguillarum and 
E. piscicida indicated several unique clusters for the individual genomes. The 
phylogenetic tree analysis for all complete genomes indicated that 
E. anguillarum and E. piscicida were placed into two species-specific genotypes. 
Distribution of subsystems for annotated genomes found that genes related to 
virulence, defence, and disease for E. anguillarum were 103 and those for 
E. piscicida were 60 and pathogenic islands (PI) were 498 and 225, respectively. 
Vaccine candidates were identified in silico from the core genes using high 
antigenic, solubility, and secretion probabilities. Altogether, the genome data 
revealed distinctive features between E. anguillarum and E. piscicida, which 
suggest different pathogenicity and thus the need for separate preventive 
strategies."
580,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Drought reduces plant productivity, especially in the 
susceptible species Brassica napus. Water stress, mimicked by applications of 
10% polyethylene glycol (PEG), elevates nitric oxide (NO) in root cells after a 
few hours contributing to the degradation of the root apical meristems (RAMs), 
the function of which relies on auxin and brassinosteroids (BRs). Phytoglobins 
(Pgbs) are effective NO scavengers induced by the stress. This work examines the 
effects of BnPgb1 dysregulation in dehydrating B. napus roots, and the 
spatiotemporal relationship between Pgb1 and activities of auxin and BRs in the 
regulation of the RAM.
METHODS: B. napus lines over-expressing [BnPgb1(S)] or down-regulating 
[BnPgb1(RNAi)] BnPgb1 were exposed to polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced water 
stress. The localization of BnPgb1, NO, auxin and PIN1 were analyzed during the 
first 48h, while the expression level of biosynthetic auxin and BR genes was 
measured during the first 24h. Pharmacological treatments were conducted to 
assess the requirement of auxin and BR in dehydrating roots.
KEY RESULTS: During the stress, BnPgb1 protein accumulated preferentially in the 
peripheral domains of the root elongation zone, exposing the meristem to NO, 
which inhibits polar auxin transport (PAT), likely by interfering with PIN1 
localization and the synthesis of auxin. Diminished auxin at the root tip 
depressed the synthesis of BR and caused the degradation of the RAMs. The 
strength of BnPgb1 signal in the elongation zone was increased in BnPgb1(S) 
roots, where NO was confined to the most apical cells. Consequently, PAT and 
auxin synthesis were retained, and the definition of RAMs was maintained. The 
auxin preservation of the RAM required BRs, although BRs alone was not 
sufficient to fully rescue drought-damaged RAMs in auxin depleted environments.
CONCLUSIONS: The tissue-specific localization of BnPgb1 and NO are determinant 
for B. napus root response to water stress. A model is proposed where auxin and 
BRs act as downstream components of BnPgb1 signalling in the preservation of 
RAMs in dehydrating roots."
581,"Assays to evaluate the susceptibility of Simulium larvae to temephos and 
Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis (Bti) were carried out by setting-up an 
in vitro laboratory test ('bio assay') and a semi-natural test ('système de 
goutières') to assess the LC50/LC90 values. Larvae of Simulium species in 
Cameroon (S. damnosum s.l., S. hargreavesi, S. vorax and S. cervicornutum) and 
(S. (Odagmia) ornatum and S. latipes) in Germany were identified and tested. In 
the bio-assay, 50 larvae were exposed for 10 min to concentrations from 0.01 to 
10 ppm. For the Simulium from Germany, the LC50 (LC90) values after 3 and 6 h 
were 3.1 (27.9) and 0.14 (1.26) ppm for temephos and for Bti 7.8 (70.2) and 1.7 
(15.3) ppm, respectively. For Cameroonian species, the values of LC50 (LC90) 
were lower, that is, 0.42 (8.04), 0.14 (2.70) and 0.073 (1.38) ppm, 
respectively, after 3, 6 and 12 h for temephos. In a semi natural condition, the 
LC50 of 10 min of application of temephos was 0.84 ppm after 3 h and a working 
solution (2.6 L) of Bti killed 50% after 6 h. To detect an upcoming of any 
resistance as it happened in Ivory Coast, a study of the occurrence resistance 
genes should be implemented."
582,"BACKGROUND: Pathogenic mutations in the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain gene, 
MYH11, cause megacystis megacolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome and other 
forms of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Evaluation of intestinal tissues 
from affected patients is often performed before mutational analysis, but the 
pathological findings of MYH11-variant visceral myopathy have not been well 
defined.
METHODS: Light microscopic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural findings 
from multiple intestinal samples from 2 patients with MYH11-variant visceral 
myopathy were reviewed, including MYH11-specific immunohistochemistry. The 
findings were compared with intestinal samples from patients with gamma-smooth 
muscle actin (ACTG2)-variant visceral myopathy and non-pseudo-obstruction 
controls.
RESULTS: Apart from non-specific changes (e.g., muscle hypertrophy and 
distension-related muscularis propria necrosis), no alterations were identified 
by routine histopathological evaluation or electron microscopy. 
Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against a battery of smooth muscle 
proteins, including MYH11, revealed indistinguishable patterns of 
immunoreactivity in the muscularis propria of both patients and controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Myopathic morphological or immunohistochemical changes may not be 
present in intestinal specimens from patients with MYH11-variant visceral 
myopathy. Molecular genetic studies should be considered for patients with 
chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and normal or non-specific pathology 
findings."
583,"The immune response is crucial for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) 
progression, with the participation of proinflammatory cells and cytokines, 
inducing lung injury and loss of respiratory function. CLEC5A expression on 
monocytes can be triggered by viral and bacterial infections, leading to poor 
outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 is able to induce neutrophil activation by CLEC5A and 
Toll-like receptor 2, leading to an aggressive inflammatory cascade, but little 
information is known about the molecular interactions between CLEC5A and 
SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Here, we aimed to explore how CLEC5A expression could be 
affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection using immunological tools with in vitro, in 
vivo and in silico assays. The findings revealed that high levels of CLEC5A 
expression were found in monocytes from severe COVID-19 patients in comparison 
with mild COVID-19 and unexposed subjects, but not in vaccinated subjects who 
developed mild COVID-19. In hamsters, we detected CLEC5A gene expression during 
3-15 days of Omicron strain viral challenge. Our results also showed that CLEC5A 
can interact with SARS-CoV-2, promoting inflammatory cytokine production, 
probably through an interaction with the receptor binding domain in the 
N-acetylglucosamine binding site (NAG-601). The high expression of CLEC5A and 
high levels of proinflammatory cytokine production were reduced in vitro by a 
human CLEC5A monoclonal antibody. Finally, CLEC5A was triggered by spike 
glycoprotein, suggesting its involvement in COVID-19 progression; therapy with a 
monoclonal antibody could be a good strategy for COVID-19 treatment, but 
vaccines are still the best option to avoid hospitalization/deaths. This article

critical COVID-19). Genome-wide risk genes were compared between the GWAS 
datasets on hospitalized COVID-19 and MS. Literature-based analysis was 
conducted to construct molecular pathways connecting MS and COVID-19. The MR 
analyses indicated that genetic liability to MS confers a causal effect on 
hospitalized COVID-19 (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.03-1.16) but not on SARS-CoV-2 
infection (1.03, 1.00-1.05). Genetic liability to hospitalized COVID-19 confers 
a causal effect on MS (1.15, 1.02-1.30). Hospitalized COVID-19 and MS share five 
risk genes within two loci, including TNFAIP8, HSD17B4, CDC37, PDE4A, and KEAP1. 
Pathway analysis identified a panel of immunity-related genes that may mediate 
the links between MS and COVID-19. Our study suggests that MS was associated 
with a 9% increased risk for COVID-19 hospitalization, while hospitalized 
COVID-19 was associated with a 15% increased risk for MS. Immunity-related 
pathways may underlie the link between MS on COVID-19. This article is protected

585,"Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors carry a cassette of interest 
retaining only the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) from the wild-type virus. 
Conventional rAAV production primarily use a vector plasmid as well as helper 
genes essential for AAV replication and packaging. Nevertheless, plasmid 
backbone related contaminants have been a major source of vector heterogeneity. 
The mechanism driving the contamination phenomenon has yet to be elucidated. 
Here we identified cryptic resolution sites in the plasmid backbone as a key 
source for producing snapback genomes, which leads to the increase of vector 
genome heterogeneity in encapsidated virions. By using a single ITR plasmid as a 
model molecule and mapping subgenomic particles, we found that there exist a few 
typical DNA break hotspots in the vector DNA plasmid backbone, e. g. on the 
ampicillin DNA element, called aberrant rescue sites. DNA around these specific 
breakage sites may assume some typical secondary structures. Similar to normal 
AAV vectors, plasmid DNA with a single ITR was able to rescue and replicate 
efficiently. These subgenomic DNA species significantly compete for trans 
factors required for rAAV rescue, replication, and packaging. The replication of 
single ITR contaminants during AAV production is independent of size. Packaging 
of these species is greatly affected by its size. A single ITR and a cryptic 
resolution site in the plasmid work synergistically, likely causing a source of 
plasmid backbone contamination. This article is protected by copyright. All

586,"BACKGROUND: Lynch syndrome (LS), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
pathogenic germline variants in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, represents the 
most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome. Lynch syndrome patients 
are at high risk of CRC despite regular endoscopic surveillance.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the diagnostic performance of artificial 
intelligence (AI)-assisted colonoscopy in comparison to High-Definition 
white-light endoscopy (HD-WLE) for the first time.
METHODS: Patients ≥18 years with LS, with a pathogenic germline variant (MLH1, 
MHS2, MSH6), and at least one previous colonoscopy (interval 10-36 months) were 
eligible. Patients were stratified by previous CRC and affected MMR gene with a 
1:1 allocation ratio (AI-assisted vs. HD white-light endoscopy) in this 
exploratory pilot trial.
RESULTS: Between Dec-2021 and Dec-2022, 101 LS patients were randomised and 96 
patients were finally analyzed after exclusion of 5 patients due to insufficient 
bowel preparation. In the HD-WLE arm, adenomas were detected in 12/46 patients 
compared to 18/50 in the AI arm (26.1% [95% CI 14.3-41.1] vs. 36.0% [22.9-50.8]; 
p = 0.379). The use of AI-assisted colonoscopy especially increased detection of 
flat adenomas (Paris classification 0-IIb) (examinations with detected flat 
adenomas: 3/46 [6.5%] vs. 10/50 [20%]; p = 0.07; numbers of detected flat 
adenomas: 4/20 vs. 17/30, p = 0.018). The median withdrawal time did not differ 
significantly between HD-WLE and AI (14 vs. 15 min; p = 0.170).
CONCLUSION: We here present first data suggesting that real-time AI-assisted 
colonoscopy is a promising approach to optimize endoscopic surveillance in LS 
patients, in particular to improve the detection of flat adenomas."
587,"The current understanding of skin aging is that senescent fibroblasts accumulate 
within the dermis and subcutaneous fat to cause abnormal tissue remodeling and 
extracellular matrix dysfunction, triggering a senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype (SASP). A novel therapeutic approach to prevent skin aging is to 
specifically eliminate senescent dermal fibroblasts; this requires the 
identification of specific protein markers for senescent cells. Apolipoprotein D 
(ApoD) is involved in lipid metabolism and antioxidant responses and is 
abundantly expressed in tissues affected by age-related diseases such as 
Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. However, its behavior and role in skin 
aging remain unclear. In this study, we examined whether ApoD functions as a 
marker of aging using human dermal fibroblast aging models. In cellular 
senescence models induced via replicative aging and ionizing radiation exposure, 
ApoD expression was upregulated at the gene and protein levels and correlated 
with senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and the decreased uptake of 
the proliferation marker BrdU, which was concomitant with the upregulation of 
SASP genes. Furthermore, ApoD-positive cells were found to be more abundant in 
the aging human dermis using fluorescence flow cytometry. These results suggest 
that ApoD is a potential clinical marker for identifying aging dermal 
fibroblasts."
588,"Phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of macrophages is clearly a critical 
component of their effective functions in innate and adaptive immunity. This 
investigation hypothesized that altered profiles of gene expression in gingival 
tissues in health, disease and resolution would reflect changes in macrophage 
phenotypes occurring in these tissues. The study used a nonhuman primate model 
to evaluate gene expression profiles as footprints of macrophage variation using 
a longitudinal experimental model of ligature-induced periodontitis in animals 
from 3-23 years of age to identify aging effects on the gingival environment. 
Significant differences were observed in distribution of expressed gene levels 
for M0, M1 and M2 macrophages in healthy tissues with the younger animals 
showing the least expression. M0 gene expression increased with disease in all 
but the aged group, while M1 was increased in adult and young animals, and M2 in 
all age groups, as early as disease initiation (within 0.5 months). Numerous 
histocompatibility genes were increased with disease, except in the aged 
samples. An array of cytokines/chemokines representing both M1 and M2 cells were 
increased with disease showing substantial increases with disease initiation 
(eg. IL1A, CXCL8, CCL19, CCL2, CCL18), although the aged tissues showed a more 
limited magnitude of change across these macrophage genes. The analytics of 
macrophage genes at sites of gingival health, disease and resolution 
demonstrated distinct profiles of host response interactions that may help model 
the disease mechanisms occurring with the formation of a periodontal lesion."
589,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a member of the Cyclooxygenase family, initiates the 
biosynthesis of prostanoids that regulates various cellular functions. Our pilot 
attempt revealed that administration of etoricoxib, an inhibitor specific for 
COX-2, induces abnormal looping in the chicken heart. The present study attempts 
to reveal the mechanistic details of etoricoxibinduced abnormal cardiac looping. 
The activity of COX-2 was inhibited by administering 3.5 μg of etoricoxib into 
the air cell of the egg on day zero of incubation. The gene and protein 
expression patterns of the major mediators of heart development were then 
analyzed on day 2 (HH12) and day 3 (HH20). Reduction in the COX-2 activity 
deranged the expressions of upstream regulators of organogenesis like Wnt11, 
BMP4 and SHH in the embryos exposed to etoricoxib. The observed expression 
shifts in the downstream regulators of myocardial patterning (MYOCD, HAND2, 
GATA4, GATA5 and GATA6) in the treated embryos corroborate the above results. In 
addition, the reduction in COX-2 activity hampered the cardiomyocyte 
proliferation with a concomitant increase in the rate of apoptosis. In 
conclusion, the collective effect of altered expression of signaling molecules 
of myocardial patterning and compromised cardiomyocyte turnover rate could be 
the reason behind the looping defects observed in the heart of 
etoricoxib-treated chick embryos."
590,"Begomoviruses are a group of ssDNA viruses exclusively transmitted by the 
whitefly Bemisia tabaci and constrain vegetable production in the old and new 
worlds. Although multiple molecular determinants governing transmission of 
begomoviruses by whiteflies have been unraveled, factors critical for 
transmission majorly remain unknown. In this study, a whitefly C2H2 zinc finger 
(ZF) protein, 100% identical to the vascular endothelial zinc finger like gene 
(vezf) protein was confirmed to interact with the CP of both old- and new-world 
begomoviruses. This was achieved by a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system screening of 
a whitefly cDNA library using capsid protein (CP) of TYLCV as a bait. In silico 
annotation of vezf protein revealed that it contains a N-terminal zinc finger 
associated domain (ZAD) alongside multiple C2H2 ZF domains on the C-terminal 
end. ZAD-ZF proteins form the most abundant class of transcription factors 
within insects. Herein, we validated the interaction of vezf with four diverse 
begomoviruses and its functional role in begomovirus transmission. Silencing of 
the vezf gene of B. tabaci led to increased retention of three diverse 
begomoviruses tested. Vezf is the first insect transcription factor identified 
to interact with plant viruses and can be crucial to understand the possible 
mechanisms by which plant viruses modulate transcription of their insect vectors 
during transmission. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

591,"Two-step tests for gene-environment ( G × E ) interactions exploit marginal 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects to improve the power of a 
genome-wide interaction scan. They combine a screening step based on marginal 
effects used to ""bin"" SNPs for weighted hypothesis testing in the second step to 
deliver greater power over single-step tests while preserving the genome-wide 
Type I error. However, the presence of many SNPs with detectable marginal 
effects on the trait of interest can reduce power by ""displacing"" true 
interactions with weaker marginal effects and by adding to the number of tests 
that need to be corrected for multiple testing. We introduce a new 
significance-based allocation into bins for Step-2 G × E testing that overcomes 
the displacement issue and propose a computationally efficient approach to 
account for multiple testing within bins. Simulation results demonstrate that 
these simple improvements can provide substantially greater power than current 
methods under several scenarios. An application to a multistudy collaboration 
for understanding colorectal cancer reveals a G × Sex interaction located near 
the SMAD7 gene."
592,"Cohesin is a ring-shaped protein complex that comprises the SMC1, SMC3, and 
α-kleisin proteins, STAG1/2/3 subunits, and auxiliary factors. Cohesin 
participates in chromatin remodeling, chromosome segregation, DNA replication, 
and gene expression regulation during the cell cycle. Mitosis-specific α-kleisin 
factor RAD21 and meiosis-specific α-kleisin factor REC8 are expressed in 
embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to maintain pluripotency. Here, we demonstrated that 
RAD21 and REC8 were involved in maintaining genomic stability and modulating 
chromatin modification in murine ESCs. When the kleisin subunits were depleted, 
DNA repair genes were downregulated, thereby reducing cell viability and causing 
replication protein A (RPA) accumulation. This finding suggested that the repair 
of exposed single-stranded DNA was inefficient. Furthermore, the depletion of 
kleisin subunits induced DNA hypermethylation by upregulating DNA methylation 
proteins. Thus, we proposed that the cohesin complex plays two distinct roles in 
chromatin remodeling and genomic integrity to ensure the maintenance of 
pluripotency in ESCs."
593,"Today, cancer is one of the main health-related challenges, and in the meantime, 
breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women, with an 
alarming number of incidences and deaths every year. For this reason, the 
discovery of novel and more effective approaches for the diagnosis, treatment, 
and monitoring of the disease are very important. In this regard, scientists are 
looking for diagnostic molecules to achieve the above-mentioned goals with 
higher accuracy and specificity. RNA interference (RNAi) is a posttranslational 
regulatory process mediated by microRNA intervention and small interfering RNAs. 
After transcription and edition, these two noncoding RNAs are integrated and 
activated with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and AGO2 to connect the 
target mRNA by their complementary sequence and suppress their translation, thus 
reducing the expression of their target genes. These two RNAi categories show 
different patterns in different BC types and stages compared to healthy cells, 
and hence, these molecules have high diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic 
potentials. This article aims to review the RNAi pathway and diagnostic and 
therapeutic potentials with a special focus on BC."
594,"As the central cellular player in fibrogenesis, activated hepatic stellate cells 
(aHSCs) are the major target of antifibrotic nanomedicines. Based on our finding 
that activated HSCs increase the expression of folate receptor alpha (FRα), we 
tried to apply folic acid (FA) decoration to generate an active drug-targeting 
at aHSCs and suppress hepato-fibrogenesis. FA-conjugated poly(ethylene 
glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone) copolymers (PEG-PCL) were synthesized and 
self-assembled into the spherical micelles that owned a uniform size 
distribution averaging at 60 nm, excellent hemo- and cyto-compatibility, and 
pH-sensitive stability. These FA-modified micelles were preferentially ingested 
by aHSCs as expected and accumulated more in acutely CCl4 injured mouse livers 
compared to nondecorated counterparts. Such an aHSC targetability facilitated 
the loaded medicinal camptothecin (CPT) to achieve a greater therapeutic 
efficacy and inhibition of MF phenotypic genes in aHSCs. Encouragingly, though 
free CPT and nontargeting CPT micelles produced negligible curative outcomes, 
FA-decorated CPT micelles yielded effectively remedial effects in chronically 
CCl4-induced fibrotic mice, as represented by a significant shrinkage of aHSC 
population, suppression of fibrogenesis, and recovery of liver structure and 
function, clearly indicating the success of the folate decoration-supported 
aHSC-targeted strategy for antifibrotic nanomedicines in fibrosis resolution."
595,"The definition of autoimmune neutropenias (AIN) has been based on the 
demonstration of autoantibodies directed to various epitopes on blood 
neutrophils. However, this definition is probably too limited and excludes 
neutropenias (NPs) with a negative autoantibody test but with other phenomena 
that indicate an underlying autoimmune process. Examples of such AINs may be 
complete or incomplete systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases 
where NP is common but patients may not fulfill formal diagnostic criteria for a 
rheumatic disease. Recently, various inherited immune-dysregulation syndromes, 
such as those related to variants in, for example, TACI, BAFFR, ACKR1/DARC, 
LRBA, CTLA 4 genes, with dysregulated B- and T-lymphocyte functions, have been 
associated with concomitant AINs. Cellular immune mechanisms may also play a 
prominent role in the development of NP, in the presence or not of 
autoantibodies, in cases of large granular lymphocyte syndromes of T- and 
NK-cell types or in chronic idiopathic NP, particularly in adults with T-cell 
clonal populations. The course of AIN may differ according to age, being 
transient and rather uncomplicated in children, and chronic with treatment 
requirement in adolescents and adults. This review discusses current knowledge 
of AINs, including diagnostic procedures, treatments, and prognosis."
596,"The Southeast Asian box turtle, Cuora amboinensis, is an ecologically important 
endangered species which needs an onsite monitoring device to protect it from 
extinction. An electrochemical DNA biosensor was developed to detect the C. 
amboinensis mitochondrial cytochrome b gene based on an in silico designed probe 
using bioinformatics tools, and it was also validated in wet-lab experiments. As 
a detection platform, a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) enhanced with a 
nanocomposite containing gold nanoparticles and graphene was used. The 
morphology of the nanoparticles was analysed by field-emission scanning electron 
microscopy and structural characteristics were analysed by using 
energy-dispersive X-ray, UV-vis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. 
The electrochemical characteristics of the modified electrodes were studied by 
cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical 
impedance spectroscopy. The thiol-modified synthetic DNA probe was immobilised 
on modified SPCEs to facilitate hybridisation with the reverse complementary 
DNA. The turtle DNA was distinguished based on hybridisation-induced 
electrochemical change in the presence of methylene blue compared to their 
mismatches, noncomplementary, and nontarget species DNA measured by DPV. The 
developed biosensor exhibited a selective response towards reverse complementary 
DNAs and was able to discriminate turtles from other species. The modified 
electrode displayed good linearity for reverse complementary DNAs in the range 
of 1 × 10-11-5 × 10-6 M with a limit of detection of 0.85 × 10-12 M. This 
indicates that the proposed biosensor has the potential to be applied for the 
detection of real turtle species."
597,"Natural products are structurally highly diverse and exhibit a wide array of 
biological activities. As a result, they serve as an important source of new 
drug leads. Traditionally, natural products have been discovered by 
bioactivity-guided fractionation. The advent of genome sequencing technology has 
resulted in the introduction of an alternative approach towards novel natural 
product scaffolds: Genome mining. Genome mining is an in-silico natural product 
discovery strategy in which sequenced genomes are analyzed for the potential of 
the associated organism to produce natural products. Seemingly universal 
biosynthetic principles have been deciphered for most natural product classes 
that are used to detect natural product biosynthetic gene clusters using 
pathway-encoded conserved key enzymes, domains, or motifs as bait. Several 
generations of highly sophisticated tools have been developed for the 
biosynthetic rule-based identification of natural product gene clusters. Apart 
from these hard-coded algorithms, multiple tools that use machine learning-based 
approaches have been designed to complement the existing genome mining tool set 
and focus on natural product gene clusters that lack genes with conserved 
signature sequences. In this perspective, we take a closer look at 
state-of-the-art genome mining tools that are based on either hard-coded rules 
or machine learning algorithms, with an emphasis on the confidence of their 
predictions and potential to identify non-canonical natural product biosynthetic 
gene clusters. We highlight the genome mining pipelines' current strengths and 
limitations by contrasting their advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, we 
introduce two indirect biosynthetic gene cluster identification strategies that 
complement current workflows. The combination of all genome mining approaches 
will pave the way towards a more comprehensive understanding of the full 
biosynthetic repertoire encoded in microbial genome sequences."
598,"BACKGROUND: Several studies conducted in Europe have suggested a protective 
association between early-life farming exposures and childhood eczema or atopic 
dermatitis; few studies have examined associations in adults.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate associations between early-life exposures and eczema 
among 3217 adult farmers and farm spouses (mean age 62.8 years) in a 
case-control study nested within an US agricultural cohort.
METHODS: We used sampling-weighted logistic regression to estimate odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for associations between early-life 
exposures and self-reported doctor-diagnosed eczema (273 cases) and polytomous 
logistic regression to estimate ORs (95%CIs) for a 4-level outcome combining 
information on eczema and atopy (specific IgE≥0.35). Additionally, we explored 
genetic and gene-environment associations with eczema.
RESULTS: Although early-life farming exposures were not associated with eczema 
overall, several early-life exposures were associated with a reduced risk of 
having both eczema and atopy. Notably, results suggest stronger protective 
associations among individuals with both eczema and atopy than among those with 
either atopy alone or eczema alone. For example, ORs (95%CIs) for having a 
mother who did farm work while pregnant were 1.01 (0.60-1.69) for eczema alone 
and 0.80 (0.65-0.99) for atopy alone, but 0.54 (0.33-0.80) for having both 
eczema and atopy. A genetic risk score based on previously identified atopic 
dermatitis variants was strongly positively associated with eczema, and 
interaction testing suggested protective effects of several early-life farming 
exposures only in individuals at lower genetic risk.
CONCLUSIONS: In utero and childhood farming exposures are associated with 
decreased odds of having eczema with atopy in adults."
599,"The process of domestication has led to dramatic differences in behavioral 
traits between domestic dogs and gray wolves. Whole-genome research found that a 
class of putative positively selected genes were related to various aspects of 
learning and memory, such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression. In 
this study, we constructed a single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of the dog 
hippocampus to illustrate its cell types, cell lineage and molecular features. 
Using the transcriptomes of 105 057 nuclei from the hippocampus of a Beagle dog, 
we identified 26 cell clusters and a putative trajectory of oligodendrocyte 
development. Comparative analysis revealed a significant convergence between dog 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and putative positively selected genes 
(PSGs). Forty putative PSGs were DEGs in glutamatergic neurons, especially in 
Cluster 14, which is related to the regulation of nervous system development. In 
summary, this study provides a blueprint to understand the cellular mechanism of 
dog domestication."
600,"TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) is a ubiquitous environmental 
toxicant and a notable teratogenic agent for cleft palate (CP), a common 
congenital structural malformation that can result from abnormalities during 
palatal shelf connection and/or fusion. The development of the palate requires 
precise coordination between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. Exosomes are 
vesicles secreted by cells and participate in organ development by transferring 
various bioactive molecules between cells and regulating cell proliferation, 
migration, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT); these 
vesicles represent a new method of intercellular communication. To explore how 
TCDD could influence palatal cell behaviors and communication, we treated 
mesenchymal cells with TCDD, collected the exosomes secreted by the cells, 
assessed the 2 types of palatal cells, and then observed the effects of 
TCDD-induced exosomes. We found that the effects of TCDD-induced exosomes were 
equal to those of TCDD. Thus, TCDD might change the genetic materials of palatal 
cells and exosomes to cause dysregulated gene expression from parental cells, 
affect cellular information communicators, and induce abnormal cellular 
behaviors that could lead to CP."
601,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary fibrosis is considered to be an irreversible lung injury, 
which can be caused by paraquat (PQ) poisoning. MiRNAs have been demonstrated 
crucial roles in pulmonary fibrosis caused by numerous approaches including PQ 
induction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role and the 
underlying mechanism of miR-215 in PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
METHODS: The cell and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis were established 
through PQ intervention. Cell viability was performed to test by MTT assay. 
Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect COL1A1 expression and its location. 
The relationships among E2F1, miR-215-5p, and BMPR2 were validated by dual 
luciferase reporter gene assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA-binding 
protein immunoprecipitation. Lung morphology was evaluated by hematoxylin and 
eosin staining.
RESULTS: MiR-215-5p was upregulated in PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vitro 
and in vivo. MiR-215-5p silencing relieved PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis 
progression by enhancing cell viability and reducing the expression of 
fibrosis-related markers (COL1A1, COL3A1, and α-SMA). Mechanistically, 
miR-215-5p directly targeted BMRP2. BMPR2 knockdown abolished the suppressive 
effects of miR-215-5p knockdown on PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, 
E2F1 interacted with miR-215-5p promoter and positively regulated miR-215-5p 
expression. E2F1 downregulation reduced miR-215-5p level and promoted BMPR2 
level via regulating TGF-β/Smad3 pathway, and then suppressed PQ-induced 
pulmonary fibrosis, whereas these effects were compromised by miR-215-5p 
sufficiency.
CONCLUSION: MiR-215-5p was activated by E2F1 to repress BMPR2 expression and 
activate TGF-β/Smad3 pathway, which aggravated PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis 
progression. Targeting the E2F1/miR-215-5p/BMPR2 axis might be a new approach to 
alleviate PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis."
602,"Fipronil (FPN) is phenylpyrazole insecticide extensively used to control a wide 
variety of pests. Betanin (BET) is a natural colorant with promising antioxidant 
and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to investigate the potential 
protective effect of BET on FPN induced nephrotoxicity in adult male albino 
rats. Forty rats were assigned into 4 equal groups; Group I (Control); Group II 
(BET) received 20 mg/kg b.wt/day; Group III (FPN) received 4.8 mg/kg b.wt/day; 
and Group IV (BET/FPN). All treatments were given orally for 90 days. At the end 
of experiment, blood samples were collected for analysis of serum urea and 
creatinine. Kidneys were harvested for determination of kidney injury 
molecule-1(KIM-1) level; gene expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related 
factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 
(NQO-1); oxidative stress biomarkers including malondialdehyde (MDA), protein 
carbonyl content (PCC), catalase activity (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), 
and reduced glutathione (GSH). Histopathological examination and 
immunohistochemical investigation of Nrf2, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and 
caspase-3 were also undertaken. The results revealed kidney dysfunction, 
downregulation of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO-1 genes, redox imbalance, structural 
damage, decreased Nrf2 and increased NF-κB immune-expression, in addition to 
strong caspase-3 immunoreactivity in FPN-treated group. In the combined group, 
BET co-administration resulted in functional and structural amelioration, 
up-regulation of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO-1 genes, mitigation of redox imbalance, and 
strong anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. In conclusion, BET via 
activation of Nrf2-HO-1/NQO-1 pathway, exhibits beneficial antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects against FPN-induced nephrotoxicity."
603,"Deficient homozygosity of a variant maintained in a population suggests that the 
variant may be embryonic lethal. We examined whole genome sequence data from 675 
canids to investigate for variants with missing homozygosity and high predicted 
impact. Our analysis identified 45 variants, in 32 genes. However, further 
scrutiny of the sequence reads revealed that all but one of these variants were 
artifacts of the variant calling process when using CanFam3.1, a widely utilized 
canine reference genome. We demonstrate that the use of multiple, newer 
reference genomes could reduce artifacts and lead to more accurate variant 
identification."
604,"Antimicrobial and self-cleaning nanomaterial coatings have attracted significant 
research attention in recent years due to the growing global threat of 
infectious diseases, the emergence of new diseases such as COVID-19, and 
increases in healthcare-associated infections. Although there are many 
reportedly successful coating technologies, the evaluation of antimicrobial 
performance is primarily conducted under simple laboratory conditions without 
adequate testing under real environmental conditions that reflect practical use 
and more importantly, reveal unintended outcomes. Furthermore, there is no 
standardized evaluation methodology to assess the long-term stability or the 
consequences associated with coating deterioration, such as the ecological 
impacts of nanomaterials or the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria/genes. In this review, we propose a precautionary framework that 
integrates a rigorous assessment of potential risks and limitations of 
nanomaterial coatings for antimicrobial applications as intrinsic to a 
comprehensive evaluation of their benefits. In addition, we summarize some 
emerging coating technologies as promising strategies to minimize unintended 
risks and enhance performance."
605,"Objective: Worldwide, preeclampsia (PE) is a multifactorial disorder reported in 
2-5% of pregnancies, which increases mortality during pregnancy. In general, 
10-15% of maternal deaths are directly related to PE and eclampsia. One of the 
susceptibility genes for PE is tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expressed by most 
immune cells. TNF-α is a protein involved in various biological processes, 
including proliferation and apoptosis, as well as the expression of inflammatory 
genes. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of TNF-α single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -308G/A (rs1800629) and their relationship with 
TNF-α in PE patients. Materials and methods: The SNP was genotyped in 90 cases 
and 90 controls. Whole blood was collected from women with PE and normal 
pregnancy in EDTA containing tubes, and DNA extraction was performed from their 
blood lymphocytes according to a standard phenol-chloroform procedure. Then, DNA 
was genotyped by real-time PCR and the polymorphism was detected by TaqMan 
assay. Serum levels of TNF-α protein were measured by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent (ELISA) assay. Results: TNF-α levels in women with PE were 
significantly higher than in healthy ones (p<0.001). We did not observe any 
correlation between allelic outbreak (p=0.3) and TNF-α-308G/A polymorphism 
(p=0.7) with the incidence of PE. Conclusion: Although TNF-α-308G/A gene 
polymorphism does not appear to affect susceptibility to PE, an increased level 
of serum TNF-α can be used as a predictor for PE during pregnancy. We recommend 
that more research be conducted on possible factors related to the incidence of 
PE."
606,"Adult molluscs produce shells with diverse morphologies and ornamentations, 
different colour patterns and microstructures. The larval shell, however, is a 
phenotypically more conserved structure. How do developmental and evolutionary 
processes generate varying diversity at different life-history stages within a 
species? Using live imaging, histology, scanning electron microscopy and 
transcriptomic profiling, we have described shell development in a 
heteroconchian bivalve, the Antarctic clam, Laternula elliptica, and compared it 
to adult shell secretion processes in the same species. Adult downstream shell 
genes, such as those encoding extracellular matrix proteins and 
biomineralization enzymes, were largely not expressed during shell development. 
Instead, a development-specific downstream gene repertoire was expressed. 
Upstream regulatory genes such as transcription factors and signalling molecules 
were largely conserved between developmental and adult shell secretion. 
Comparing heteroconchian data with recently reported pteriomorphian larval shell 
development data suggests that, despite being phenotypically more conserved, the 
downstream effectors constituting the larval shell 'tool-kit' may be as diverse 
as that of adults. Overall, our new data suggest that a larval shell formed 
using development-specific downstream effector genes is a conserved and 
ancestral feature of the bivalve lineage, and possibly more broadly across the 
molluscs."
607,"Multi-nucleotide variants (MNVs) are defined as clusters of two or more nearby 
variants existing on the same haplotype in an individual. Recent studies have 
identified millions of MNVs in human populations, but their functions remain 
largely unknown. Numerous studies have demonstrated that single-nucleotide 
variants could serve as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) by affecting molecular 
phenotypes. Therefore, we propose that MNVs can also affect molecular phenotypes 
by influencing regulatory elements. Using the genotype data from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first identified 223 759 unique MNVs in 33 cancer types. 
Then, to decipher the functions of these MNVs, we investigated the associations 
between MNVs and six molecular phenotypes, including coding gene expression, 
miRNA expression, lncRNA expression, alternative splicing, DNA methylation and 
alternative polyadenylation. As a result, we identified 1 397 821 cis-MNVQTLs 
and 402 381 trans-MNVQTLs. We further performed survival analysis and identified 
46 173 MNVQTLs associated with patient overall survival. We also linked the 
MNVQTLs to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data and identified 119 762 
MNVQTLs that overlap with existing GWAS loci. Finally, we developed 
Pancan-MNVQTLdb (http://gong_lab.hzau.edu.cn/mnvQTLdb/) for data retrieval and 
download. Pancan-MNVQTLdb will help decipher the functions of MNVs in different 
cancer types and be an important resource for genetic and cancer research."
608,"OBJECTIVE: To report a unique case of total fertilization failure (TFF) after 
in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection related to 
homozygous WEE2 gene mutation and summarize the current literature and 
management of TFF.
DESIGN: Case report.
SETTING: Academic fertility center.
PATIENTS: A 25-year-old woman and her 35-year-old partner with a history of 
near-complete fertilization failure after 2 cycles of in vitro 
fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection.
INTERVENTIONS: Consultation with medical and commercial genetic testing for 
WEE2, PLCZ1, and TLE6.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Oocyte fertilization.
RESULTS: The patient was homozygous for WEE2 pathogenic variant impacting oocyte 
activation and resulting in infertility.
CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of TFF, early consideration should be given to 
genetic testing to assist couples in clinical decision-making and help limit the 
financial and emotional burden associated with unsuccessful fertility 
intervention."
609,"The herpetofauna of the Indomalayan bioregion of Asia suffers from severe 
habitat loss, unsustainable harvesting, and lack of research and conservation. 
Here, we investigated the range-wide phylogeography of the endangered ""eyed"" 
turtles (genus Sacalia, including the Beale's Eyed Turtle S. bealei and the 
Four-eyed Turtle S. quadriocellata) and discovered a natural interspecific 
hybrid turtle population in China. Based on phylogeny of the mitochondrial 
Cytochrome b gene of 101 samples in this study and public data, three major 
clades and six subclades were identified: S. bealei (SBE) in eastern-southern 
China, east S. quadriocellata in South China (northern east [SQUen] and southern 
east [SQUes] subclades), and west S. quadriocellata mainly in Vietnam (northern 
west [SQUwn], central west [SQUwc], and southern west [SQUws] subclades). We 
sequenced 16 nuclear DNA loci of 87 samples from SBE, SQUen, SQUes, and SQUwn 
subclades. Population genetic clustering analysis suggested a structure similar 
to the mitochondrial phylogeny, where most samples were classified into four 
genetic clusters corresponding to the four mtDNA subclades. However, a 
proportion of samples carrying SQUen mtDNA haplotypes formed an additional 
distinct cluster SHY. Those samples are found in the contact zone of the two 
species bearing mosaic and intermediate morphological characteristics. We 
detected an admixed ancestry in SHY from SBE and SQUen that conformed to an 
intrapopulation breeding scenario for at least hundreds of generations after the 
initial hybrid event, leading to a conclusion that SHY is a distinct and 
near-panmictic population derived from natural interspecific hybridization. In 
addition, SQUes (Hainan Island endemic) is of special concern due to significant 
isolation and low genetic diversity. We suggest that seven evolutionarily 
significant units should be recognized to facilitate appropriate conservation 
actions. These findings also highlight the urgent need for further 
herpetological research and conservation in this region."
610,"The fiddler crab Tubuca arcuata (Crustacea: Ocypodidae: Gelasiminae) is widely 
distributed across East Asia and northern Vietnam. Particularly, this species 
inhabits estuarine mangroves and mudflats of the East Asian continent, as well 
as the main islands of Japan and the Ryukyus. By comparing sequences of the 
mitochondrial 16S, cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), and control region genes, 
two main clades of this species were elucidated. The northern (N) clade was 
mostly restricted to the region north of the Taiwan Strait, whereas the wide (W) 
clade could be found throughout the entire range inhabited by this species. 
Based on the distribution of the ancestral haplotypes of COI and the divergence 
time of the two clades, our findings suggest that the land bridge barrier 
present in the Taiwan Strait during glaciations might have played an important 
role in their cladogenesis, approximately 0.93 million years ago. Here, we 
propose that the distribution of the ancestral haplotype of the W clade in the 
Ryukyus and the main islands of Japan was determined by the Paleo-Kuroshio 
Current, whereas the modern distribution pattern is shaped by the modern 
Kuroshio Current and other warm currents during the crab reproduction season in 
the summer."
611,"Most fiddler crabs have an extended planktonic larval phase, potentially 
maintaining gene flow among widely separated populations, in the absence of 
marine barriers. Such marine barriers could be long coastal stretches without 
suitable habitat, freshwater plumes caused by large river mouths, or strong 
currents. Typically, fiddler crabs inhabit mangrove habitats, and as mangroves 
tend to have a patchy distribution, it is important to gather information on the 
connectivity between neighboring mangroves and recognize local endemisms. To 
detect potential genetic differentiation among mangrove-dwelling populations of 
Leptuca thayeri and Uca maracoani along several thousand kilometers of a 
tropical coastline, mtDNA sequences of different populations from Brazil and two 
Caribbean islands were analyzed and compared. As shown in previous studies with 
fiddler crabs, Brazilian populations are genetically indiscernible, and our data 
suggest the absence of long-standing gene flow barriers in the two studied 
species along the Brazilian coast. This includes both sides of the postulated 
biogeographic barriers corresponding to the split of the Central South 
Equatorial Current and to the Amazon River freshwater plume. In contrast, 
conspecific individuals from the Greater Antilles carried different haplotypes, 
suggesting a biogeographical barrier between Brazil and the Caribbean, 
apparently having limited gene flow between both regions for extended time 
periods."
612,"Tubastraea is a genus of azooxanthellate scleractinian corals belonging to the 
family Dendrophylliidae, which are commonly called sun corals. This genus 
currently has only seven recognized species. In this paper, we report three new 
species of Tubastraea, including T. dendroida sp. nov., which has a tree-like 
colony, T. violacea sp. nov., which has violet polyps, and T. chloromura sp. 
nov., which has olive green polyps. These species are distinct in their septal 
structures, as well as their rDNA sequences including the entire ITS1, 5.8S and 
ITS2, and a segment of the 18S and 28S genes."
613,"Xeruca formosensis is a species and genus of fiddler crab endemic to Taiwan, 
with limited distribution in western Taiwan and the offshore Penghu Islands. 
This study reports the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of this 
species using next-generation sequencing. The mitogenome contains 15,684 bp, 
comprising 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNAs, 2 ribosomal RNAs and a 750-bp 
intergenic space (control region). The nucleotide composition is biased toward 
A+T (69.4%). A phylogenetic analysis based on the concatenated protein-coding 
genes showed that the genera Xeruca Shih, 2015 and Tubuca Bott, 1973 are sister 
to each other. In addition, the phylogeny of the 16 available mitogenomes in the 
family Ocypodidae also supports the current systematics of this family based on 
one nuclear and two mitochondrial markers. As this species inhabits high 
intertidal mudflats with high temperature and high salinity, mitogenome analyses 
may help us understand the mechanisms of adaptation to extreme environments, as 
well as the connectivity of metapopulations based on mitogenomes from different 
populations."

617,"Elite upland rice cultivars have the advantages of less water requirement along 
with high yield but are usually susceptible to various diseases. Rice blast 
caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is the most devastating disease in rice. 
Identification of new sources of resistance and the introgression of major 
resistance genes into elite cultivars are required for sustainable rice 
production. In this study, an upland rice genotype UR0803 was considered an 
emerging source of blast resistance. An F2 mapping population was developed from 
a cross between UR0803 and a local susceptible cultivar Lijiang Xintuan Heigu. 
The individuals from the F2 population were evaluated for leaf blast resistance 
in three trials 7 days after inoculation. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) by 
high-throughput sequencing and SNP-index algorithm was performed to map the 
candidate region related to disease resistance trait. A major quantitative trait 
locus (QTL) for leaf blast resistance was identified on chromosome 11 in an 
interval of 1.61-Mb genomic region. The candidate region was further shortened 
to a 108.9-kb genomic region by genotyping the 955 individuals with 14 SNP 
markers. Transcriptome analysis was further performed between the resistant and 
susceptible parents, yielding a total of 5044 differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs). There were four DEGs in the candidate QTL region, of which, two 
(Os11g0700900 and Os11g0704000) were upregulated and the remaining (Os11g0702400 
and Os11g0703600) were downregulated in the susceptible parent after 
inoculation. These novel candidate genes were functionally annotated to 
catalytic response against disease stimulus in cellular membranes. The results 
were further validated by a quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The 
fine-mapping of a novel QTL for blast resistance by integrative BSA mapping and 
transcriptome sequencing enhanced the genetic understanding of the mechanism of 
blast resistance in upland rice. The most suitable genotypes with resistance 
alleles would be useful genetic resources in rice blast resistance breeding."
618,"INTRODUCTION: The diagnosis of rare forms of α-thalassemia requires laborious 
genetic analyses. Accurate sample selection for such evaluation is therefore 
essential. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the predictive 
power of red blood cell parameters to detect rare forms of α-thalassemia 
(substudy 1), and to explore the frequency of rare versus common forms of 
α-thalassemia in our sample population (substudy 2).
METHODS: In substudy 1, we reviewed all blood samples selected for extended 
α-hemoglobinopathy evaluation at our laboratory during 2011-2020 (n = 1217), 
which included DNA sequencing and/or copy number variation analysis. We assessed 
α-thalassemia positive samples at different levels of mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin (MCH) alone and in combination with results for red blood cell count 
(RBC) or red cell distribution width (RDW). In substudy 2, we examined the 
distribution of α-thalassemia genotypes for all samples submitted to a 
first-tier hemoglobinopathy evaluation at our laboratory during 2014-2020 
(n = 6495).
RESULTS: In substudy 1, both RBC and RDW added predictive value in detecting 
rare forms of α-thalassemia in samples from adults and children. In adult 
samples with MCH ≤ 23 pg, the presence of erythrocytosis increased the detection 
rate from 27% to 74% as compared to non-erythrocytosis, while normal RDW 
increased the detection rate from 36% to 86% as compared to elevated RDW. In 
substudy 2, rare forms of α-thalassemia were detected in 12% of α-thalassemia 
positive samples.
CONCLUSION: Initial assessment of MCH, RBC, and RDW provided valuable predictive 
information about the presence of rare forms of α-thalassemia during 
hemoglobinopathy evaluation."
619,"Exercise has been shown to be beneficial in reducing symptoms of affective 
disorders and to increase the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF). The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with reduced 
activity-dependent BDNF release and increased risk for anxiety and depression. 
Male and female Val66Met rats were given access to running wheels from 3 weeks 
of age and compared to sedentary controls. Anxiety- and depression-like 
behaviors were measured in adulthood using the elevated plus maze (EPM), open 
field (OF), and forced swim test (FST). Expression of BDNF and a number of 
stress-related genes, the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1), 
serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (Sgk1), and FK506 binding protein 51 
(Fkbp5) in the hippocampus were also measured. Rats given access to running 
wheels developed high levels of voluntary exercise, decreased open-arm time on 
the EPM and center-field time in the OF, reduced overall exploratory activity in 
the open field, and increased immobility time in the FST with no differences 
between genotypes. Chronic exercise induced a significant increase in Bdnf mRNA 
and BDNF protein levels in the hippocampus with some of these effects being 
genotype specific. Exercise decreased the expression of Nr3c1 and Sgk1, but 
increased the expression of Fkbp5. These results suggest that chronic 
running-wheel exercise from adolescence increased anxiety and depression-like 
phenotypes in adulthood, independent of BDNF Val66Met genotype. Further studies 
are required to confirm that increased indices of anxiety-like behavior are 
independent from reduced overall locomotor activity."
620,"Environmental pollution can result in poor sperm quality either directly or 
indirectly in birds. However, adaptive and compensatory sperm morphology changes 
and motility improvements have rapidly evolved in tree sparrows (Passer 
montanus) inhabiting polluted areas over the past 65 years. To identify the 
genetic underpinnings of the rapidly evolving sperm phenotype, we carried out 
population genomics and transcriptomics on tree sparrow populations in the two 
differently polluted places. We identified a gene encoding the serine/threonine 
protein kinase PIM1, which may drive rapid phenotypic evolution of sperm. An 
unprecedented and remarkable expansion of the PIM gene family, caused by tandem 
and segmental duplication of PIM1, was subsequently observed in the tree sparrow 
genome. Most PIM1 duplicates showed a testis-specific expression pattern, 
suggesting that their functions are related to male reproduction. Furthermore, 
the elevated expression level of PIM1 was consistent with our earlier findings 
of longer and faster swimming sperm in polluted sites, indicating an important 
role for duplicated PIM1 in facilitating the rapid evolution of sperm. Our 
results suggest that duplicated PIM1 provides sources of genetic variation that 
may enable the rapid evolution of sperm under environmental heavy metal 
pollution. The findings of this study indicated that duplicated genes can be 
targets of selection and predominant sources for rapid adaptation to 
environmental change and shed light on sperm evolution under pollution stress."
621,"Disentangling the interaction between the genetic basis and environmental 
context underlying phenotypic variation is critical for understanding organismal 
evolution. Environmental change, such as increased rates of urbanization, can 
induce shifts in phenotypic plasticity with some individuals adapting to city 
life while others are displaced. A key trait that can facilitate adaptation is 
the degree at which animals respond to stressors. This stress response, which 
includes elevation of baseline circulating concentrations of glucocorticoids, 
has a heritable component and exhibits intra- and inter-individual variation. 
However, the mechanisms behind this variability and whether they might be 
responsible for adaptation to different environments are not known. Variation in 
DNA methylation can be a potential mechanism that mediates environmental effects 
on the stress response, as early-life stressors increase glucocorticoid 
concentrations and change adult phenotype. We used an inter- and 
intra-environmental cross-foster experiment to analyze the contribution of DNA 
methylation to early-life phenotypic variation. We found that at hatching, urban 
house wren (Troglodytes aedon) offspring had higher methylation frequencies as 
compared to their rural counterparts. We also observed age-related patterns in 
offspring methylation, indicating developmental effects of the rearing 
environment on methylation. At fledgling, differential methylation analyses 
showed that cellular respiration genes were differentially methylated in broods 
of different origins and behavioral and metabolism genes were differentially 
methylated in broods of different rearing environments. Lastly, 
hyper-methylation of a single gene (CNTNAP2) is associated with decreased 
glucocorticoid levels and the rearing environment. These differential 
methylation patterns linked to a specific physiological phenotype suggest that 
DNA methylation may be a mechanism by which individuals adjust to novel 
environments during their lifespan. Characterizing genetic and environmental 
influences on methylation is critical for understanding the role of epigenetic 
mechanisms in evolutionary adaptation."
622,"Nitrogen (N) is an essential element required for sugar beet growth. Sugar beets 
with low N (LN) tolerance and high N use efficiency are excellent materials for 
breeding. Here, we comprehensively evaluated the morphological and physiological 
responses of nine sugar beet genotypes to LN supply. It was found that 
0.5 mmol·L-1 N (LN) significantly influenced the performance of leaves and the 
topology of roots by reducing the bioproduction of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and 
soluble protein (SP) and the accumulation of N in leaves and roots (LNA and 
RNA), thus differentially restricting the growth (hypocotyl diameter, HD; root 
length, RL) and biomass (leaf and root fresh weight; LFW and RFW; leaf dry 
weight, LDW) of these sugar beets. Principal component and cluster analyses 
showed that 780016B/12 superior (F) exhibited excellent tolerance to LN; it had 
higher SOD activity (62.70%) and APX activity (188.92%) and a higher proline 
content (131.82%) than 92011 (G, LN sensitive). These attributes helped 
780016B/12 superior (F) to better endure LN stress, and the morphology and N 
distribution changed to adapt to N deficiency, such that the root length 
increased by 112.48%, leaf area increased by 101.23%, and leaf nitrogen 
accumulation reached a peak of 14.13 g/plant. It seems that LN-tolerant 
genotypes increased their root length and surface area by reducing the 
difference in biomass, thereby expanding the contact between roots and soil, 
which was conducive to the absorption of nutrients (N) by sugar beets and helped 
distribute more assimilation products to the roots."
623,"Cancer is a major threat to human health today. Although the existing anticancer 
treatments have effectively improved the prognosis of some patients, there are 
still other patients who cannot benefit from these well-established strategies. 
Reprogramming of lipid metabolism is one of the typical features of cancers. 
Recent studies have revealed that key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism may 
be effective anticancer therapeutic targets, but the development of therapeutic 
lipid metabolism targets is still insufficient. ECHS1 (enoyl-CoA hydratase, 
short chain 1) is a key enzyme mediating the hydration process of mitochondrial 
fatty acid β-oxidation and has been observed to be abnormally expressed in a 
variety of cancers. Therefore, with ECHS1 and cancer as the main keywords, we 
searched the relevant studies of ECHS1 in the field of cancer in Pubmed, 
summarized the research status and functions of ECHS1 in different cancer 
contexts, and explored its potential regulatory mechanisms, with a view to 
finding new therapeutic targets for anti-metabolic therapy. By reviewing and 
summarizing the retrieved literatures, we found that ECHS1 regulates malignant 
biological behaviors such as cell proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis, 
autophagy, and drug resistance by remodeling lipid metabolism and regulating 
intercellular oncogenic signaling pathways. Not only that, ECHS1 exhibits early 
diagnostic and prognostic value in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and 
small-molecule inhibitors that regulate ECHS1 also show therapeutic significance 
in preclinical studies. Taken together, we propose that ECHS1 has the potential 
to serve as a therapeutic target of lipid metabolism."

625,"OBJECTIVE: To screen transcription factor genes related to the prognosis of 
adult patients with sepsis.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients with sepsis and ten healthy individuals admitted 
for RNA-seq. Differential factors were enriched by four transcription factor 
databases, and survival analysis was adopted for core factors. Then, target 
genes were submitted to STRING to constitute the PPI network. Single-cell 
technology was used to localize cell lines. Finally, a transcription-target gene 
regulation network was constituted.
RESULTS: A total of 4,224 DEGs were obtained between sepsis and NC groups. PPI 
results showed that FOXO3, NFKB1, SPI1, STAT5A, and PPARA were located in the 
center of the network. Target genes were related to cytokine-mediated signaling 
pathway and transcription regulator activity, etc. SPI1 was mainly located in 
monocyte cell lines, while FOXO3, PPARA, SP1, STAT3, and USF1 were expressed in 
monocyte cell lines, NK-T cell lines, and B cell lines. Compared with those in 
the control group, FOXO3, SP1, SPI1, STAT3, and USF1 were highly expressed in 
the sepsis group, while PPARA had low expression.
CONCLUSION: Transcription factors such as FOXO3, PPARA, SP1, SPI1, STAT3, and 
USF1 are correlated with the prognosis of sepsis patients and thus may have a 
potential research value.Clinical Trial Registration: The clinical trial 
registration number is ChiCTR1900021261."
626,"Soil salinity is an important determinant of crop productivity and triggers salt 
stress response pathways in plants. The salt stress response is controlled by 
transcriptional regulatory networks that maintain regulatory homeostasis through 
combinations of transcription factor (TF)-DNA and TF-TF interactions. We 
investigated the transcriptome of poplar 84 K (Populus alba × Populus 
glandulosa) under salt stress using samples collected at 4 or 6 h intervals 
within 2 days of salt stress treatment. We detected 24,973 differentially 
expressed genes, including 2,231 TFs that might be responsive to salt stress. To 
explore these interactions and targets of TFs in perennial woody plants, we 
combined gene regulatory network, DNA affinity purification sequencing 
(DAP-seq), yeast two-hybrid-sequencing (Y2H-seq), and multi-gene association 
approaches. Growth-regulating factor 15 (PagGRF15) and its target, high-affinity 
K+ transporter 6 (PagHAK6), were identified as an important regulatory module in 
the salt stress response. Overexpression of PagGRF15 and PagHAK6 in transgenic 
lines improved salt tolerance by enhancing Na+ transport and modulating H2O2 
accumulation in poplar. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays identified more than 420 
PagGRF15-interacting proteins, including ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (ERF) TFs and 
a zinc finger protein (C2H2) that are produced in response to a variety of 
phytohormones and environmental signals and are likely involved in abiotic 
stress. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that PagGRF15 is a multifunctional 
TF involved in growth, development and salt stress tolerance, highlighting the 
capability of a multifaceted approach in identifying regulatory nodes in plants."
627,"Accumulation of incompletely folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
leads to ER stress, activates ER protein degradation pathways, and upregulates 
genes involved in protein folding. This process is known as the unfolded protein 
response (UPR). The role of ER protein folding in plant responses to nutrient 
deficiencies is unclear. We analyzed Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants 
affected in ER protein quality control and established that both CALNEXIN (CNX) 
genes function in the primary root's response to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. CNX1 
and CNX2 are homologous ER lectins promoting protein folding of N-glycosylated 
proteins via the recognition of the GlcMan9GlcNAc2 glycan. Growth of cnx1-1 and 
cnx2-2 single mutants was similar to that of the wild type under high and low Pi 
conditions, but the cnx1-1 cnx2-2 double mutant showed decreased primary root 
growth under low Pi conditions due to reduced meristematic cell division. This 
phenotype was specific to Pi deficiency; the double mutant responded normally to 
osmotic and salt stress. Expression of CNX2 mutated in amino acids involved in 
binding the GlcMan9GlcNAc2 glycan failed to complement the cnx1-1 cnx2-2 mutant. 
The root growth phenotype was Fe dependent and was associated with root 
apoplastic Fe accumulation. Two genes involved in Fe-dependent inhibition of 
primary root growth under Pi deficiency, the ferroxidase LOW PHOSPHATE 1 (LPR1) 
and P5-type ATPase PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE 2 (PDR2) were epistatic to 
CNX1/CNX2. Overexpressing PDR2 failed to complement the cnx1-1 cnx2-2 root 
phenotype. The cnx1-1 cnx2-2 mutant showed no evidence of UPR activation, 
indicating a limited effect on ER protein folding. CNX might process a set of 
N-glycosylated proteins specifically involved in the response to Pi deficiency."
628,"Many etiological factors causing short stature have already been identified in 
humans. In the last few years, the advent of new techniques for the detection of 
chromosomal and molecular abnormalities has made it possible to better identify 
patients with genetic causes of growth failure. Some of these factors directly 
affect the development and growth of the skeleton, since they damage the 
epiphyseal growth plate, where linear growth occurs, influencing chondrogenesis. 
In particular, defects in genes involved in the organization and function of the 
growth plate are responsible for several well-known conditions with short 
stature. These genes play a pivotal role in various mechanisms involving the 
extracellular matrix, intracellular signaling, paracrine signaling, endocrine 
signaling, and epigenetic regulation. In this review, we will discuss the genes 
involved in extracellular matrix disorders. The identification of genetic 
defects in linear growth failure is important for clinicians and researchers in 
order to improve the care of children affected by growth disorders."
629,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a genetically heterogeneous group of 
peripheral neuropathies most of which are associated with mutations in four 
genes including peripheral myelin protein-22 (PMP22), myelin protein zero (MPZ), 
gap junction protein beta1 (GJB1) and mitofusin2 (MFN2). This current case 
report describes the clinical and genetic characteristics of a 6-year-old male 
proband. A physical examination revealed muscular hypotonia. He started walking 
on his own at 18 months. A nerve conduction study with needle electromyography 
revealed conduction block. A novel MPZ mutation (c.398C > T, p.Pro133Leu) was 
revealed in the proband. This mutation was also found in the 32-year-old father 
of the proband. The father had had deformity of the feet and distal muscle 
weakness since childhood. The novel p.Pro133Leu pathogenic mutation was 
responsible for early onset but slowly progressive CMT1B. We assume that this 
site is an intolerant to change region in the MPZ gene. This variant in the MPZ 
gene is an important contributor to hereditary neuropathy with reduced nerve 
conduction velocity in the Russian population. This case highlights the 
importance of whole exome sequencing for a proper clinical diagnosis of CMT 
associated with a mutation in the MPZ gene."
630,"Prochlorococcus play a crucial role in the ocean's biogeochemical cycling, but 
it remains controversial how they will respond to global warming. Here we 
assessed the response to temperature (22-30°C) of the growth dynamics and gene 
expression profiles of a Red Sea Prochlorococcus strain (RSP50) in a non-axenic 
culture. Both the specific growth rate (0.55 - 0.80 d-1 ) and cell size (0.04 to 
0.07 μm3 ) of Prochlorococcus increased significantly with temperature. The 
primary production released extracellularly ranged from 20 to 34%, with 
humic-like fluorescent compounds increasing up to 5-fold as Prochlorococcus 
reached its maximum abundance. At 30°C, genes involved in carbon fixation such 
as CsoS2 and CsoS3 and photosynthetic electron transport including PTOX were 
downregulated, suggesting a cellular homeostasis and energy saving mechanism 
response. In contrast, PTOX was found upregulated at 22 and 24°C. Similar 
results were found for transaldolase, related to carbon metabolism, and citrate 
synthase, an important enzyme in the TCA cycle. Our data suggest that in spite 
of the currently warm temperatures of the Red Sea, Prochlorococcus can modulate 
its gene expression profiles to permit growth at temperatures lower than its 
optimum temperature (28°C) but is unable to cope with temperatures exceeding 
30°C. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
631,"BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) ranks second in mortality among all malignant 
diseases worldwide. However, the cause and molecular mechanism underlying 
gastric cancer are not clear. Here, we used integrated bioinformatics to 
identify possible key genes and reveal the pathogenesis and prognosis of gastric 
cancer.
METHODS: The gene expression profiles of GSE118916, GSE79973, and GSE29272 were 
available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) between GC and normal gastric tissues were screened by R 
software and Venn diagram software. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment of DEGs was 
performed using the DAVID database. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
was established by STRING and visualized using Cytoscape software. Then the 
influence of hub genes on expression and survival was assessed using TCGA 
database.
RESULTS: A total of 83 DEGs were found in the three datasets, including 41 
up-regulated genes and 42 down-regulated genes. These DEGs were mainly enriched 
in extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion. The enriched pathways 
obtained in the KEGG pathway analysis were extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor 
interaction and focal adhesion. A PPI network of DEGs was analyzed using the 
Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) app of Cytoscape. Four genes were considered 
hub genes, including COL5A1, FBN1, SPARC, and LUM. Among them, LUM was found to 
have a significantly worse prognosis based on TCGA database.
CONCLUSIONS: We screened DEGs associated with GC by integrated bioinformatics 
analysis and found one potential biomarker that may be involved in the progress 
of GC. This hub gene may serve as a guide for further molecular biological 
experiments."
632,"The widespread spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in hyporheic zone 
(HZ) has become an emerging environmental problem due to their potentially 
harmful nature. In this research, three different oxygen treatment systems were 
set up to study the effects of oxygen changes on the abundance of ARGs in the 
HZ. In addition, the effects of temperature and salinity on ARGs were 
investigated under aerobic and anaerobic systems, respectively. The bacterial 
community composition of sediment samples and the relationship with ARGs were 
analyzed. The explanation ratio and causality of the driving factors affecting 
ARGs were analyzed using variation partitioning analysis (VPA) and structural 
equation model (SEM). The relative abundance of ARGs and mobile genetic elements 
(MGEs) in the anaerobic system increased significantly, which was higher than 
that in the aerobic system and the aerobic-anaerobic interaction system. The 
experiment of salinity and temperature also further proved this result. There 
were many bacterial communities that affected tetracycline and sulfonamide ARGs 
in sediments, and these host bacteria are mainly concentrated in Proteobacteria, 
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. VPA and SEM further revealed that the abundance of 
ARGs was mainly influenced by changes in bacterial communities and oxygen 
conditions, and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of MGEs also had a positive 
effect on the spread of ARGs. Those findings suggest that complex oxygen 
conditions in the HZ alter bacterial communities and promote MGEs-mediated 
horizontal transfer, which together lead to the spread of ARGs. This study has 
value as a reference for formulating effective strategies to minimize the 
propagation of ARGs in underground environment."
633,"During its life cycle, Trypanosoma cruzi undergoes physiological modifications 
in order to adapt to insect vector and mammalian host conditions. 
Metacyclogenesis is essential, as the parasite acquires the ability to infect a 
variety of mammalian species, including humans, in which pathology is caused. In 
this work, the transcriptomes of metacyclic trypomastigotes and epimastigotes 
were analyzed in order to identify differentially expressed genes that may be 
involved in metacyclogenesis. Toward this end, in vitro induction of 
metacyclogenesis was performed and metacyclic trypomastigotes obtained. RNA-Seq 
was performed on triplicate samples of epimastigotes and metacyclic 
trypomastigotes. Differential gene expression analysis showed 513 genes, of 
which 221 were upregulated and 292 downregulated in metacyclic trypomastigotes. 
The analysis showed that these genes are related to biological processes 
relevant in metacyclogenesis. Within these processes, we found that most of the 
genes associated with infectivity and gene expression regulation were 
upregulated in metacyclic trypomastigotes, while genes involved in cell 
division, DNA replication, differentiation, cytoskeleton, and metabolism were 
mainly downregulated. The participation of some of these genes in T. cruzi 
metacyclogenesis is of interest, as they may be used as potential therapeutic 
targets in the design of new drugs for Chagas disease."
634,"Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) is the preferable treatment option of the 
infections caused by Achromobacter spp. Our study aimed to analyze the SXT 
resistance of 98 Achromobacter spp. isolates from pediatric patients, among 
which 33 isolates were SXT-resistant. The presence of intI1 was screened by PCR 
and genome sequence analyses. The intI1 gene was detected in 10 of SXT-resistant 
isolates that had shorter intI1 PCR fragments named intI1S. Structural changes 
in intI1S were confirmed by genome sequencing and analyses which revealed 86 
amino acids deletion in IntI1S protein compared to canonical IntI1 protein. All 
IntI1S isolates were of non-CF origin. Pan-genome analysis of intI1S bearing A. 
xylosoxidans isolates comprised 9052 genes, with the core genome consisting of 
5455 protein-coding genes. Results in this study indicate that IntI1S isolates 
were derived from clinical settings and that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients were 
potential reservoirs for healthcare-associated infections that occurred in 
non-CF patients."
635,"The phylum Pseudomonadota is amongst the most represented in the environment, 
with a comparatively lower prevalence in the human oral cavity. The ubiquity of 
Pseudomonadota and the fact that the oral cavity is the most likely entry portal 
of bacteria from external sources underlie the need to better understand its 
occurrence in the interface environment-humans. Yet, the relevance oral 
Pseudomonadota is largely underexplored in the scientific literature, a gap that 
this review aims at addressing by making, for the first time, an overview of the 
diversity and ecology of Pseudomonadota in the oral cavity. The screening of 
scientific literature and human microbiome databases unveiled 1328 reports of 
Pseudomonadota in the oral cavity. Most of these belonged to the classes Beta- 
and Gammaproteobacteria, mainly to the families Neisseriaceae, 
Campylobacteriaceae, and Pasteurelaceae. Others also regularly reported include 
genera such as Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Escherichia, 
Burkholderia, or Citrobacter, whose members have high potential to acquire 
virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. This review provides evidence that 
clinically relevant environmental Pseudomonadota may colonize humans via oral 
cavity. The need for further investigation about Pseudomonadota at the 
environment-oral cavity interface and their role as vectors potentially involved 
in virulence and antibiotic resistance transmission is demonstrated. KEY POINTS: 
• Neisseriaceae, Campylobacteriaceae, and Pasteurelaceae are part of the core 
oral microbiome • Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter, or Burkholderia are 
frequent in the oral microbiome • Gut dysbiosis may be associated with 
colonization by ubiquitous oral Pseudomonadota."
636,"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J1 (UBE2J1) has been proven to participate in 
the ubiquitination of multiple substrate proteins. However, the underlying 
mechanisms of UBE2J1 as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme participating in cancer 
development and progression remain largely unknown. Here, we identified that 
UBE2J1 is downregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and cell lines which 
are mediated by DNA hypermethylation of its promoter, and decreased UBE2J1 is 
associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, UBE2J1 serving as a suppressor 
gene inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells. Mechanistically, 
UBE2J1-TRIM25, forming an E2-E3 complex, physically interacts with and targets 
RPS3 for ubiquitination and degradation at the K214 residue. The downregulated 
RPS3 caused by UBE2J1 overexpression restrains NF-κB translocation into the 
nucleus and therefore inactivates the NF-κB signaling pathway. Our study 
revealed a novel role of UBE2J1-mediated RPS3 poly-ubiquitination and 
degradation in disrupting the NF-κB signaling pathway, which may serve as a 
novel and promising biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC."
637,"BACKGROUND: The neurotransmitter metabolism in spontaneously hypertensive rats 
(SHR) is disordered, and these disturbances in neurotransmitter levels can 
further exacerbate the development of hypertension. Neurotransmitters can affect 
the expression of circadian clock genes.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify the time-dependent internal mechanism of the imbalance of 
the target neurotransmitter metabolic rhythm of spontaneously hypertensive rats, 
the circadian research was carried out by the method of targeted metabolomics 
and molecular biology technology.
METHODS: We have explored the mechanism of isorhynchophylline regulating the 
circadian rhythm through the ERK signaling pathway and thus treating 
hypertension by detecting the changes of central hypothalamic biological clock 
rhythm genes after isorhynchophylline intervention, from hypothalamic 
neurotransmitter rhythmicity.
RESULTS: The expression of rhythm genes in normal rats showed a certain rhythm 
at 6 time points, while the expression of rhythm genes in model rats decreased, 
and the gene rhythm returned to normal after isorhynchophylline treatment. 
Cosine analysis of 12 neurotransmitters in hypothalamus showed that there were 6 
rhythmic neurotransmitters in the normal group, while in the model group, 4 of 
the 6 neurotransmitters lost their rhythmicity, and the rhythmicity returned to 
normal after isorhynchophylline intervention. Compared with the normal group, 
the expression of ERK protein in the model group increased significantly and 
decreased after isorhynchophylline treatment.
CONCLUSION: The mechanism of isorhynchophylline treating hypertension is not 
only the regulation of serum neurotransmitters rhythm, but also acting on rhythm 
genes in the feedback loop of the central biological clock."
638,"BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy 
where tumorigenesis and metastasis are believed to be tied to the hallmarks of 
hypoxia and tumor microenvironment (TME).
METHODS: In this study, to investigate the relationships among hypoxia, TME, and 
HCC prognosis, we collected two independent datasets from a public database 
(TCGA-LIHC for identification, GSE14520 for validation) and identified the 
hypoxia-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the TCGA data, and 
the univariable Cox regression and lasso regression analyses were performed to 
construct the prognosis model. An HCC prognosis model with 4 hypoxia-related 
DEGs (""NDRG1"", ""ENO1"", ""SERPINE1"", ""ANXA2"") was constructed, and high- and 
low-risk groups of HCC were established by the median of the model risk score.
RESULTS: The survival analysis revealed significant differences between the two 
groups in both datasets, with the results of the AUC of the ROC curve of 1, 3, 
and 5 years in two datasets indicating the robustness of the prognosis model. 
Meanwhile, for the TCGA-LIHC data, the immune characteristics between the two 
groups revealed that the low-risk group presented higher levels of activated NK 
cells, monocytes, and M2 macrophages, and 7 immune checkpoint genes were found 
upregulated in the high-risk group. Additionally, the two groups have no 
difference in molecular characteristics (tumor mutational burden, TMB). The 
proportion of recurrence was higher in the high-risk group, and the correlation 
between the recurrence month and risk score was negative, indicating high-risk 
correlates with a short recurrence month.
CONCLUSION: In summary, this study shows the association among hypoxic signals, 
TME, and HCC prognosis and may help reveal potential regulatory mechanisms 
between hypoxia, tumorigenesis, and metastasis in HCC. The hypoxia-related model 
demonstrated the potential to be a predictor and drug target of prognosis."
639,"Cognitive impairment in Down syndrome (DS) results from the abnormal expression 
of hundreds of genes. However, the impact of KCNJ6, a gene located in the middle 
of the 'Down syndrome critical region' of chromosome 21, seems to stand out. 
KCNJ6 encodes GIRK2 (KIR3.2) subunits of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying 
potassium channels, which serve as effectors for GABAB, m2, 5HT1A, A1, and many 
other postsynaptic metabotropic receptors. GIRK2 subunits are heavily expressed 
in neocortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus. By controlling resting membrane 
potential and neuronal excitability, GIRK2 channels may thus affect both 
synaptic plasticity and stability of neural circuits in the brain regions 
important for learning and memory. Here, we discuss recent experimental data 
regarding the role of KCNJ6/GIRK2 in neuronal abnormalities and cognitive 
impairment in models of DS and Aalzheimer's disease (AD). The results 
compellingly show that signaling through GIRK2 channels is abnormally enhanced 
in mouse genetic models of Down syndrome and that partial suppression of GIRK2 
channels with pharmacological or genetic means can restore synaptic plasticity 
and improve impaired cognitive functions. On the other hand, signaling through 
GIRK2 channels is downregulated in AD models, such as models of early 
amyloidopathy. In these models, reduced GIRK2 channel signaling promotes 
neuronal hyperactivity, causing excitatory-inhibitory imbalance and neuronal 
death. Accordingly, activation of GABAB/GIRK2 signaling by GIRK channel 
activators or GABAB receptor agonists may reduce Aβ-induced hyperactivity and 
subsequent neuronal death, thereby exerting a neuroprotective effect in models 
of AD."
640,"Conotruncal heart defects (CTDs) are severe complex congenital heart diseases 
(CHDs) with malformations of the outflow tract. Both genetic and environmental 
factors contribute to the development of CTDs, with genetic contribution playing 
a leading role. NOTCH1 variation is one of the main genetic pathogenic factors. 
We aimed to determine the genetic basis of two fetuses presenting CTD in a 
Chinese family.&#xD; METHODS: A case report and a literature review of CTD 
phenotypes caused by NOTCH1 gene variation. &#xD; RESULTS: We describe two 
fetuses with CTD in a Chinese family whose parents were both healthy. The whole 
exome sequencing detected a novel heterozygous missense variation, 
c.1724G&gt;C:p.Cys575Ser, in the NOTCH1 gene in the two affected fetuses but not 
in the parents. This variation was predicted to be pathogenic. &#xD; 
CONCLUSIONS: The cases described here expand the gene variation spectrum of 
CTDs, and emphasize the importance of NOTCH1 screening in CTD patients. This

641,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing technology (scRNA-seq) brings research to single-cell 
resolution. However, a major drawback of scRNA-seq is large sparsity, i.e. 
expressed genes with no reads due to technical noise or limited sequence depth 
during the scRNA-seq protocol. This phenomenon is also called 'dropout' events, 
which likely affect downstream analyses such as differential expression 
analysis, the clustering and visualization of cell subpopulations, cellular 
trajectory inference, etc. Therefore, there is a need to develop a method to 
identify and impute these dropout events. We propose Bubble, which first 
identifies dropout events from all zeros based on expression rate and 
coefficient of variation of genes within cell subpopulation, and then leverages 
an autoencoder constrained by bulk RNA-seq data to only impute those values. 
Unlike other deep learning-based imputation methods, Bubble fuses the matched 
bulk RNA-seq data as a constraint to reduce the introduction of false positive 
signals. Using simulated and several real scRNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate 
that Bubble enhances the recovery of missing values, gene-to-gene and 
cell-to-cell correlations, and reduces the introduction of false positive 
signals. Regarding some crucial downstream analyses of scRNA-seq data, Bubble 
facilitates the identification of differentially expressed genes, improves the 
performance of clustering and visualization, and aids the construction of 
cellular trajectory. More importantly, Bubble provides fast and scalable 
imputation with minimal memory usage."
642,"Underlying medical conditions, such as cancer, kidney disease and heart failure, 
are associated with a higher risk for severe COVID-19. Accurate classification 
of COVID-19 patients with underlying medical conditions is critical for 
personalized treatment decision and prognosis estimation. In this study, we 
propose an interpretable artificial intelligence model termed VDJMiner to mine 
the underlying medical conditions and predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients 
according to their immune repertoires. In a cohort of more than 1400 COVID-19 
patients, VDJMiner accurately identifies multiple underlying medical conditions, 
including cancers, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disease, diabetes, 
congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, asthma and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, with an average area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.961. Meanwhile, in this same cohort, VDJMiner 
achieves an AUC of 0.922 in predicting severe COVID-19. Moreover, VDJMiner 
achieves an accuracy of 0.857 in predicting the response of COVID-19 patients to 
tocilizumab treatment on the leave-one-out test. Additionally, VDJMiner 
interpretively mines and scores V(D)J gene segments of the T-cell receptors that 
are associated with the disease. The identified associations between single-cell 
V(D)J gene segments and COVID-19 are highly consistent with previous studies.

643,"Mammary pathogenic Escherichia coli (MPEC) is one of the most common pathogens 
associated with clinical mastitis. We analyzed isolates obtained from milk 
samples of cows with clinical mastitis, collected from 10 farms in Brazil, to 
verify molecular and phenotypic characteristics. A total of 192 (4.5%) mammary 
pathogenic E. coli isolates were obtained from 4,275 milk samples analyzed, but 
we tested 161. We assigned most of these isolates to E. coli phylogroups B1 
(52.8%) and A (36.6%), although phylogroups B2, C, D, E, and unknown also 
occurred. All isolates were assessed for the presence of several genes encoding 
virulence factors, such as adhesins (sfaDE, papC, afaBC III, ecpA, fimH, papA, 
and iha), toxins (hlyA, cnf1, sat, vat, and cdt), siderophores (iroN, irp2, 
iucD, ireA, and sitA), an invasion protein (ibeA), and serum resistance proteins 
(traT, KpsMTII, and ompT), and isolates from phylogroups B1, B2, and E showed up 
to 8 genes. Two isolates harbored the locus of enterocyte effacement (escN+) and 
lack the bundle-forming pilus (bfpB-) operon, which corresponds to a molecular 
profile of a subgroup of diarrheagenic E. coli (aEPEC), thus being classified as 
hybrid MPEC/aEPEC isolates. These isolates displayed a localized adherence-like 
pattern of adherence in HeLa cells and were able to promote F-actin 
polymerization underneath adherent bacteria. Based on the pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis analyses, considerable genetic variability was observed. A low 
index of antimicrobial resistance was observed and 2 extended-spectrum 
β-lactamase-producing E. coli were identified, both harboring blaCTX-M15 gene, 
and were classified as ST10 and ST993 using multilocus sequence typing. A total 
of 148 (91.2%) isolates were weak biofilm producers or formed no biofilm. 
Because raw milk is still frequently consumed in Brazil, the occurrence of 
virulence factor-encoding genes from extraintestinal or diarrheagenic E. coli 
added to the presence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing isolates can 
turn this veterinary medicine problem into a public health concern."
644,"In mice and humans, Nik-related protein kinase (Nrk) is an X-linked gene that 
encodes a serine/threonine kinase belonging to GCK group 4. Nrk knockout (Nrk 
KO) mice exhibit delayed delivery, possibly due to defective communication 
between the Nrk KO conceptus and its mother. However, the mechanism of delayed 
labor remains largely unknown. Here, we found that in pregnant mothers with the 
Nrk KO conceptus, the serum progesterone (P4) and placental lactogen (PL-2) 
concentrations in late pregnancy were higher than those in the wild type. 
Moreover, we demonstrated that Nrk is expressed in trophoblast giant cells 
(TGCs) and syncytiotrophoblast-2 (SynT-2) in the labyrinth layer of the mouse 
placenta. In the human placenta, NRK is also expressed in Syn-T of villi. Both 
human Syn-T and mouse TGCs of the labyrinth layer are present within fetal 
tissues that are in direct contact with the maternal blood. The labyrinth layer 
of the Nrk KO conceptus was gigantic, with enlarged cytoplasm and Golgi bodies 
in the TGCs. To investigate the function of Nrk in the labyrinth layer, a 
differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was performed. The DEG analysis 
revealed that labor-promoting factors, such as prostaglandins, were decreased, 
and pregnancy-maintaining factors, such as the prolactin family and P4 receptor, 
were increased. These findings suggest that the Nrk KO mice exhibit delayed 
delivery owing to high P4 concentrations caused by the hypersecretion of 
pregnancy-maintaining factors, such as PL-2, from the placenta."
645,"In the fermentative production of compounds by using microorganisms, control of 
the transporter activity responsible for substrate uptake and product efflux, in 
addition to intracellular metabolic modification, is important from a 
productivity perspective. However, there has been little progress in analyses of 
the functions of microbial membrane transporters, and because of the difficulty 
in finding transporters that transport target compounds, only a few transporters 
have been put to practical use. Here, we constructed a Corynebacterium 
glutamicum-derived transporter expression library (CgTP-Express library) with 
the fusion partner gene mstX and used a peptide-feeding method with the 
dipeptide L-Ala-L-Ala to search for alanine exporters in the library. Among 39 
genes in the library, five candidate alanine exporters (NCgl2533, NCgl2683, 
NCgl0986, NCgl0453, and NCgl0929) were found; expression of NCgl2533 increased 
the alanine concentration in cell culture. The CgTP-Express library was thus 
effective for finding a new transporter candidate."
646,"Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) are produced mainly by gram-negative 
bacteria in Enterobacteriaceae. One of the major types of ESBLs is sulfhydryl 
variable (SHV) -type ESBL. Herein, we attempted to develop a simple and rapid 
method for the detection of the ESBL blaSHV gene by loop-mediated isothermal 
amplification (LAMP) . The five-primer set designed could amplify blaSHV gene at 
an isothermal temperature of 65℃. The detection limit of the LAMP method with 
the LF loop primer was 1 copy/tube, which was 10,000-fold more sensitive than 
that of the conventional PCR. The LAMP assay could also detect the direct 
amplification of blaSHV gene from a single river water sample in Tokyo. The LAMP 
method has great potential for applications in hospital, soil and water 
environment, food, and livestock."
647,"Genome-scale metabolic models comprehensively describe an organism's metabolism 
and can be tailored using omics data to model condition-specific physiology. The 
quality of context-specific models is impacted by (i) choice of algorithm and 
parameters and (ii) alternate context-specific models that equally explain the 
-omics data. Here we quantify the influence of alternate optima on microbial and 
mammalian model extraction using GIMME, iMAT, MBA, and mCADRE. We find that 
metabolic tasks defining an organism's phenotype must be explicitly and 
quantitatively protected. The scope of alternate models is strongly influenced 
by algorithm choice and the topological properties of the parent genome-scale 
model with fatty acid metabolism and intracellular metabolite transport 
contributing much to alternate solutions in all models. mCADRE extracted the 
most reproducible context-specific models and models generated using MBA had the 
most alternate solutions. There were fewer qualitatively different solutions 
generated by GIMME in E. coli, but these increased substantially in the 
mammalian models. Screening ensembles using a receiver operating characteristic 
plot identified the best-performing models. A comprehensive evaluation of models 
extracted using combinations of extraction methods and expression thresholds 
revealed that GIMME generated the best-performing models in E. coli, whereas 
mCADRE is better suited for complex mammalian models. These findings suggest 
guidelines for benchmarking -omics integration algorithms and motivate the 
development of a systematic workflow to enumerate alternate models and extract 
biologically relevant context-specific models."
648,"The growth and development in Tribolium castaneum were poorly understood at the 
transcriptome level. Currently, we identified 15,756, 9941 and 10,080 
differentially expressed transcripts between late eggs VS early larvae, late 
larvae VS early pupae, and late pupae VS early adults of T. castaneum by 
RNA-seq, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis on nine genes expression. 
Functional enrichment analysis indicated that DNA replication, cell cycle and 
insect hormone biosynthesis significantly enriched differentially expressed 
genes. The transcription of DNA replication and cell cycle genes decreased after 
hatching but increased after pupation. The juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroid 
biosynthesis genes decreased after hatching, and the JH degradation genes were 
stimulated after pupation and eclosion while the ecdysteroid degradation gene 
CYP18A1 decreased after pupation. Silencing CYP18A1 elevated the titer of 
ecdysteroids and caused developmental arrest at the late larval stage. This 
study promotes the understanding of insect growth and development."
649,"Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis (PPV) is a diagnosis which denotes the 
coexistence of pigmentary and vascular birthmarks of specific types, accompanied 
by variable multisystem involvement including central nervous system disease, 
asymmetrical growth and a predisposition to malignancy. Using a tightly 
phenotyped group and high depth next generation sequencing of affected tissues 
we discover here clonal mosaic variants in gene PTPN11 encoding SHP2 phosphatase 
as a cause of PPV type III or spilorosea. Within an individual the same variant 
is found in distinct pigmentary and vascular birthmarks and is undetectable in 
blood. We go on to demonstrate that the same variants can cause either the 
specific pigmentary or vascular phenotypes alone, as well as driving melanoma 
development within the pigmentary lesion. Protein conformational modelling 
highlights that while variants lead to loss of function at the level of the 
phosphatase domain, resultant conformational changes promote longer ligand 
binding. In vitro modelling of the missense variants confirms downstream MAPK 
pathway overactivation, and widespread disruption of human endothelial cell 
angiogenesis. Importantly, PTPN11-mosaic patients theoretically risk passing on 
the variant to their children as the germline RASopathy Noonan syndrome with 
lentigines. These findings improve our understanding of the pathogenesis and 
biology of naevus spilus and capillary malformation syndromes, paving the way 
for better clinical management."
650,"Rice paddy is a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4), a major global 
warming source. CH4 emission from paddy fields is greatly influenced by 
phosphorus (P) management, especially the long-term non-P application on CH4 
emission is largely unexplored. In the present study, long-term non-P 
application (NK) and P application (NPK) treatments of two paddy fields in 
Suzhou (from 1980) and Yixing (from 2009), Tai Lake region was done. The effect 
of P application on CH4 emissions and related microorganisms (i.e., methanogens 
and methanotrophs) from 2019 to 2020 was analyzed. Results revealed that 
long-term NK treatment didn't alter the seasonal trend of CH4 flux, but 
significantly promoted CH4 emissions at the tillering stage. The non-P 
application for >12 years caused the cumulative CH4 emissions of NK treatment in 
the whole rice season significantly increased by 41.9-221 % in two fields 
compared to NPK treatment in 2019 and 2020. NK treatment increased the abundance 
and diversity of methanogens, while reducing the abundance and diversity of 
methanotrophs. Community composition of soil pmoA gene differed in two 
experiment sites. Correlation analysis revealed that the CH4 emission was 
significant and positively related to soil mcrA gene and C/P while negatively 
related to soil pmoA gene and P. Structure equation model analysis show the low 
soil available P content was the dominant driving factor for the high CH4 
emission under long-term non-P application through its direct impact on soil 
mcrA and pmoA genes. The increased soil organic acid content was another driver 
which was positively related to soil mcrA gene and negatively to soil pmoA gene. 
Our findings demonstrate the important role of soil P in regulating CH4 
emissions from paddy fields in the Tai Lake region, China, and suitable P 
application is necessary for ensuring the yield while reducing CH4 emission."
651,"Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP5) plays an important biological 
function in immune defense and is highly expressed in activated macrophages, 
osteoclasts and dendritic cells. In teleost, the functionality of ACP5 remains 
to be revealed. In this study, we cloned and identified SoACP5 from red drum 
(Sciaenops ocellatus) and analyzed its function in vivo and in vitro. The open 
reading frame of SoACP5 is 1002 bp in length, encoding 333 amino acids. SoACP5 
shares high sequence identities (96.70%-49.25%) with ACP5 of other species. The 
SoACP5 mRNA was widely distributed in collected tissues of healthy red drum, and 
with the maximum in gills. The expression of SoACP5 increased significantly in 
vivo following challenge with Edwardsiella tarda. Moreover, the recombinant 
SoACP5 protein (rSoACP5) was purified with his-tag band resin columns, and 
confirmed to have phosphatase activity which was optimal at pH 5 and 55 °C. 
Various metal ions (K+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+ and Fe3+) have 
different effects on phosphatase activity. rSoACP5 induced the cellular 
proliferation of peripheral blood leukocytes. The over-expression and knockdown 
of SoACP5 in vivo had a significant effect on bacterial proliferation. 
Furthermore, both of the antibacterial activity and phosphatase activity were 
decreased when the reducedSoACP5 was oxidized by H2O2. In summary, the present 
study indicated that SoACP5 is likely involved in host defense against bacterial 
infection in S. ocellatus."
652,"BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus is an emerging infectious disease in Asia, caused by 
Orientia tsutsugamushi (Ot). From Nepal, only scant data on the genetic 
epidemiology of this agent is available, and determinants of immunoregulation 
are poorly understood.
METHODS: Patients (n=238) referred to the National Public Health Laboratory 
(Kathmandu, Nepal) from all over Nepal for suspected scrub typhus were enrolled 
upon positive IgM testing between July and October 2015. From Ot 16S and 47 kD 
PCR-positive samples, the variable domain I of the 56 kD gene was sequenced and 
phylogenetically analysed. T helper cell-associated cytokines (n=13) and 
chemokines (n=12) were quantified by multiplex bead arrays.
RESULTS: In 93/238 (39.1%) IgM-positive samples, Ot DNA was detected by qPCR. 
Phylogenetic analysis of 56 kD sequences revealed 7 distinct clusters, 6 of them 
with high homologies to strains detected in other countries. The Th1-related 
cytokines IFN-γ and CXCL10 were strongly upregulated and correlated with 
bacteremia, while levels of Th2-associated chemokines were reduced. Bacteremia 
also correlated with concentrations of IL-6 and IL-10, but not TNF-α.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a considerable genetic heterogeneity of 
human-pathogenic Ot strains circulating in Nepal. Acute Nepalese scrub typhus 
patients showed strong Th1 but impaired Th2 responses, especially on the 
chemokine level."
653,"Wallachian and Sumava sheep are autochthonous breeds that have undergone a 
significant bottleneck effect and subsequent restoration efforts. The first 
objective of this study was to evaluate the degree of genetic variability of 
both breeds and, therefore, the current management of the breeding. The second 
was to determine whether these two breeds still retain their genetic uniqueness 
in relation to each other and other breeds, despite regenerative interventions. 
Our data consisted of 48 individuals of Sumava and 37 individuals of Wallachian 
sheep. The comparison data contained 25 other breeds (primarily European) from 
the HapMap dataset generated by the International Sheep Genomics Consortium. 
When comparing all 27 breeds, the Czech breeds clustered with 15 other breeds 
and formed a single branch with them according to Nei's distances. At the same 
time, however, the clusters of both breeds were integral and easily 
distinguishable from the others when displayed with principal component analysis 
(PCA). Population substructure analysis did not show any common genetic ancestry 
of the Czech national breeds and breeds used for regeneration or, eventually, 
breeds whose ancestral population was used for regeneration. The average values 
of FST were higher in Wallachian sheep (FST = 0.14) than in Sumava sheep 
(FST = 0.08). The linkage disequilibrium (LD) extension per autosome was higher 
in Wallachian than in Sumava sheep. Consequently, the Ne estimates five 
generations ago were 68 for Sumava versus 34 for Wallachian sheep. Both native 
Czech breeds exhibit a wide range of inbreeding based on the excess of 
homozygosity (FHOM) among individuals, from -0.04 to 0.16 in Sumava and from 
-0.13 to 0.12 in Wallachian. Average inbreeding based on runs of homozygosity 
was 0.21 in Sumava and 0.27 in Wallachian. Most detected runs of homozygosity 
(ROH) were less than 5 Mb long for both breeds. ROH segments longer than 15 Mb 
were absent in Wallachian sheep. Concerning putative selection signatures, a 
total of 471 candidate genes in Wallachian sheep within 11 hotspots and 653 
genes within 13 hotspots in Sumava sheep were identified. Czech breeds appear to 
be well differentiated from each other and other European breeds. Their genetic 
diversity is low, especially in the case of the Wallachian breed. Sumava is not 
so threatened by low diversity but has a larger share of the non-native gene 
pool."
654,"Fibrosis, defined as an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix, is the 
end point of a defective regenerative process, unresolved inflammation and/or 
chronic damage. Numerous muscle disorders (MD) are characterized by high levels 
of fibrosis associated with muscle wasting and weakness. Fibrosis alters muscle 
homeostasis/regeneration and fiber environment and may interfere with gene and 
cell therapies. Slowing down or reversing fibrosis is a crucial therapeutic goal 
to maintain muscle identity in the context of therapies. Several pathways are 
implicated in the modulation of the fibrotic progression and multiple 
therapeutic compounds targeting fibrogenic signals have been tested in MDs, 
mostly in the context of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. In this review, we present 
an up-to-date overview of pharmacotherapies that have been tested to reduce 
fibrosis in the skeletal muscle."
655,"In order to form follicles and ovulate normally, there must be abundant blood 
vessels. Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (AS), as a traditional Chinese 
medicinal herb, has the effects of tonifying the blood and activating the blood 
circulation. However, the effect of AS on angiogenesis in hen-follicles remains 
to be discovered. In this study, we identified vascular richness, granulosa 
layer thickness, expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 
(CD31) and the content of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in 
granulosa layers to elucidate the effect of AS extract on angiogenesis in 
preovulatory follicles (F1-F3) of late-phase laying hens (75 wk). Based on 
network pharmacology, we predicted beta-sitosterol, ferulic acid, and caffeic 
acid as the main active components of AS, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α 
(HIF1α), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) as hub targets 
of AS in angiogenesis. The intersection targets were enriched by Gene Ontology 
(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and the hub 
targets were verified by immunofluorescence and western blot. Molecular docking 
of active components with hub targets was performed and verified in vitro. The 
results showed that AS extract promoted angiogenesis in preovulatory follicles 
and increased granulosa cell layer thickness, CD31 expression and content of 
VEGFA. Experiments in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that AS extract promoted 
the expression of HIF1α and VEGFA, up-regulated the phosphorylation levels of 
VEGFR2. These results further demonstrated the reliability of molecular docking 
and network pharmacology findings. In summary, AS extract can promote 
angiogenesis in the preovulatory follicles in late-phase laying hens."
656,"Past antimicrobial misuse has led to the spread of antimicrobial resistance 
amongst pathogens, reportedly a major public health threat. Attempts to reduce 
the spread of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria are in place worldwide, 
among which finding alternatives to antimicrobials have a pivotal role. Such 
molecules could be used as ""green alternatives"" to reduce the bacterial load 
either by targeting specific bacterial groups or more generically, functioning 
as biocides when delivered in vivo. In this study, the effect of in-water 
peracetic acid as a broad-spectrum antibiotic alternative for broilers was 
assessed via hydrolysis of precursors sodium percarbonate and 
tetraacetylethylenediamine. Six equidistant peracetic acid levels were tested 
from 0 to 50 ppm using four pens per treatment and 4 birds per pen (i.e., 16 
birds per treatment and 96 in total). Peracetic acid was administered daily from 
d 7 to 14 of age whilst measuring performance parameters and end-point bacterial 
concentration (qPCR) in crop, jejunum, and ceca, as well as crop 16S sequencing. 
PAA treatment, especially at 20, 30, and 40 ppm, increased body weight at d 14, 
and feed intake during PAA exposure compared to control (P < 0.05). PAA 
decreased bacterial concentration in the crop only (P < 0.05), which was 
correlated to better performance (P < 0.05). Although no differences in alpha- 
and beta-diversity were found, it was observed a reduction of Lactobacillus (P < 
0.05) and Flectobacillus (P < 0.05) in most treatments compared to control, 
together with an increased abundance of predicted 4-aminobutanoate degradation 
(V) pathway. The analysis of the AMR genes did not point towards any systematic 
differences in gene abundance due to treatment administration. This, together 
with the rest of our observations could indicate that proximal gut microbiota 
modulation could result in performance amelioration. Thus, peracetic acid may be 
a valid antimicrobial alternative that could also positively affect performance."
657,"A taxonomic study was conducted on 16 bacterial strains isolated from wild 
Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) from Seymour (Marambio) Island and James 
Ross Island. An initial screening by repetitive sequence-based PCR 
fingerprinting divided the strains studied into four coherent groups. 
Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences assigned all groups to 
the genus Corynebacterium and showed that Corynebacterium glyciniphilum and 
Corynebacterium terpenotabidum were the closest species with 16S rRNA gene 
sequence similarities between 95.4 % and 96.5 %. Further examination of the 
strains studied with ribotyping, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, comprehensive 
biotyping and calculation of average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA 
hybridisation values confirmed the separation of the four groups from each other 
and from the other Corynebacterium species. Chemotaxonomically, the four strains 
P5828T, P5850T, P6136T, P7210T representing the studied groups were 
characterised by C16:0 and C18:1ω9c as the major fatty acids, by the presence of 
meso-diaminopimelic acid in the peptidoglycan, the presence of corynemycolic 
acids and a quinone system with the predominant menaquinone MK-9(H2). The 
results of this study show that the strains studied represent four new species 
of the genus Corynebacterium, for which the names Corynebacterium antarcticum 
sp. nov. (type strain P5850T = CCM 8835T = LMG 30620T), Corynebacterium 
marambiense sp. nov. (type strain P5828T = CCM 8864T = LMG 31626T), 
Corynebacterium meridianum sp. nov. (type strain P6136T = CCM 8863T = LMG 
31628T) and Corynebacterium pygosceleis sp. nov. (type strain P7210T = CCM 
8836T = LMG 30621T) are proposed."
658,"BACKGROUND: Impaired glycolipid metabolism can induce vascular injury and plaque 
formation. It is important to investigate the associations between carotid 
plaque progression and lipid-lowering goal achievement and cardiovascular 
disease.
METHODS: Diabetic patients who underwent at least 2 carotid ultrasound scans 
with intervals ≥0.5 years and were hospitalized in the Department of 
Endocrinology at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital were included. Patients were 
divided into 3 groups based on carotid plaque progression: the persistent plaque 
absence, new-onset plaque and persistent plaque presence groups. The primary 
outcomes were CHD and stroke, while the secondary outcomes were low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(non-HDL-C) goal achievement.
RESULTS: There were 304 diabetic patients included, with a median follow-up 
period of 2.15 years. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, persistent 
plaque presence was positively associated with a 2.285-fold increase in coronary 
heart disease (CHD) prevalence, while new-onset plaque was associated with a 
3.225-fold increase in stroke prevalence compared to persistent plaque absence 
in patients with follow-up periods ≥ 0.5 years. The association remained 
significant in patients with a follow-up period ≥ 1 year and ≥2 years. The 
velocity of average plaque length change was independently associated with 
increased ΔLDL-C (last - goal) (β = 0.073, P = 0.048).
CONCLUSION: Carotid plaque progression had long-term association with CHD and 
stroke starting from 0.5 years, while the velocity of average plaque length 
associated with increased ΔLDL-C (last - goal) might reflect patient response to 
statins. Repeated carotid plaque measurements might guide lipid-lowering 
therapies."
659,"Sulfate is essential for healthy foetal growth and neurodevelopment. The SLC13A1 
sulfate transporter is primarily expressed in the kidney where it mediates 
sulfate reabsorption and maintains circulating sulfate levels. To meet foetal 
demands, maternal sulfate levels increase by twofold in pregnancy via 
upregulated SLC13A1 expression. Previous studies found hyposulfataemia and 
reduced renal Slc13a1 mRNA expression in rodent models with either severe 
vitamin D deficiency or perturbed vitamin D signalling. Here we investigated a 
mouse model of moderate vitamin D deficiency. However, serum sulfate level and 
renal Slc13a1 mRNA expression was not decreased by a moderate reduction in 
circulating vitamin D level. We confirmed that the mouse Slc13a1 5'-flanking 
region was upregulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 using luciferase assays in a cultured 
renal OK cell line. These results support the presence of a functional VDRE in 
the mouse Slc13a1 but suggests that moderate vitamin D deficiency does not 
impact on sulfate homeostasis. As sulfate biology is highly conserved between 
rodents and humans, we proposed that human SLC13A1 would be under similar 
transcriptional regulation by 1,25(OH)2D3. Using an online prediction tool we 
identified a putative VDRE in the SLC13A1 5'-flanking region but unlike the 
mouse Slc13a1 sequence, the human sequence did not confer a significant response 
to 1,25(OH)2D3 in vitro. Overall, this study suggests that moderate vitamin D 
deficiency may not alter sulfate homeostasis. This needs to be confirmed in 
humans, particularly during pregnancy when vitamin D and sulfate levels need to 
be maintained at high levels for healthy maternal and child outcomes."
660,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that estrogen and acute fasting for 9 
hours have antidepressant-like effects, by reducing immobility time in the 
forced swimming test. Estrogen and acute fasting share a common regulatory gene, 
Rasd2. RASD2 regulates dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) transmission, but the role of 
Rasd2 in the DRD2-mediated antidepressant-like effect of acute fasting has not 
been examined.
METHODS: In this study, open field test, forced swimming test, tail suspension 
test and sucrose preference test were used for behavioral assessments. RNA-seq, 
western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and co-immunoprecipitation were 
used to explore the role of Rasd2 in a depression model induced by ovariectomy, 
and the antidepressant-like effects of 9-hour fasting.
RESULTS: The RNA seq results show that acute fasting induced a significant 
change in Rasd2 gene expression. Depression-like behaviors induced by 
ovariectomy was associated with decrease in RASD2 and DRD2 protein levels in the 
hippocampus, and Rasd2 overexpression in the hippocampus alleviated 
depression-like behaviors and increased DRD2 expression. 9-hour fasting has 
antidepressant-like effects in ovariectomized mice, by up-regulating the protein 
levels of RASD2, DRD2, CREB-BDNF, Akt, and estrogen receptor beta, and above 
effects can be blocked by DRD2 antagonists.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Rasd2 and DRD2 play pivotal roles in 
depression-like behavior induced by ovariectomy. Rasd2 regulates DRD2-mediated 
antidepressant-like effects of acute fasting in ovariectomized mice. Rasd2 can 
therefore be postulated to be a potential therapeutic target for depression, and 
perhaps also a potential predictive marker for depression."
661,"An RNA aptamer that induces suitable conformational changes upon binding to a 
user-defined ligand allows us to artificially construct a riboswitch, a 
ligand-dependent and cis-acting gene regulatory RNA. Although such an aptamer 
can be obtained through in vitro selection, it is still challenging to 
rationally expand the variety of orthogonal ligand/aptamer (ligand/riboswitch) 
pairs. To achieve this in a facile, selection-free way, we herein focused on a 
specific type of ligand, 6-nt nanosized DNA (nDNA) and its aptamer that was 
previously selected to construct a eukaryotic artificial riboswitch. 
Specifically, we merely mutated one or more possible Watson-Crick base pairs in 
the nDNA/aptamer (nDNA/riboswitch) interactions into another base pair or pairs. 
Using two sets that each had 16 comprehensive mutations, we obtained three 
groups of several orthogonal nDNA/riboswitch pairs. These pairs could be used to 
create complex gene circuits, including multiple simultaneous and/or multistep 
cascading regulations in synthetic biology."
662,"BACKGROUND: We tested the utility of mini-pool PCR testing for the rational use 
of PCR consumables in screening for CoViD-19.
METHODS: After pilot experiments, 3-samples pool size was selected. One step 
RT-PCR was performed. The samples in the mini-pool having COVID gene 
amplification were tested individually.
RESULTS: 1548 samples tested in 516 mini-pools resulted 396 mini-pools as 
negative and 120 as positive. Upon individual testing, 110 samples tested 
positive and 9 were inconclusive. 876 PCR reactions were performed to test 1548 
samples, saving 43% PCR reagents. Centres with low prevalence resulted in most 
saving on reagents (50%), while centres with high prevalence resulted in more 
test reactions. Testing of individual samples resulted in delays in reporting.
CONCLUSIONS: Pooling can increase lab capacity, however, pooling delays results 
and cause degradation of samples."
663,"Here, we report the genome sequence of a popular Japanese chili pepper landrace, 
Capsicum annuum 'Takanotsume'. We used long-read sequencing and optical mapping, 
together with the genetic mapping technique, to obtain the chromosome-scale 
genome assembly of 'Takanotsume'. The assembly consists of 12 pseudomolecules, 
which corresponds to the basic chromosome number of C. annuum, and is 3,058.5 Mb 
in size, spanning 97.0% of the estimated genome size. A total of 34,324 
high-confidence genes were predicted in the genome, and 83.4% of the genome 
assembly was occupied by repetitive sequences. Comparative genomics of 
linked-read sequencing-derived de novo genome assemblies of two Capsicum 
chinense lines and whole-genome resequencing analysis of Capsicum species 
revealed not only nucleotide sequence variations but also genome structure 
variations (i.e., chromosomal rearrangements and transposon-insertion 
polymorphisms) between 'Takanotsume' and its relatives. Overall, the genome 
sequence data generated in this study will accelerate the pan-genomics and 
breeding of Capsicum, and facilitate the dissection of genetic mechanisms 
underlying the agronomically important traits of 'Takanotsume'."
664,"Uridine diphosphate-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) mediate the 
glycosylation of plant metabolites, thereby altering their physicochemical 
properties and bioactivities. Plants possess numerous UGT genes, with the 
encoded enzymes often glycosylating multiple substrates and some exhibiting 
substrate inhibition kinetics, but the biological function and molecular basis 
of these phenomena are not fully understood. Since the promiscuous 
monolignol/phytoalexin NbUGT72AY1 exhibits substrate inhibition (Ki) at 4 μM 
scopoletin, while the highly homologous monolignol StUGT72AY2 is inhibited at 
190 μM we used hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass-spectrometry and structure-based 
mutational analyses of both proteins and introduced NbUGT72AY1 residues into 
StUGT72AY2 and vice versa to study promiscuity and substrate inhibition of UGTs. 
A single F87I and chimeric mutant of NbUGT72AY1 showed significantly reduced 
scopoletin substrate inhibition while the monolignol glycosylation activity was 
almost unaffected. Reverse mutations in StUGT72AY2 resulted in increased 
scopoletin glycosylation, leading to enhanced promiscuity, which was accompanied 
by substrate inhibition. Studies of 3D structures identified open and closed 
UGT-conformers, allowing visualization of the dynamics of conformational changes 
occurring during catalysis. Previously postulated substrate access tunnels 
likely serve as drainage channels. The results suggest a two-site model in which 
the second substrate molecule binds near the catalytic site and blocks product 
release. The mutational studies show that minor changes in amino acid sequence 
can enhance the promiscuity of the enzyme and add new capabilities such as 
substrate inhibition without affecting existing functions. The proposed 
subfunctionalization mechanism of expanded promiscuity may play a role in enzyme 
evolution and highlights the importance of promiscuous enzymes in providing new 
functions."
665,"Photosystem II (PSII) is a multisubunit protein complex of the photosynthetic 
electron transport chain that is vital to photosynthesis. Although the 
structure, composition, and function of PSII are well understood, its mechanism 
of biogenesis remains largely elusive. THYLAKOID RHODANESE-LIKE (TROL) provides 
an anchor for leaf-type ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase (LFNR). Here, we 
identified a second type THYLAKOID RHODANESE-LIKE (TROL) protein, TROL2, encoded 
by seed plant genomes whose function has not previously been reported. We show 
that TROL2 is a photosystem II (PSII) assembly cofactor with essential roles in 
the establishment of photoautotrophy. TROL2 contains a 45-amino-acid domain, 
which we termed the CLS (chlorotic lethal seedling) domain, that is both 
necessary and sufficient for TROL2 function in PSII assembly and 
photoautotrophic growth. Based on a phylogenetic analyses, we hypothesize that 
TROL2 arose from ancestral TROL1 via gene duplication before the emergence of 
seed plants and acquired the CLS domain via evolution of the sequence encoding 
its N-terminal portion. We further revealed that TROL2 (or CLS) forms an 
assembly cofactor complex with the intrinsic thylakoid membrane protein LOW PSII 
ACCUMULATION2 (LPA2) and interacts with small PSII subunits to facilitate PSII 
complex assembly. In conclusion, we report that TROL2 (CLS) is essential for 
photoautotrophy in angiosperms and reveal its mechanistic role in PSII complex 
assembly, shedding light on both the molecular mechanism of photosynthetic 
complex assembly and the evolution of angiosperms."
666,"OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study aimed to investigate the value of whole 
exome sequencing (WES) for clubfoot (CF) fetuses with or without other 
structural abnormalities and to further explore the genetic causes of fetal CF.
METHODS: this study included 83 singleton pregnancies diagnosed with fetal CF 
referred to our center between January 2016 and March 2022; cases were divided 
into two groups: isolated CF and non-isolated CF. After excluding cases with 
positive karyotyping and chromosomal microarray analysis results, WES was 
performed for the eligible fetuses and parents. Monogenic variants detected by 
WES and perinatal outcomes were recorded and evaluated at postnatal follow-up.
RESULTS: overall, clinically significant variations were identified in 12.0% 
(10/83) of fetuses, and the detection rate was significantly higher in the 
non-isolated than in the isolated CF group (8/36, 22.2% vs. 2/47, 4.3%, 
p = 0.031). We additionally detected eight (9.6%) fetuses harboring variants of 
unknown significance. We identified 11 clinically significant variations 
correlating with clinical phenotypes in nine genes from ten fetuses, with KLHL40 
being the most frequent (n = 2). Furthermore, we observed a significant 
difference in termination and survival rates between isolated and non-isolated 
CF cases (27.6 vs. 77.8% and 59.6 vs. 19.4%, p < 0.001 for both).
CONCLUSION: our data indicate that WES has a high additional diagnostic yield 
for the molecular diagnosis of fetal CF, markedly enhancing existing prenatal 
diagnostic capabilities and expanding our understanding of intrauterine genetic 
disorders, thus assisting us to better interpret fetal phenotype in the future."
667,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy nonspecifically targets both tumor and healthy 
proliferating cells. Methionine deprivation using L-methioninase along with 
chemotherapy appears promising towards cancer management. The present study is 
an attempt to use a new combination of L-methioninase with Tamoxifen (TAM) to 
treat breast cancer in mice.
METHODS AND RESULTS: L-Methioninase from Methylobacterium sp. was partially 
purified (SPMet's) by cold acetone precipitation and lyophilized. Its 
cytotoxicity effect, alone and in combination with Tamoxifen, was evaluated in 
vitro (MCF-7) cells and in vivo (athymic nude mice) conditions. SPMet's was 
found to inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells with an IC50 value of 47.05 µg/ml, 
while the combination of SPMet's and TAM had an IC50 of 6.4 µg/ml. Athymic nude 
mice were grouped into: Group-I - Tumor control; Group-II - TAM; Group-III - 
SPMet's; Group-IV - SPMet's + TAM. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was maximum in 
Group-IV with 84.65% followed by Group-II with 65.12%. Hematological and 
Biochemical parameters in Group-II, III, and IV were restored to normal levels. 
Tumor histopathology showed increased apoptosis and necrosis in Group-IV. 
Caspases 3 & 8 gene upregulation was significantly higher in Group-IV than other 
treated groups, indicating higher efficacy of the combination approach.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study report about a combination of SPMet's and 
TAM on in vivo breast cancer model, with significantly higher anticancer 
activity and without noticeable side effects. The findings of this study have 
several important implications for future clinical studies."
668,"Overexpression of the Aux/IAA protein TaIAA15-1A from wheat improves drought 
tolerance by regulating the ABA signalling pathway in transgenic Brachypodium. 
Drought is a major abiotic stress that causes severe crop yield loss. Aux/IAA 
genes have been shown to be involved in drought stress responses. However, to 
the best of our knowledge, there has been little research on the molecular 
mechanism of the wheat Aux/IAA gene in the context of drought tolerance. In this 
study, we found that expression of the wheat Aux/IAA gene TaIAA15-1A was 
upregulated by PEG6000, NaCl, SA, JA, IAA and ABA. Transgenic plants 
overexpressing TaIAA15-1A showed higher drought tolerance than wild-type (WT) 
plants. The physiological analyses showed that the transgenic lines exhibited a 
higher survival rate, shoot length, and relative water content than the WT 
plants. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and 
peroxidase (POD) were enhanced in transgenic lines, causing a reduction in the 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion radical (O2-) contents. 
Transcriptome analysis showed that TaIAA15-1A overexpression alters the 
expression of these genes involved in the auxin signalling pathway, ABA 
signalling pathway, phenolamides and antioxidant pathways. The results of 
exogenous ABA treatment suggested that TaIAA15-1A overexpression increased 
sensitivity to ABA at the germination and postgermination stages compared to WT 
plants. These results indicate that TaIAA15-1A plays a positive role in plant 
drought tolerance by regulating ABA-related genes and improving antioxidative 
stress ability and has potential application in genetically modified crops."
669,"Recent evidence suggests that the prognostic impact of gene mutations in 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may differ depending on the 
immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene somatic hypermutation (SHM) status. In 
this study, we assessed the impact of nine recurrently mutated genes (BIRC3, 
EGR2, MYD88, NFKBIE, NOTCH1, POT1, SF3B1, TP53, and XPO1) in pre-treatment 
samples from 4580 patients with CLL, using time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) as the 
primary end-point in relation to IGHV gene SHM status. Mutations were detected 
in 1588 (34.7%) patients at frequencies ranging from 2.3-9.8% with mutations in 
NOTCH1 being the most frequent. In both univariate and multivariate analyses, 
mutations in all genes except MYD88 were associated with a significantly shorter 
TTFT. In multivariate analysis of Binet stage A patients, performed separately 
for IGHV-mutated (M-CLL) and unmutated CLL (U-CLL), a different spectrum of gene 
alterations independently predicted short TTFT within the two subgroups. While 
SF3B1 and XPO1 mutations were independent prognostic variables in both U-CLL and 
M-CLL, TP53, BIRC3 and EGR2 aberrations were significant predictors only in 
U-CLL, and NOTCH1 and NFKBIE only in M-CLL. Our findings underscore the need for 
a compartmentalized approach to identify high-risk patients, particularly among 
M-CLL patients, with potential implications for stratified management."
670,"Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic/single-gene disorders (PGT-M) is a 
procedure employed in the field of assisted reproductive technology to avoid the 
transmission of genetic diseases to the offspring. Hereditary cancer syndromes 
represent a diffuse and accepted indication for PGT-M, but take-up differs among 
the different disorders. Its use is markedly lower for the genes causing Lynch 
syndrome compared with the breast cancer type 1 or 2 susceptibility genes 
(BRCA1/2), despite the similar prevalence and severity of the two conditions. 
Reasons to explain this difference have not been explored. First, Lynch syndrome 
may be more frequently undiagnosed compared with hereditary breast and ovarian 
cancer syndrome. In addition, the different take-up may be due to different 
patient perceptions of the conditions and of the management options. Finally, 
this distinct attitude may depend on the awareness and sensibility of the 
professionals caring for affected patients. The authors' considerations are, 
however, speculative, and specific studies aimed at disentangling the causes of 
the different receptions of PGT-M are warranted to understand how to tackle this 
gap. In the meantime, we believe that empowerment regarding PGT-M of all 
individuals with hereditary cancer syndromes, including Lynch syndrome, is 
ethically due, and plead for a more active involvement of caregivers."
671,"BACKGROUND: RNA-based genomic risk assessment estimates chemotherapy benefit in 
patients with hormone-receptor positive (HR+)/Human Epidermal Growth Factor 
2-negative (ERBB2-) breast cancer (BC). It is virtually used in all patients 
with early HR+/ERBB2- BC regardless of clinical recurrence risk.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of adult 
patients with early-stage (T1-3; N0; M0) HR+/ERBB2- BC who underwent genomic 
testing using the Oncotype DX (Exact Sciences) 21-genes assay. Clinicopathologic 
features were collected to assess the clinical recurrence risk, in terms of 
clinical risk score (CRS) and using a composite risk score of distant recurrence 
Regan Risk Score (RRS). CRS and RRS were compared to the genomic risk of 
recurrence (GRS).
RESULTS: Between January 2015 and December 2020, 517 patients with early-stage 
disease underwent genomic testing, and clinical data was available for 501 of 
them. There was statistically significant concordance between the 3 
prognostication methods (P < 0.01). Within patients with low CRS (n = 349), 
9.17% had a high GRS, compared to 8.93% in patients with low RRS (n = 280). In 
patients with grade 1 histology (n = 130), 3.85% had a high GRS and 68.46% had 
tumors > 1 cm, of whom only 4.49% had a high GRS. Tumor size > 1cm did not 
associate with a high GRS.
CONCLUSION: Genomic testing for patients with grade 1 tumors may be safely 
omitted, irrespective of size. Our finds call for a better understanding of the 
need for routine genomic testing in patients with low grade/low clinical risk of 
recurrence."
672,"Polycythemia vera (PV) is a Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm 
characterized by excessive myeloid cells production, mostly secondary to 
mutations in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene. PV natural history might be 
burdened by thrombotic events (TEs) and evolution into post-PV myelofibrosis 
(PPV-MF) or blast phase (BP). To date, no treatment strategies have been shown 
to have disease modifying effects, so therapy is directed at preventing TEs. All 
patients require phlebotomies (PHLs) to keep hematocrit below 45% and once-daily 
low dose aspirin (if not contraindicated). Apart from patients at ""high risk"" 
because of age over 60 years or a thrombosis history, cytoreductive therapies 
(CT) should be given to patients with relevant signs of myeloproliferation or 
intolerance to PHLs. Approved choices both for first and second line CT are 
hydroxyurea (HU) and pegylated forms of interferon (peg-IFN), the latter 
probably being better for young patients, and subjects without critical and 
recent vascular events or massive splenomegaly. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib 
is the treatment of choice in case of resistance/intolerance to HU, with proved 
efficacy in terms of thrombotic prevention. Data are too preliminary to consider 
CT for ""low risk"" PV cases, but ropeg-IFN is being studied in this setting with 
a short follow-up. A careful monitoring for signs of evolution into PPV-MF is 
fundamental for optimizing patient management."
673,"BACKGROUND: While microbiome and host regulation contribute independently to 
many disease states, it is unclear how circumcision in pediatric population 
influences subsequent changes in penile microbiome.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to analyze jointly paired taxonomic profiles and 
assess pathways implicated in inflammation, barrier protection, and energy 
metabolism.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed 11 paired samples, periurethral 
collection, before and after circumcision, to generate microbiome and mycobiome 
profiling. Sample preparation of 16S ribosomal RNA and internal transcribed 
spacer sequencing was adapted from the methods developed by the National

OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We obtained the predictive 
functional attributes of the microbial communities between samples using 
Silva-Tax4Fun and the Greengenes-Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by 
Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) approach. The predictive 
functioning of the microbial communities was determined by linearly combining 
the normalized taxonomic abundances into the precomputed association matrix of 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthology reference profiles.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Several notable microbiome and mycobiome compositional 
differences were observed between pre- and postcircumcision patients. Pairwise 
comparisons across taxa revealed a significant decrease (p < 0.05, false 
discovery rate corrected) of microbiome organisms (Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, 
and Campylobacterales) and mycobiome (Saccharomycetales and Pleosporales) 
following circumcision. A total of 14 pathways were found to differ in abundance 
between the pre- and postcircumcision groups (p < 0.005, false discovery rate 
<0.1 and linear discriminant analysis score >3; five enriched and nine 
depleted). The pathways reduced after circumcision were mostly involved with 
amino acid and glucose metabolism, while pathways prior to circumcision were 
enriched in genetic information processing and transcription processes. As 
expected, enrichment in methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein, an integral 
membrane protein involved in directed motility of microbes to chemical cues and 
environment, occurred prior to circumcision, while the filamentous hemagglutinin 
pathway (a strong immunogenic protein) was depleted after circumcision 
CONCLUSIONS: Our results offer greater insight into the host-microbiota 
relationship of penile circumcision and may serve to lay the groundwork for 
future studies focused on drivers of inflammation, infection, and oncogenesis.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Our study showed a significant reduction in bacteria and fungi 
after circumcision, particularly anaerobic bacteria, which are known to be 
potential inducers of inflammation and cancer. This is the first study of its 
kind showing the changes in microbiome after circumcision, and some of the 
changes that occur in healthy infants after circumcision that may explain the 
differences in cancer and inflammatory disorders in adulthood."
674,"As a well-known marine metal element, Cd can significantly affect bivalve 
mollusk life processes such as growth and development. However, the effects of 
Cd on the molecular mechanisms of the economically important cephalopod species 
Sepia esculenta remain unclear. In this study, S. esculenta larval immunity 
exposed to Cd is explored based on RNA-Seq. The analyses of GO, KEGG, and 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of 1,471 differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) reveal that multiple immune processes are affected by exposure such 
as inflammatory reaction and cell adhesion. Comprehensive analyses of KEGG 
signaling pathways and the PPI network are first used to explore Cd-exposed S. 
esculenta larval immunity, revealing the presence of 16 immune-related key and 
hub genes involved in exposure response. Results of gene and pathway functional 
analyses increase our understanding of Cd-exposed S. esculenta larval immunity 
and improve our overall understanding of mollusk immune functions."
675,"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly found in marine 
and estuarine environments and is endemic among the global shrimp aquaculture 
industry. V. parahaemolyticus proteins PirA and PirB have been determined to be 
major virulence factors that contribute significantly to the development of 
acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease. Our previous work had demonstrated the 
lethality of recombinant PirA and PirB proteins to Pacific white shrimp 
(Liptopenaeus vannamei). To understand the host response to these proteins, 
recombinant PirA and PirB proteins were administered using a reverse gavage 
method and individual shrimp were then sampled over time. Shrimp hepatopancreas 
libraries were generated and RNA sequencing was performed on the control and 
recombinant PirA/B-treated samples. Differentially expressed genes were 
identified among the assayed time points. Differentially expressed genes that 
were co-expressed at the later time points (2-, 4- and 6-h) were also identified 
and gene associations were established to predict functional physiological 
networks. Our analysis reveals that the recombinant PirA and PirB proteins have 
likely initiated an early host response involving several cell survival 
signaling and innate immune processes."
676,"The use of standard next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to detect key 
mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes for glioma diagnosis imposes 
several challenges including high capital cost and turnaround delays associated 
with the need for batch testing. Both for glioma testing, as well as for testing 
in other tumor types where highly specific mutation identification is required, 
the high throughput nature of NGS limits the feasibility of using it as a 
primary approach in clinical laboratories. We hypothesized that third generation 
nanopore sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) has the capability to 
overcome these limitations. This study aimed to develop and validate a 
nanopore-based IDH mutation detection assay for clinical practice using glioma 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Glioma FFPE (n=66) samples with 
confirmed IDH gene mutational status were sequenced on ONT's MinION device using 
an amplicon-based approach. All cases were concordant when compared to the 
reference results. Limit of blank and limit of detection for the variant allele 
fraction were 1.5% and 3.3% respectively at 500x read depth per gene. Total 
sequencing cost per sample was $50-$134 CAD with results being available in 9-15 
hours. These findings demonstrate that nanopore-sequencing technology can be 
leveraged to develop low cost, high performance clinical sequencing-based assays 
with quick turn-around times, to support the detection of targeted mutations in 
FFPE tumor tissue."
677,"Fiber growing inside the cotton bolls is a highly demandable product and its 
quality is key to the success of the textile industry. Despite the various 
efforts to improve cotton fiber staple length Pakistan has to import millions of 
bales to sustain its industrial needs. To improve cotton fiber quality Bacterial 
cellulose synthase (Bcs) genes (acsA, acsB) were expressed in a local cotton 
variety CEMB-00. In silico studies revealed a number of conserved domains both 
in the cotton-derived and bacterial cellulose synthases which are essential for 
the cellulose synthesis. Transformation efficiency of 1.27% was achieved by 
using Agrobacterium shoot apex cut method of transformation. The quantitative 
mRNA expression analysis of the Bcs genes in transgenic cotton fiber was found 
to be many folds higher during secondary cell wall synthesis stage (35 DPA) than 
the expression during elongation phase (10 DPA). Average fiber length of the 
transgenic cotton plant lines S-00-07, S-00-11, S-00-16 and S-00-23 was 
calculated to be 13.02% higher than that of the non-transgenic control plants. 
Likewise, the average fiber strength was found to be 20.92% higher with an 
enhanced cellulose content of 22.45%. The mutated indigenous cellulose synthase 
genes of cotton generated through application of CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in 6.03% 
and 12.10% decrease in fiber length and strength respectively. Furthermore, 
mature cotton fibers of transgenic cotton plants were found to have increased 
number of twists with smooth surface as compared to non-transgenic control when 
analyzed under scanning electron microscope. XRD analysis of cotton fibers 
revealed less cellulose crystallinity index in transgenic cotton fibers as 
compared to control fibers due to deposition of more amorphous cellulose in 
transgenic fibers as a result of Bcs gene expression. This study paved the way 
towards unraveling the fact that Bcs genes influence cellulose synthase activity 
and this enzyme helps in determining the fate of cotton fiber length and 
strength."
678,"Deoxynivalenol (DON) can easily injure the intestinal tract, which represents 
the first barrier against food contaminants. The intestinal toxicity induced by 
DON was mainly focused on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, 
however, the underlying mechanisms by which DON triggers apoptosis by other 
pathways remain poorly understood. In this study, the Janus kinase 2/signal 
transducers and activators of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT-3) pathway was proposed 
to regulate the intrinsic apoptosis induced by DON and thoroughly investigated 
in intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). First, DON was found to be 
able to efficiently inhibit cell viability and increase the release of lactate 
dehydrogenase. It could also enhance the activity of the cleaved caspase-3 in a 
time-dependent manner, accompanied by a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential 
and an up-regulation of the apoptosis rate. Then, the expression of genes 
associated with inflammation and apoptosis were investigated. DON increased the 
expression of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, SOCS3 and Bax, but decreased the expression of 
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Moreover, we discovered that DON robustly inhibited STAT-3 
activity together with the down-regulation of JAK2, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, 
paralleling the increase in p38 phosphorylation. Furthermore, a pharmacological 
activation of JAK2/STAT-3 alleviated DON induced-apoptosis. Concurrent with the 
apoptotic pathway, during the initial exposure to DON (first 4 h), a survival 
pathway involving phosphorylated Erk1/2, Akt, and FoxO1 was also observed. Thus, 
apoptosis induced by DON was Janus faced: although the survival pathway was 
activated, the DON-induced apoptotic JAK2/STAT-3/caspase-3 pathway dominated, 
leading to an imbalance in cell homeostasis. This study provides a novel avenue 
to comprehensively reveal the pathological mechanisms of DON-induced intestinal 
disorders, which is promising for future applications to other contaminants in 
food and feed."
679,"The cardiac neural crest is a subpopulation of cells arising from the caudal 
hindbrain. The delaminated cardiac neural crest cells migrate to the heart using 
the CXCR/SDF1 chemokine signaling system. These cells contribute to the 
formation of the cardiovascular system, including the septation of the outflow 
tract, which is unique to these cells. Here, we investigated the effect of 
ectopic expression of the cardiac neural crest gene MafB on trunk neural crest 
cells. First, we found that MafB has the potential to activate its own 
cis-regulatory element in enteric and trunk neural crest cells but not in 
cranial neural crest cells. Forced expression of two cardiac neural crest genes, 
Ets1 and Sox8, together with or without MafB, induced ectopic Sox10E2 enhancer 
activity in the trunk region. Finally, we uncovered that the expression of MafB, 
Ets1 and Sox8 can induce ectopic CXCR4 expression in the trunk neural crest 
cells, resulting in acquisition of responsiveness to the SDF1 signal. These 
results demonstrate that MafB, Ets1 and Sox8 are critical components for 
generation of the identity of the cardiac neural crest, especially the cell 
migration property."
680,"In recent years, a novel multiplex system containing two mini-short tandem 
repeats, 59 autosomal InDels, two Y-chromosomal InDels, and the Amelogenin gene 
with all amplicons less than 200 bp has been constructed and validated by 
ourselves for forensic degration sample, and its forensic application efficiency 
has been studied in Chinese some populations. Herein, the population genetic 
polymorphisms of these loci were investigated in Chinese Hui (n = 249) and 
Mongolian (n = 222) ethnic groups using direct multiplex amplification and 
capillary electrophoresis platform. The forensic identification efficiencies of 
this self-developed system were further evaluated in these two groups. And the 
results showed that the values of the combined power of discrimination were 
0.9999999999999999999999999999006 (Hui) and 0.999999999999999999999999999738 
(Mongolian), respectively. Moreover, the combined power of exclusion values were 
0.99999817 (Hui) and 0.99999779 (Mongolian). The 59 autosomal InDels used in 
this study exhibited high forensic identification efficiencies in 10 East Asian 
populations, which was also expected to be a new powerful tool for identifying 
degraded biological materials in East Asian populations."
681,"Bacillus altitudinis FD48 is a multifunctional plant growth-promoting bacterium 
isolated from the phylloplane of rice and survives at -10 bars of osmotic 
potential (-1.0 MPa). It also serves as an ideal PGPM against drought stress by 
triggering antioxidant defense mechanisms in rice. To further unravel the 
genetic determinants of osmotic stress tolerance and plant growth-promoting 
traits, the whole genome sequence of FD48 was compared with its related strains. 
The whole genome analysis revealed a single chromosome with a total length of 
3,752,533 bp (3.7 Mb) and an average G + C ratio of 41.19%. A total of 4029 
genes were predicted, of which 3964 (98.4%) were protein-encoding genes (PEGs) 
and 65 (1.6%) were non-protein-coding genes. The interaction of FD48 with the 
host plants is associated with many chemotactic and motility-related genes. The 
ability of FD48 to colonize plants and maintain plant growth under adverse 
environmental conditions was evidenced by the presence of genes for plant 
nutrient acquisition, phytohormone synthesis, trehalose, choline, and glycine 
betaine biosynthesis, microbial volatile organic compounds (acetoin synthesis), 
heat and cold shock chaperones, translation elongation factor TU (Ef-Tu), 
siderophore production, DEAD/DEAH boxes, and non- ribosomal peptide synthase 
clusters (bacilysin, fengycin, and bacitracin). This study sheds light on the 
drought stress-resilient mechanism, metabolic pathways and potential activity, 
and plant growth-promoting traits of B. altitudinis FD48 at the genetic level."
682,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Rougan Formula (RG) has long been clinically 
applied to treat hepatic fibrosis in patients with different chronic liver 
diseases. However, the core active substances and the potential pharmacological 
mechanisms of RG remain unclear.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study is to explore bioactive components, 
key targets, and potential mechanisms of RG by performing network 
pharmacological analyses and experimental model validation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All chemical components in RG extract were identified 
using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight tandem 
mass technology. The candidate components and drug targets of RG, as well as 
disease-related genes, were extracted from TCMSP and GeneCards databases. The 
potential pathways related to genes were predicted by Gene Ontology and Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses. The core 
bioactive components, key targets, and signaling pathways were ultimately 
obtained by analyzing protein-protein interaction (PPI) and 
component-target-pathway (C-T-P) networks. Subsequently, the efficacy and 
underlying mechanisms of RG on hepatic fibrosis were experimentally validated in 
transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)-induced hepatic stellate cell 
activation model and CCL4-induced hepatic fibrosis mouse model.
RESULTS: A total of 52 components in RG extract were obtained, and 22 of them 
were selected as the core bioactive components. Five hundred and thirty-nine 
overlapped targets were determined by matching drug targets with disease-related 
targets. The results of PPI and C-T-P network analyses revealed 100 key targets 
and 19 signaling pathways associated with RG efficacy. In vitro and in vivo 
studies further verified that RG exerted a significant anti-hepatic fibrotic 
effect by suppressing the activation of hepatic stellate cells by downregulating 
the TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: These results may provide some evidence for further clinical 
research and development of RG formula as an effective and safe drug for hepatic 
fibrosis treatment."
683,"The tumor-suppressive activity of p53 is largely attributed to its ability to 
induce cell death, including apoptosis through transcription-dependent and 
-independent mechanisms. On the one hand, nuclear p53 transcriptionally 
activates the expression of a myriad of pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family genes, such 
as NOXA, PUMA, BID, BAD, BIK, BAX, etc., whereas inactivates the expression of 
anti-apoptotic BCL-2, BCL-XL, and MCL1, leading to mitochondrial apoptosis. On 
the other hand, cytoplasmic p53 also promotes mitochondrial apoptosis by 
directly associating with multiple BCL-2 family proteins in the mitochondria. 
Apoptosis-related protein in TGF-β signaling pathway (ARTS), a 
mitochondria-localized pro-apoptotic protein encoded by an alternative spliced 
variant of the SEPT4 gene, triggers apoptosis by facilitating proteasomal 
degradation of BCL-2 and XIAP upon pro-apoptotic stimuli. We recently identified 
SEPT4/ARTS as a new p53 target gene in response to genotoxic stress. ARTS in 
turn binds to p53, drives its mitochondrial localization, and enhances the 
interaction between p53 and BCL-XL, thereby promoting mitochondrial apoptosis. 
This review will illustrate the mechanisms of p53-induced mitochondrial 
apoptosis, offer some recently discovered new insights into the ARTS functions 
in regulating mitochondrial cell death, and discuss the clinical significance of 
ARTS in cancer and non-cancer diseases."
684,"The influence of mineralogy on the assembly of microbial communities in glacial 
environments has been difficult to assess due to complications in isolating 
mineralogy from other variables. Here we assess the abundance and composition of 
microbial communities that colonized defined minerals incubated for 12 months in 
two meltwater streams (N and S) emanating from Kaldalónsjökull (Kal), a 
basalt-hosted glacier in Iceland. The two streams shared similar meltwater 
geochemistry as well as bedrock and proglacial sediment elemental compositions. 
Yet genomic DNA and PCR-amplifiable 16S rRNA genes were detected only in Kal S. 
The amount of recoverable DNA was highest for hematite incubated in Kal S and 
the composition of 16S rRNA genes recovered from Kal S sediments was most like 
those recovered from hematite and magnetite, an effect driven largely by 
similarities in the relative abundance of the putative hydrogenotrophic iron 
reducer Rhodoferax. We suggest this is attributable to comminution and 
weathering reactions involving exposed iron silicate minerals that generate and 
release hydrogen and Fe(III) that can be coupled to support microbial metabolism 
in Kaldalónsjökull, and possibly other basaltic habitats. The low abundance of 
cells in Kal N could be due to low availability of Fe(III) or another substrate."
685,"Goose astrovirus (GoAstV), goose parvovirus (GPV), and goose circovirus (GoCV) 
infections have similar symptoms, such as severe diarrhea, and cause serious 
economic losses to the goose industry globally. Therefore, it is necessary to 
develop a rapid and accurate method for the differential diagnosis of the 3 
viruses. In this study, a TaqMan probe-based multiplex reverse 
transcription-qualitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method was 
established and optimized for simultaneous detection of the three viruses. Three 
pairs of specific primers and probes were designed considering the conserved 
sequences of ORF2, VP3, and Rep of GoAstV, GPV, and GoCV, respectively. 
Singleplex real-time RT-qPCR detected a minimum of 10 copies of these genes, 
while multiplex real-time RT-qPCR detected a minimum of 100 copies. The 
correlation coefficients exceeded 0.99, and the amplification efficiency was 80 
to 100%. The assay had high sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability. In 85 
tissue samples, GoAstV and GPV were the main pathogens and demonstrated 
co-infection. This assay provides a rapid, efficient, specific, and sensitive 
tool for the detection of GoAstV, GPV, and GoCV. This can facilitate disease 
management and epidemiological surveillance."
686,"In this descriptive study, we used metagenomics to analyze the relationship 
between the morphological aspects of chicken feces and its respective bacterial 
compositions. The microbiota composition was determined by sequencing the V4 
region of the 16S rRNA genes collected from fresh broiler feces at 19 d old. In 
total, 48 samples were collected and divided into 8 groups of 6 samples each. 
The morphological changes studied were feed passage (FP) and reddish mucus (RM). 
Each was classified into 3 levels of intensity: 1 (slight), 2 (moderate), or 3 
(intense). Thus, the 8 groups studied were feed passage (FP-1; FP-2; FP-3), 
reddish mucus (RM-1; RM-2; RM-3), normal ileal feces (NIF), and cecal discharge 
(CD). The alpha diversity (Shannon's index) revealed that the CD group showed 
greater diversity, and was significantly different from FP-2, FP-3, and RM-1. 
The beta diversity showed that the CD group samples were more homogeneous than 
the ileal feces groups. The relative abundance analysis revealed that Firmicutes 
and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla in the ileal feces groups. In 
CD, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant. The relative abundance 
at the genus level revealed 136 different bacterial genera. In the ileal feces 
groups, the two most abundant genera were Lactobacillus and 
Escherichia/Shigella, except in the FP-1 and RM-2 groups, which had the opposite 
order. Unlike the others, the CD group had a higher abundance of Bacteroides and 
Faecalibacterium. When comparing the NIF group with the others, significant 
changes were found in the fecal microbiota, with nine genera for the FP groups, 
19 for the RM groups, and 61 when compared to CD. The results of the present 
study suggest that evaluation of fecal morphology is a fundamental task that 
makes it possible to act quickly and assertively, as the morphological aspects 
of the feces may be related to the composition and structure of fecal 
microbiota."
687,"The present study was performed to investigate the effect of oral administration 
of β-glucan (G70), a product obtained from the cell wall of yeast, on Newcastle 
disease virus (NDV)-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers, lymphocyte 
proliferation, and the role of T lymphocyte subpopulations in chickens treated 
with live NDV vaccine. In addition, the influence of β-glucan on splenic gene 
expression was investigated by transcriptome sequencing. The results revealed 
that the supplementation of β-glucan boosted the titer of serum NDV HI increased 
the NDV stimulation index of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and intestinal 
tract, and promoted the differentiation of T lymphocytes into CD4+ T cells. The 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis demonstrated that G70 upregulated the mRNA 
expressions related to G-protein coupled receptor and MHC class I polypeptide, 
and downregulated the mRNA expressions related to cathelicidin and 
beta-defensin. The immunomodulatory effect of G70 might function through 
mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. To sum up, G70 could boost 
the immunological efficacy of live NDV vaccine in chickens and could be applied 
as a potential adjuvant candidate in the poultry industry."
688,"The crop of pigeon has specific characteristics as producing crop milk in the 
lactating period. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the regulation of 
crop lactation remain unclear. miRNAs, the essential regulators of gene 
expression, are implicated in various physiological and biological activities. 
In this study, we discovered a new miRNA that regulated 
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta (PIK3CD) 
and crop fibrocyte proliferation. Results of the luciferase reporter assay 
suggested that miR-193-5p suppressed PIK3CD expression by targeting a conserved 
binding site in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of PIK3CD mRNA. MiR-193-5p 
promoted crop fibrocyte proliferation and migration, whereas PIK3CD inhibited 
these effects. These findings suggested an important regulatory role of 
miR-193-5p in crop fibrocyte proliferation, suggesting that miR-193-5p and 
PIK3CD might be important regulators of crop milk production."
689,"This study aimed to explore the effects of trans-anethole (TA) on 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute jejunal inflammation model of broilers. A 
total of 160 one-day-old broilers (male; Arbor Acres) were randomly allocated 
into four treatment groups with 8 replicates of 5 birds each. On d 20, the dose 
of 5 mg/kg body weight LPS solution and the equal amount of sterile saline were 
intraperitoneally injected into LPS-challenged and unchallenged broilers, 
respectively. Compared with the control group, LPS decreased (P < 0.05) the 
villus height (VH) and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth (VCR) but 
increased (P < 0.05) the crypt depth (CD), meanwhile, enhanced (P < 0.01) the 
levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α) but decreased (P < 0.01) the level of interleukin-10 
(IL-10). The group supplemented with 600 mg/kg of TA had lower (P < 0.01) CD and 
higher (P < 0.01) VCR than the LPS group. TA increased (P < 0.01) the level of 
IL-10 and decreased (P < 0.01) the level of IL-1β. The mRNA expression levels of 
IL-6, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), TNF-α were up-regulated (P < 0.05) and the 
levels of IL-10 and inhibitor of NF-κB alpha (IκBα) were down-regulated (P < 
0.05) by LPS as compared with the control group. TA down-regulated (P < 0.05) 
the increased mRNA expression levels of genes caused by LPS, as well as 
up-regulated (P < 0.05) the levels of IL-10 and IκBα. Furthermore, LPS 
down-regulated (P < 0.05) and up-regulated (P < 0.05) the protein expression 
levels of IκBα and NF-κB p65, respectively. TA up-regulated (P < 0.05) the level 
of IκBα and down-regulated (P < 0.05) the level of NF-κB p65. The conclusion of 
this study is that TA could exert protective effect on the LPS-induced acute 
jejunal inflammation of broilers via repressing the activation of NF-κB and the 
600 mg/kg is the optimal dose against LPS-induced acute jejunal inflammation of 
broilers."
690,"CONTEXT: Emerging evidence indicates that variants of alcohol-metabolizing 
enzymes may influence lipid metabolism.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether the rs671 and rs1229984 
variants affect lipid levels in East Asian individuals.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Foreign Medical Journal Service, Embase, Cochrane Library, 
Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Web of Knowledge, Wanfang, and Chinese 
Biomedical Literature databases were searched until December 31, 2021.
DATA EXTRACTION: Meta-analyses of studies that examined the effects of 
alcohol-metabolizing enzyme variants on lipid levels, as well as the interaction 
with alcohol intake, were selected. Data extraction was conducted independently 
by two investigators and confirmed by the third.
DATA ANALYSIS: In total, 86 studies (179 640 individuals) were analyzed. The A 
allele of rs671 (a functional variant in the ALDH2 gene) was linked to higher 
levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lower levels of 
triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In contrast, the A 
allele of the rs1229984 (a functional variant in the ADH2 gene) was associated 
only with lower levels of LDL-C. The effects of rs671 and rs1229984 on lipid 
levels were much stronger in Japanese than in Chinese individuals and in males 
than in females. Regression analysis indicated that the effects of rs671 on 
lipid levels were independent of alcohol intake in an integrated East Asian 
population (ie, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean individuals). Intriguingly, 
alcohol intake had a statistical influence on lipid levels when the sample 
analyzed was restricted to Japanese individuals or to males.
CONCLUSIONS: The rs671 and rs1229984 variants of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes 
have significant effects on lipid levels and may serve as genetic markers for 
lipid dyslipidemia in East Asian populations. Circulating lipid levels in 
Japanese individuals and in males were modulated by the interaction between 
rs671 and alcohol intake."
691,"Meniere Disease (MD) is an idiopathic inner ear disease with complex etiology 
and pathogenesis, which is still unclear. With the development in gene analysis 
technology, the genetic research of MD has attracted extensive attention, 
resulting in a large number of studies on the research of the relationship 
between human genes and MD. This paper aims to review the studies on this topic 
in recent years. The studies mainly focused on the genetics of familial MD and 
the correlation between MD and potentially related functional genes. The results 
of these studies have demonstrated the complexity and diversity of the 
pathogenesis of MD with both genetic and epigenetic alterations, suggesting that 
MD might be related to inflammation, immunity, aqua and ion balance in the 
lymphatic fluid, virus infection, metabolism, and abnormal function of nerve 
conduction. The finding of rare mutations in TECTA, MYO7A and OTOG genes and 
other genes such as CDH23, PCDH15 and ADGRV1 in the same families suggest that 
the integrity of the stereocilia and their interaction with the tectorial and 
otolithic membranes could be involved in the pathophysiology of familial MD."
692,"BACKGROUND: Sporophila nigricollis, popularly known as Yellow-bellied Seedeater, 
is a commonly trafficked bird in Brazil. This study describes the complete 
mitogenome of the species and its phylogenetic position.
METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA sample was sequenced on MiSeq (Illumina®) sequencer. 
Reads were assembled to reference using Geneious. A total of 11,740 paired 
sequence reads were used to produce the complete mitochondrial DNA sequence with 
average coverage of 176x. The mitogenome was found to be circular in shape and 
consisted of 16,777 base pairs. The mitochondrial genome was annotated with 
MITOS and verified with ExPASy. Its structure contains two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) 
genes, 22 transporter RNA (tRNA) genes, 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) and one 
control region. Twelve of the 13 PCGs have ATG as start codon. Seven of the 13 
PCGs contain a TAA stop codon. Most of the tRNA genes and PCGs are encoded on 
the heavy strand. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted with MEGA using the 
maximum likelihood method. Sporophila nigricollis grouped together with other 
Thraupidae species.
CONCLUSION: This study presents the first complete mitogenome of Sporophila 
nigricollis and can be useful for research on evolution, ecology and 
conservation of this species."
693,"BACKGROUND: It is believed that viruses affect potato yield more than any other 
pathogens worldwide.
METHOD AND RESULTS: We report here on a survey of the four most common potato 
viruses in the Tokat Province of northern Turkey. Leaf samples were collected 
from potato plants showing signs of viral diseases in five districts of the 
province. Over 400 leaf samples were tested using RT-PCR with virus-specific 
primers. Among the one or more viruses detected in 218 (52%) leaf samples, 
Potato virus Y (PVY) was the most common (47.1%), followed by potato virus S 
(PVS; 16.7%), potato virus X (PVX; 6.0%) and potato leaf roll virus (PLRV; 
5.3%). The most common mixed infections were PVY + PVS (6.9%). A phylogenetic 
analysis of the gene sequences showed all Turkish PVS isolates to be clustered 
with the PVSO group, two PVY isolates with the PVYN-WI group and one isolate 
with the PVYNTN group. Turkish PVX isolates are in the Type X group of the two 
major PVX isolate groups. The Turkish PLRV isolates were separated into two 
major groups depending on the results of the phylogenetic analysis, with six 
cases in Group 1 and one in Group 2.
CONCLUSIONS: PVY, PVX, PVS and PLRV were detected in potato production areas in 
Tokat. A phylogenetic comparison of the gene sequences revealed all Turkish 
isolates to be immigrant members of the world populations of these viruses. Our 
results emphasize the importance of the strict quarantine control of plant 
materials entering Turkey."
694,"BACKGROUND: As an available cell line, mouse pluripotent P19 has been widely 
employed for neuronal differentiation studies. In this research, by applying the 
in vitro differentiation of this cell line into neuron-like cells through 
retinoic acid (RA) treatment, the roles of some genes including DNMT3B, ICAM1, 
IRX3, JAK2, LHX1, SOX9, TBX3 and THY1 in neural differentiation was 
investigated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Bioinformatics, microscopic, and transcriptional studies 
were conducted in a time-dependent manner after RA-induced neural 
differentiation. According to bioinformatics studies, we determined the 
engagement of the metabolic and developmental super-pathways and pathways in 
neural cell differentiation, particularly focusing on the considered genes. 
According to our qRT-PCR analyses, JAK2, SOX9, TBX3, LHX1 and IRX3 genes were 
found to be significantly overexpressed in a time-dependent manner (p < 0.05). 
In addition, the significant downregulation of THY1, DNMT3B and ICAM1 genes was 
observed during the experiment (p < 0.05). The optical microscopic investigation 
showed that the specialized extensions of the neuron-like cells were revealed on 
day 8 after RA treatment.
CONCLUSION: Accordingly, the neural differentiation of P19 cell line and the 
role of the considered genes during the differentiation were proved. However, 
our results warrant further in vivo studies."
695,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction is associated with worse 
clinical outcomes and high mortality, but no effective therapeutic intervention 
has been explored, reinforcing the urgent need to develop innovative strategies. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction underlies the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced 
myocardial dysfunction. Herein, we assessed the effect of mitochondrial 
transplantation on sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction in a rat model of cecal 
ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis.
METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n = 80, 12 weeks old, 250-300 g) were divided into 
groups with/without CLP-induced sepsis receiving mitochondrial transplantation 
in single or two repetitive injections (1 h or 1 and 7 h post-CLP, 
respectively). Mitochondria were isolated from donor rats and injected 
intravenously (400 µl of mitochondrial suspension containing 7.5 × 106 
mitochondria/ml of respiration buffer) in recipient groups. Twenty-four hours 
post-operation, LDH and cTn-I levels, mitochondrial functional endpoints, 
expression of mitochondrial biogenesis (SIRT-1 and PGC-1α) and fission/fusion 
(Drp1/Mfn1 and Mfn2) genes, and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) 
levels were evaluated. Survival was tested over 72 h post-operation.
RESULTS: Mitotherapy significantly improved 72-hours survival (P < .05) and 
decreased LDH and cTn-I levels (P < .01). It also restored mitochondrial 
function and expression of mitochondrial biogenesis and fusion genes, and 
decreased the expression of mitochondrial fission gene and the levels of 
inflammatory cytokines (P < .05 to P < .01). Mitotherapy with repetitive 
injections at 1 and 7 h post-CLP provided noticeable mitoprotection in 
comparison with the group receiving mitotherapy at single injection.
CONCLUSION: Mitotherapy improved mitochondrial function, biogenesis, and dynamic 
associated with SIRT-1/PGC-1α network and suppressed inflammatory response in 
CLP-induced sepsis model, therefore, offers a promising strategy to overcome 
life-threatening sepsis challenge."
696,"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of gene 
expression. Some studies have reported the association of polymorphisms in 
lncRNA genes with diabetes mellitus (DM) and its chronic complications, 
including diabetic kidney disease (DKD); however, the results are still 
inconclusive. Thus, we investigated the association of the rs3200401/MALAT1, 
rs1894720/MIAT, rs3931283/PVT1, rs11993333/PVT1, rs5749201/TUG1, and 
rs7158663/MEG3 polymorphisms with DKD in patients with type 2 DM (T2DM).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study comprised 902 patients with T2DM and DKD (cases) 
and 394 patients with T2DM without DKD (controls). The six polymorphisms of 
interest were genotyped by real-time PCR using TaqMan probes. Frequency of the 
rs3931283/PVT1 G/G genotype was 36.2% in cases and 31.9% in controls 
(P = 0.331). After adjustment for gender, glycated hemoglobin, HDL cholesterol, 
ethnicity, hypertension, and diabetic retinopathy, the G/G genotype was 
associated with risk for DKD (OR = 1.625, 95% CI 1.020-2.588; P = 0.041). The 
rs3931283/PVT1 G/G genotype was also associated with higher urinary albumin 
excretion levels compared to A allele carriers (P = 0.017). No difference was 
found in rs7158663/MEG3 genotype frequencies between T2DM controls and DKD 
patients (OR = 1.087, 95% CI 0.686-1.724; P = 0.722). However, the 
rs7158663/MEG3 G/G genotype was associated with protection against severe DKD 
(OR = 0.694, 95% CI 0.488-0.989; P = 0.043, for patients with severe DKD vs. 
T2DM controls). The rs7158663/MEG3 G/G genotype was also associated with lower 
creatinine levels (P = 0.007) and higher estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(P = 0.010) compared to A allele carriers. No association was found between the 
rs11993333/PVT1, rs3200401/MALAT1, rs1894720/MIAT, and rs5749201/TUG1 
polymorphisms and DKD or its laboratory markers.
CONCLUSION: The rs3931283/PVT1 G/G and rs7158663/MEG3 G/G are associated with 
DKD and markers of renal function in T2DM patients from a Brazilian population."
697,"This experiment was a network pharmacology research based on the theoretical 
system of traditional Chinese medicine. TCMSP database, PubChem database, RCSB 
database, and SwissTargetPrediction database were used to study the effective 
chemical constituents of Ligustri lucidi Fructus and Ecliptae Herba in Erzhiwan, 
a traditional prescription for nourishing the liver and kidney. Then Genecards 
database, OMIM database, OMIM Gene Map, and Metascape database were used to 
study the therapeutic targets of osteoporosis. At last, Cytoscape 3.6.0 
software, its built-in Bisogenet and CytoNCA, AutoDockTools-1.5.6 software, 
PYMOL-2.2.0 software, and Gromacs software, by drawing the relationship diagram 
between chemical components and disease targets, PPI network of disease, 
semi-flexible molecular docking technology, evaluation and analysis of 
enrichment pathway, and molecular dynamics simulation, were used to study the 
therapeutic mechanism of Erzhiwan on osteoporosis. It is found that the 
intervention and regulation of Erzhiwan on osteoporosis were mainly realized 
through multiple targets of active ingredients and multiple pathways, which 
provided support for the continued development of Erzhiwan."
698,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent research suggests that binge eating may be more 
prevalent among women in midlife than previously believed. The menopausal 
transition, an important developmental stage during midlife, is characterized by 
substantial fluctuations and eventual decreases in ovarian hormones that may 
contribute to increased risk. This narrative review summarizes findings from 
studies of binge eating during midlife and menopause and discusses the potential 
role of ovarian hormones in binge eating risk.
RECENT FINDINGS: Studies are few in number and findings are mixed, with only 
some studies showing increased binge eating during midlife and the menopausal 
transition. Sensitivity to ovarian hormones, potentially through gene x hormone 
interactions, may influence who experiences increased binge eating risk and 
could help explain mixed findings in the field. Future studies of hormone 
sensitivity and gene x hormone interactions are needed to further elucidate 
midlife and menopausal risk for binge eating in women."
699,"Filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger has gained significant industrial and 
ecological value due to its great potential in enzymatic activities. The present 
study reports the complete genome sequence of A. niger BSC-1 which was isolated 
from Indian Sundarban mangrove ecosystem. The study revealed that the genome of 
A. niger BSC-1 was 35.1 Mbp assembled in 40 scaffolds with 49.2% GC content. A 
total of 10,709 genes were reported out of which 10,535 genes were predicted for 
encoding the proteins. BUSCO assessment showed 98.6% of genome completeness 
indicating high quality genome sequencing. The genome sequencing of A. niger 
BSC-1 revealed the presence of rodA and exgA genes for initial adhesion to 
surface and Ags genes for matrix formation, during biofilm growth. OrthoVenn2 
analysis revealed that A.niger BSC-1 shared 9552 gene clusters with the 
reference strain A. niger CBS554.65. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis unveiled 
the role of Ags1 and P-type ATPase in fungal biofilm formation and chromium (Cr) 
resistance, respectively. During biofilm growth the expression of Ags1 
significantly (P < 0.0001; two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's multiple 
comparisons test) increased with respect to planktonic culture revealing the 
possible involvement of Ags1 in biofilm matrix formation. Expression of P-type 
ATPase gene was significantly upregulated (P < 0.0001; one-way ANOVA followed by 
Dunnett's multiple comparisons test) with the increasing chromium concentration 
in the fungal culture. Besides, several other genes encoding metalloprotease, 
copper and zinc binding proteins, and NADH-dependent oxidoreductase were also 
found in the genome of A. niger BSC-1. These proteins are also involved in heavy 
metal tolerance and nanofabrication indicating that this filamentous fungus A. 
niger BSC-1 could be potentially utilized for chromium detoxification through 
biofilm or nanobiremediation."
700,"PURPOSE: Mental health and sleep quality are associated with genetics and 
nutrient and energy intake. The present study examined the association between 
ultra-processed food (UPF) intake and genetic risk score (GRS) and their 
interactions on mental health and sleep quality in Iranian women.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 278 overweight and obese 
females aged between 18 and 56 years. According to the NOVA classification 
system, 37 food groups and beverages were collected using a 147-item 
semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The blood parameters of 
all participants were assessed. Mini-column kit (type G; Genall; Exgene) and the 
PCR-RFLP method were used to extract DNA and determine gene polymorphism, 
respectively. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including Caveolin_1 
(Cav_1), Melanocortin4 receptor (MC4R), and cryptochrome circadian regulator 1 
(CRY1), were used to calculate GRS. The individual risk allele (0, 1, 2) for 
each SNP was calculated using the incremental genetic model.
RESULTS: After controlling for confounders, a significant interaction was found 
for depression (β = 0.026, 95% CI 0.003, 0.049, P = 0.028) and depression 
anxiety stress scales (DASS) score (β = 0.059, 95% CI 0.001, 0.117, P = 0.046) 
on the NOVA classification system and GRS.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study showed a significant interaction between 
GRS and the NOVA classification system on mental disorders, including 
depression, DASS score and stress. There was also a significant relationship 
between the NOVA classification system and anxiety, DASS score, sleep quality 
and depression. Furthermore, a partially significant association was observed 
between GRS and stress.

701,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most aggressive malignant tumors in human 
beings. Tumor capacity of evading immune-mediated lysis is a critical step in PC 
malignant progression. We aimed to evaluate the underlying regulatory mechanism 
of miR-4299 in the proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis, and immune escape in 
PC. miR-4299 and ADAM17 expressions in PC tissues and cell lines were detected 
using qRT-PCR. MTT assay and flow cytometry were used to detect cell viability 
and apoptosis, respectively. A luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to 
confirm the targeted relationship between miR-4299 and ADAM17. Xenograft tumors 
in nude mice were used to detect tumorigenesis in vivo. PC cells were 
co-cultured with NK cells for determining the immune escape ability. 
NKG2D-positive rate of NK cells was detected using flow cytometry; NK 
cell-killing ability was detected using MTT assay. miR-4299 was downregulated in 
PC tissues and cell lines. miR-4299 inhibited PC cell proliferation and 
invasion, promoted cell apoptosis, and reduced PC tumor growth in vivo. ADAM17 
3'UTR directly bound to miR-4299. ADAM17 overexpression could reverse miR-4299 
effects on PC cell viability, invasion, apoptosis, and immune escape. miR-4299 
exerted suppressive effects on PC cell proliferation, invasion, and immune 
escape via targeting ADAM17 expression. This study revealed a novel 
miR-4299/ADAM17 axis-modulating PC progression and proposed to concern the 
immune regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in PC development."
702,"The persistence of plastics and its effects in different environments where they 
accumulate, particularly in coastal areas, is of serious concern. These plastics 
exhibit signs of degradation, possibly mediated by microorganisms. In this 
study, we investigated the potential of sediment microbial communities from 
Manila Bay, Philippines, which has a severe plastics problem, to degrade 
low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Plastics in selected sites were quantified and 
sediment samples from sites with the lowest and highest plastic accumulation 
were collected. These sediments were then introduced and incubated with LDPE in 
vitro for a period of 91 days. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy detected 
the appearance of carbonyl and vinyl products on the plastic surface, indicating 
structural surface modifications attributed to polymer degradation. Communities 
attached to the plastics were profiled using high-throughput sequencing of the 
V4-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Members of the phylum Proteobacteria 
dominated the plastic surface throughout the experiment. Several bacterial taxa 
associated with hydrocarbon degradation were also enriched, with some taxa 
positively correlating with the biodegradation indices, suggesting potential 
active roles in the partial biodegradation of plastics. Other taxa were also 
present, which might be consuming by-products or providing nourishment for other 
groups, indicating synergy in utilizing the plastic as the main carbon source 
and creation of a microenvironment within the plastics biofilm. This study 
showed that sediment microbes from Manila Bay may have naturally occurring 
microbial groups potentially capable of partially degrading plastics, supporting 
previous studies that the biodegradation potential for plastics is ubiquitously 
present in marine microbial assemblages."
703,"Bacterial biofilm formation is one of the dynamic processes, which facilitates 
bacteria cells to attach to a surface and accumulate as a colony. With the help 
of biofilm formation, pathogenic bacteria can survive by adapting to their 
external environment. These bacterial colonies have several resistance 
properties with a higher survival rate in the environment. Especially, 
pathogenic bacteria can grow as biofilms and can be protected from antimicrobial 
compounds and other substances. In aquaculture, biofilm formation by pathogenic 
bacteria has emerged with an increased infection rate in aquatic animals. 
Studies show that Vibrio anguillarum, V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, V. 
harveyi, V. campbellii, V. fischeri, Aeromonas hydrophila, A. salmonicida, 
Yersinia ruckeri, Flavobacterium columnare, F. psychrophilum, Piscirickettsia 
salmonis, Edwardsiella tarda, E. ictaluri, E. piscicida, Streptococcus 
parauberis, and S. iniae can survive in the environment by transforming their 
planktonic form to biofilm form. Therefore, the present review was intended to 
highlight the principles behind biofilm formation, major biofilm-forming 
pathogenic bacteria found in aquaculture systems, gene expression of those 
bacterial biofilms and possible controlling methods. In addition, the 
possibility of these pathogenic bacteria can be a serious threat to aquaculture 
systems."
704,"PURPOSE: Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a common health condition worldwide and 
a leading cause of disability with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 80-90% in 
industrialized countries. However, we have had limited success in treating cLBP 
likely due to its non-specific heterogeneous nature that goes beyond detectable 
anatomical changes. We propose that omics technologies as precision medicine 
tools are well suited to provide insight into its pathophysiology and provide 
diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. Therefore, in this review, we 
explore the current state of omics technologies in the diagnosis and 
classification of cLBP. We identify factors that may serve as markers to 
differentiate between acute and chronic cases of low back pain (LBP). Finally, 
we also discuss some challenges that must be overcome to successfully apply 
precision medicine to the diagnosis and treatment of cLBP.
METHODS: A literature search for the current applications of omics technologies 
to chronic low back pain was performed using the following search terms- ""back 
pain,"" ""low back pain,"" ""proteomics,"" ""transcriptomics"", ""epigenomics,"" 
""genomics,"" ""omics."" We reviewed molecular markers identified from 35 studies 
which hold promise in providing information regarding molecular insights into 
cLBP.
RESULTS: GWAS studies have found evidence for the role of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with pain pathways in individuals with cLBP. 
Epigenomic modifications in patients with cLBP have been found to be enriched 
among genes involved in immune signaling and inflammation. Transcriptomics 
profiles of patients with cLBP show multiple lines of evidence for the role of 
inflammation in cLBP. The glycomics profiles of patients with cLBP are similar 
to those of patients with inflammatory conditions. Proteomics and microbiomics 
show promise but have limited studies currently.
CONCLUSION: Omics technologies have identified associations between inflammatory 
and pain pathways in the pathophysiology of cLBP. However, in order to integrate 
information across the range of studies, it is important for the field to 
identify and adopt standardized definitions of cLBP and control patients. 
Additionally, most papers have applied a single omics method to a sampling of 
cLBP patients which have yielded limited insight into the pathophysiology of 
cLBP. Therefore, we recommend a multi-omics approach applied to large global 
consortia for advancing subphenotyping and better management of cLBP, via 
improved identification of diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets."
705,"Caffeic acid-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an important enzyme governing the 
process of lignification in plants, functions at the level of caffeic acid 
methylation along with 3-O-methylation of monolignol precursors. The present 
investigation was carried out to decipher the role of COMT in tall fescue 
lignification and to clone and characterize the COMT gene. The study on COMT 
activity variation at different growth stages of tall fescue exhibited a 
significant increase in activity over all the growth stages of tall fescue. A 
significant relative increase of 47.8% was observed from the first vegetative to 
reproductive stage. COMT activity exhibited a strong positive correlation with 
lignin content suggesting it to be an important enzyme of tall fescue 
lignification. Amplification and sequencing of tall fescue COMT gene resulted in 
an amplicon of size 1662 (Accession No.-MW442832) and an ORF of 346 amino acids. 
The deduced protein was hydrophobic, thermally stable and acidic with molecular 
formula C1679H2623N445O482S20, molecular mass 37.4 kDa and theoretical pI of 
6.12. The protein possesses a conserved dimerization domain with a highly 
conserved SAM binding site. The COMT protein was found to be a homo-dimer with 1 
catalytic SAH/SAM ligand per monomer interacting with 14 amino acid residues 
within 4 Å region."
706,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that can cause 
life-threatening nosocomial infections. The alarming increase in antibiotic 
resistance has led to an urgent need for alternative therapeutic approaches, 
such as phage therapy, which has shown promising results in many studies. In 
this study, P121, a new lytic Pseudomonas phage, was isolated and characterized. 
Whole-genome sequencing showed that it has a genome of 73,001 bp that contains 
91 predicted coding sequences. No genes involved in virulence or lysogeny were 
found in the genome, thus making it potentially safe for therapeutic 
applications. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis indicated that P121 is a member 
of the genus Litunavirus, family Schitoviridae. The present study provides some 
basic information for further research on treatment of P. aeruginosa infections."
707,"Ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase hinge protein (UQCRH) is required for the 
electron transfer between cytochrome c1 and c of the mitochondrial cytochrome 
bc1 Complex (CIII). A two-exon deletion in the human UQCRH gene has recently 
been identified as the cause for a rare familial mitochondrial disorder. 
Deletion of the corresponding gene in the mouse (Uqcrh-KO) resulted in striking 
biochemical and clinical similarities including impairment of CIII, failure to 
thrive, elevated blood glucose levels, and early death. Here, we set out to test 
how global ablation of the murine Uqcrh affects cardiac morphology and 
contractility, and bioenergetics. Hearts from Uqcrh-KO mutant mice appeared 
macroscopically considerably smaller compared to wildtype littermate controls 
despite similar geometries as confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). 
Relating TTE-assessed heart to body mass revealed the development of subtle 
cardiac enlargement, but histopathological analysis showed no excess collagen 
deposition. Nonetheless, Uqcrh-KO hearts developed pronounced contractile 
dysfunction. To assess mitochondrial functions, we used the high-resolution 
respirometer NextGen-O2k allowing measurement of mitochondrial respiratory 
capacity through the electron transfer system (ETS) simultaneously with the 
redox state of ETS-reactive coenzyme Q (Q), or production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS). Compared to wildtype littermate controls, we found decreased 
mitochondrial respiratory capacity and more reduced Q in Uqcrh-KO, indicative 
for an impaired ETS. Yet, mitochondrial ROS production was not generally 
increased. Taken together, our data suggest that Uqcrh-KO leads to cardiac 
contractile dysfunction at 9 weeks of age, which is associated with impaired 
bioenergetics but not with mitochondrial ROS production. Global ablation of the 
Uqcrh gene results in functional impairment of CIII associated with metabolic 
dysfunction and postnatal developmental arrest immediately after weaning from 
the mother. Uqcrh-KO mice show dramatically elevated blood glucose levels and 
decreased ability of isolated cardiac mitochondria to consume oxygen (O2). 
Impaired development (failure to thrive) after weaning manifests as a deficiency 
in the gain of body mass and growth of internal organ including the heart. The 
relative heart mass seemingly increases when organ mass calculated from 
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is normalized to body mass. Notably, the 
heart shows no signs of collagen deposition, yet does develop a contractile 
dysfunction reflected by a decrease in ejection fraction and fractional 
shortening."
708,"Macrophages play essential roles in erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling. 
β-thalassemia is characterized by a genetic defect in hemoglobin synthesis, 
which increases the rate of iron recycling. We previously showed that reduced 
expression of the BTB and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1) gene leads to increased 
phagocytosis of abnormal RBCs by activated monocytes. However, the mechanisms 
underlying this abnormal RBC clearance remained unclear. Herein, spleen and bone 
marrow cells of β-thalassemic mice were examined for erythrophagocytosis CD 
markers and iron-recycling genes. Higher expression levels of CD47 and CD163 on 
RBCs and macrophages, respectively, were observed in β-thalassemic mice than on 
wild-type cells. The decreased expression of Bach1 caused an increase in Nrf2, 
Spic, Slc40a1, and Hmox1 expression in splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs) of 
thalassemic mice. To investigate BACH1 regulation, a macrophage cell line was 
transfected with BACH1-siRNA. Decreased BACH1 expression caused an increase in 
CD163 expression; however, the expression levels were lower when the cells were 
cultured in media supplemented with β-thalassemia/HbE patient plasma. 
Additionally, the iron recycling-related genes SPIC, SLC40A1, and HMOX1, were 
significantly upregulated in BACH1-suppressed macrophages. Our findings provide 
insights into BACH1 regulation, which plays an important role in 
erythrophagocytosis and iron recycling in thalassemic macrophages. This article

709,"Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is a powerful tool to study the 
evolution of proteins and thus gain deep insight into the relationships between 
protein sequence, structure, and function. A major barrier to its broad use is 
the complexity of the task: it requires multiple software packages, complex file 
manipulations, and expert phylogenetic knowledge. Here we introduce topiary, a 
software pipeline that aims to overcome this barrier. To use topiary, users 
prepare a spreadsheet with a handful of sequences. Topiary then: 1) Infers the 
taxonomic scope for the ASR study and finds relevant sequences by BLAST; 2) Does 
taxonomically informed sequence quality control and redundancy reduction; 3) 
Constructs a multiple sequence alignment; 4) Generates a maximum-likelihood gene 
tree; 5) Reconciles the gene tree to the species tree; 6) Reconstructs ancestral 
amino acid sequences; and 7) Determines branch supports. The pipeline returns 
annotated evolutionary trees, spreadsheets with sequences, and graphical 
summaries of ancestor quality. This is achieved by integrating modern 
phylogenetics software (Muscle5, RAxML-NG, GeneRax, and PastML) with online 
databases (NCBI and the Open Tree of Life). In this paper, we introduce 
non-expert readers to the steps required for ASR, describe the specific design 
choices made in topiary, provide a detailed protocol for users, and then 
validate the pipeline using datasets from a broad collection of protein 
families. Topiary is freely available for download:

710,"H2AX is a histone H2A variant that becomes phosphorylated upon genotoxic stress. 
The phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX) plays an antioncogenic role in the DNA damage 
response and its foci patterns are highly variable, in terms of intensities and 
sizes. However, whether characteristic γ-H2AX foci patterns are associated with 
oncogenesis (oncogenic-specific γ-H2AX foci patterns) remains unknown. We 
previously reported that a defect in the acetyltransferase activity of TIP60 
promotes cancer cell growth in human cell lines. In this study, we compared 
γ-H2AX foci patterns between TIP60 wild-type cells and TIP60 HAT mutant cells by 
using machine learning. When focused solely on the intensity and size of γ-H2AX 
foci, we extracted the TIP60 HAT mutant-like oncogenic-specific γ-H2AX foci 
pattern among all datasets of γ-H2AX foci patterns. Furthermore, by using the 
dimensionality reduction method UMAP, we also observed TIP60 HAT mutant-like 
oncogenic-specific γ-H2AX foci patterns in TIP60 wild-type cells. In summary, we 
propose the existence of an oncogenic-specific γ-H2AX foci pattern and the 
importance of a machine learning approach to extract oncogenic signaling among 
the γ-H2AX foci variations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

711,"Hypoxic preconditioning is protective in multiple models of injury and disease, 
but whether it is beneficial for cells transplanted into sites of spinal cord 
injury (SCI) is largely unexplored. In this study, we analyzed whether 
hypoxia-related preconditioning protected Schwann cells (SCs) transplanted into 
the contused thoracic rat spinal cord. Hypoxic preconditioning was induced in 
SCs prior to transplantation by exposure to either low oxygen (1% O2 ) or 
pharmacological agents (deferoxamine or adaptaquin). All preconditioning 
approaches induced hypoxic adaptations, including increased expression of HIF-1α 
and its target genes. These adaptations, however, were transient and resolved 
within 24 h of transplantation. Pharmacological preconditioning attenuated 
spinal cord oxidative stress and enhanced transplant vascularization, but it did 
not improve either transplanted cell survival or recovery of sensory or motor 
function. Together, these experiments show that hypoxia-related preconditioning 
is ineffective at augmenting either cell survival or the functional outcomes of 
SC-SCI transplants. They also reveal that the benefits of hypoxia-related 
adaptations induced by preconditioning for cell transplant therapies are not 
universal."
712,"BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is a potential 
prognostic factor for tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC), and is associated 
with oral epithelial dysplasia grade in oral leukoplakia (OL).
METHODS: thirty cases of TSCC and thirty cases of OL were analyzed. FGFR1 and 
p-AKT protein expression were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, and quantified 
using a digital algorithm. FGFR1 gene amplification was analyzed by FISH in the 
TSCC cases.
RESULTS: Clinical appearance and dysplasia grade were correlated with OL 
malignant transformation. OL cases presenting high FGFR1 expression showed a 
higher risk of malignant transformation (p=0.016, HR: 7.3, 95%CI: 1.4-37.4). 
p-AKT showed faint to no expression in OL, which did not correlate with 
dysplasia grade or malignant transformation. High expression of FGFR1 and p-AKT 
were associated with poor OS and DFS in TSCC, although only FGFR1 expression was 
significantly associated to poor OS (p=0.024; HR: 4.9, 95%CI: 1.2-19.9). Cases 
presenting double FGFR1/p-AKT overexpression (n=8) showed markedly impaired OS 
(p=0.020; HR: 6.4, 95%CI: 1.3-31.1) and DFS (p=0.001, HR: 13.0, 95%CI: 
3.0-55.7). FGFR1 amplification was observed in 16.6% of TSCC cases, being 
correlated with vascular and neural invasion (p=0.001 and 0.017, respectively), 
but not with FGFR1 protein expression, OS, or DFS.
CONCLUSION: FGFR1 protein expression is an important prognostic factor in OL and 
TSCC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
713,"The human prion protein gene (PRNP) is mapped to the short arm of chromosome 20

the PRNP increases protein stability. In contrast, the mutation E200K, which has 
the highest mutation rate in the prion protein, causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
(CJD) in humans and induces protein aggregation. We aimed to identify the 
structural mechanisms of E200k and G127V mutations causing CJD. We used a 
variety of bioinformatic algorithms, including SIFT, PolyPhen, I-Mutant, 
PhD-SNP, and SNP& GO, to predict the association of the E200K mutation with 
prion disease. MD simulation is performed, and graphs for root mean square 
deviation, root mean square fluctuation, radius of gyration, DSSP, principal 
component analysis, porcupine, and free energy landscape are generated to 
confirm and prove the stability of the wild-type and mutant protein 
structures. The protein is analyzed for aggregation, and the results indicate 
more fluctuations in the protein structure during the simulation owing to the 
E200K mutation; however, the G127V mutation makes the protein structure stable 
against aggregation during the simulation."
714,"Background Homeostasis of the vessel wall is cooperatively maintained by 
endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells, and adventitial fibroblasts. The 
genetic deletion of fibulin-4 (Fbln4) in smooth muscle cells (SMKO) leads to the 
formation of thoracic aortic aneurysms with the disruption of elastic fibers. 
Although Fbln4 is expressed in the entire vessel wall, its function in ECs and 
relevance to the maintenance of valvulo-arterial integrity are not fully 
understood. Methods and Results Gene silencing of FBLN4 was conducted on human 
aortic ECs to evaluate morphological changes and gene expression profile. Fbln4 
double knockout (DKO) mice in ECs and smooth muscle cells were generated and 
subjected to histological analysis, echocardiography, Western blotting, RNA 
sequencing, and immunostaining. An evaluation of the thoracic aortic aneurysm 
phenotype and screening of altered signaling pathways were performed. Knockdown 
of FBLN4 in human aortic ECs induced mesenchymal cell-like changes with the 
upregulation of mesenchymal genes, including TAGLN and MYL9. DKO mice showed the 
exacerbation of thoracic aortic aneurysms when compared with those of SMKO and 
upregulated Thbs1, a mechanical stress-responsive molecule, throughout the 
aorta. DKO mice also showed progressive aortic valve thickening with collagen 
deposition from postnatal day 14, as well as turbulent flow in the ascending 
aorta. Furthermore, RNA sequencing and immunostaining of the aortic valve 
revealed the upregulation of genes involved in endothelial-to-mesenchymal 
transition, inflammatory response, and tissue fibrosis in DKO valves and the 
presence of activated valve interstitial cells. Conclusions The current study 
uncovers the pivotal role of endothelial fibulin-4 in the maintenance of 
valvulo-arterial integrity, which influences thoracic aortic aneurysm 
progression."
715,"AIMS: Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, including 
dapagliflozin, improve β cell function in type 2 diabetic individuals. Whether 
dapagliflozin can protect islet microvascular endothelial cells (IMECs) and thus 
contribute to the improvement of β cell function remains unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The db/db mice were treated with dapagliflozin or vehicle 
for 6 weeks. β cell function, islet capillaries and the levels of inflammatory 
chemokines in IMECs were detected. The mouse IMEC cell line MS-1 cells were 
incubated with palmitate and/or dapagliflozin for 24 h. Angiogenesis and 
inflammatory chemokine levels were evaluated, and the involved signaling 
pathways were analyzed. The mouse β cell line MIN6 cells, in the presence or 
absence of co-culture with MS-1 cells, were treated with palmitate and/or 
dapagliflozin for 24 h. The expression of β cell specific markers and insulin 
secretion in MIN6 cells were determined.
RESULTS: Dapagliflozin significantly improved β cell function, increased islet 
capillaries and decreased the levels of inflammatory chemokines of IMECs in 
db/db mice. In the palmitate-treated MS-1 cells, angiogenesis was enhanced and 
the levels of inflammatory chemokines were downregulated by dapagliflozin. 
Either PI3K inhibitor or mTOR inhibitor eliminated the dapagliflozin-mediated 
effects. Importantly, dapagliflozin attenuated the palmitate-induced 
downregulation of β cell function-related gene expression and decrease of 
insulin secretion in MIN6 cells co-cultured with MS-1 cells but not in those on 
mono-culture.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin restores islet vascularization and attenuates the 
inflammation of IMECs in type 2 diabetic mice. The dapagliflozin-induced 
improvement of β cell function is at least partially accounted for by its 
beneficial effects on IMECs in a PI3K/Akt-mTOR-dependent manner. This article is

716,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily affects older adults. In this report, we 
present the case of a 19-year-old male with gradual memory decline for 2 years 
and World Health Organization-University of California Los Angeles Auditory 
Verbal Learning Test (WHO-UCLA AVLT) results also showing memory impairment. 
Positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging with 18F 
fluorodeoxyglucose revealed atrophy of the bilateral hippocampus and 
hypometabolism in the bilateral temporal lobe. Examination of the patient's 
cerebrospinal fluid showed an increased concentration of p-tau181 and a 
decreased amyloid-β 42/40 ratio. However, through whole-genome sequencing, no 
known gene mutations were identified. Considering the above, the patient was 
diagnosed with probable AD."
717,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the major human 
health challenges with minimal therapeutic benefits due to its late detection, 
and de novo - and acquired chemotherapy resistance.
OBJECTIVE: In this work we unravel the potential pro-survival role of RAB25 in 
pancreatic cancer chemotherapy resistance and aim to identify if RAB25is a 
prognostic marker of patients' survival in PDA.
METHODS: We used RNA sequencing, shRNA mediated gene knockdown, BioGRID open 
repository of CRISPR screens (ORCS), GEPIA, kmplot.com, and cBioPortal.org 
databases to identify the role of RAB25 in PDA cell proliferation, chemotherapy 
response, expression in tumour versus normal tissues, and overall patients' 
survival.
RESULTS: RNA sequencing show Rab25 to be one of the top upregulated genes in 
gemcitabine resistant mouse PDA cells. Knockdown of Rab25 in these cells 
enhanced gemcitabine toxicity. In addition, re-analysis of previously published 
CRISPR/Cas9 data confirm RAB25 to be responsible for chemotherapy resistance in 
KRASG12D mutant human pancreatic cancer cell line. Finally, we used publicly 
available TCGA datasets and identify the upregulation of RAB25 in tumour tissues 
compared to the adjacent normal tissue, co-occurrence of KRASG12 mutations with 
RAB25 amplifications, and poor patients' survival in cohorts with higher mRNA 
expression of RAB25.
CONCLUSION: RAB25 expression is a prognostic marker for patient's survival and 
gemcitabine resistance in PDA."
718,"BACKGROUND: Combining the entomopathogenic nematode (EPN), Heterorhabditis 
beicherriana LF strain and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) HBF-18 strain is a 
practical strategy to manage the larvae of Holotrichia parallela Motschulsky 
(white grubs). However, the mechanisms underlying the larval defense response to 
this combined biocontrol strategy are unknown.
RESULTS: Herein, the activities of some antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT) and 
some detoxifying enzymes (AChE, P-450, CarE, GST) in grubs showed an 
activation-inhibition trend throughout the EPN-Bt exposure time course. Eight 
potentially key antioxidant and detoxifying enzyme genes in response to EPN-Bt 
infection were identified from the midgut of grubs through RNA-seq. After 
silencing CAT, CarE18, and GSTs1, the enzyme activities were significantly 
decreased by 30.29%, 68.80%, and 34.63%, respectively. Meanwhile, the mortality 
of grubs was increased by 18.40%, 46.30%, and 42.59% after exposure to EPN-Bt 
for 1 day. Interestingly, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was significantly 
enriched in KEGG enrichment analysis, and the expression levels of 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), cap 'n' collar 
isoform-C (CncC), kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), and CarE18 were 
all upregulated when exposed to EPN-Bt for 1 day. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated 
PI3K silencing showed a similar downregulated trend between PI3K/Akt/CncC and 
CarE18. Moreover, silencing PI3K rendered grubs more susceptible to EPN-Bt and 
accelerated symbiotic bacteria multiplication in grubs.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that PI3K/Akt/CncC pathway mediates the 
expression of CarE18 and participates in the defense response of H. parallela 
larvae against EPN-Bt infection. Our data provide valuable insights into the 
design of appropriate management strategies for this famous agricultural pest."
719,"The consequences of physical attractiveness (PA) are ubiquitous, however not 
often become a topic of discussion. The consequences, in general, are attributed 
to preference or discrimination without much deliberation. There is a very thin 
line between the two. The study makes an attempt to distinguish between 
preference and discrimination based on PA. In an organizational context, this 
distinction seems warranted since PA does impact work-related outcomes. The 
distinction was addressed by examining published studies between 1970 and 2021 
on PA in the management and economics field of research. The study highlights 
when and how preference turns into discrimination and furthers discusses the 
causes of such discrimination. The causes are equivalent to antecedents; the 
antecedent to being physically attractive is mostly genes. The antecedents to 
the discrimination are the attributions that we have associated with being 
physically attractive. The study highlights these attributions and the reasons 
for these attributions. To completely understand a phenomenon, it is essential 
to understand what causes it. Therefore, this study tries to understand what 
causes discrimination based on PA. The study has implications for diversity and 
inclusion literature and practice. It also adds to the literature on PA."
720,"Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) generally shows low or undetectable 
expression in most normal tissues but is highly expressed in fibroblasts in 
almost all carcinomas. FAP is one of the potential molecules to detect activated 
fibroblasts and has multiple roles in tumour progression. We generated 
transgenic mice that specifically expressed tdTomato along with FAP promoter 
activity. Coculturing a mouse gastric cancer cell line and FAP-tdTomato 
transgenic mouse-derived fibroblasts showed that tdTomato expression was 
elevated in the cocultured fibroblasts. Moreover, stomach wall transplanted 
tumours in mice also showed FAP-tdTomato expression in fibroblasts of the 
stomach and each metastatic legion. These results indicated that FAP-tdTomato 
expression in fibroblasts was elevated by stimulation through the interaction 
with cancer cells. Functionally, collagen production was increased in 
FAP/tdTomato-positive fibroblasts cocultured with mouse cancer cells. These 
FAP-tdTomato transgenic mice have the potential to be used to investigate 
real-time FAP dynamics and the importance of FAP expression in tumour 
development."
721,"Split-hand/foot malformation (SHFM) with long-bone deficiency (SHFLD) is a rare 
condition characterized by SHFM associated with long-bone malformation usually 
involving the tibia. It includes three different types; SHFLD1 (MIM % 119,100), 
SHFLD2 (MIM % 610,685) and SHFLD3 (MIM # 612576). The latter was shown to be the 
most commonly reported with a duplication in the 17p13.1p13.3 locus that was 
narrowed down to the BHLHA9 gene. Here, we report a consanguineous Lebanese 
family with three members presenting with limb abnormalities including tibial 
hemimelia. One of these patients presented with additional bowing fibula and 
another with bilateral split hand. CGH array analysis followed by RQ-PCR allowed 
us to detect the first homozygous duplication on the short arm of chromosome 
17p13.3 including the BHLHA9 gene and involved in SHFLD3. Interestingly, one 
patient with the homozygous duplicated region, carrying thus four BHLHA9 copies 
presented with long bone deficiency but no SHFM. The incomplete penetrance and 
the variable expressivity of the disease in this family as well as the presence 
of the BHLHA9 homozygous duplication rendered genetic counseling extremely 
challenging and preimplantation genetic diagnosis almost impossible."
722,"3D printing has recently emerged as an innovative fabrication method to 
construct critical-sized and patient-specific bone scaffolds. The ability to 
control the bulk geometry of scaffolds in both macro and micro-scales 
distinguishes this technology from other fabrication methods. In this study, 
bone tissue-specific scaffolds with different pore geometries were printed from 
polylactic acid (PLA) filaments at three given infill densities ranging from 20 
to 30%. A hybrid hydrogel made of synthetic biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) and 
collagen was applied to coat 3D printed well-structured triangular samples with 
30% infill density. The coating process changed the surface texture, increased 
the average strand diameter and average pore size, and decreased the open 
porosity of samples, all of which increased the mechanical strength of 
biomimetic-coated scaffolds. According to matrix mineralization staining and 
osteo-related gene expression, the coating of scaffolds significantly 
facilitates metabolic activity and osteogenic differentiation of dental 
pulp-derived mesenchymal stem cells (DPSCs). Taken together, these results 
indicated that the biomimetic coating is a highly promising approach that could 
be taken into consideration in the design of a porous scaffold for bone tissue 
engineering."
723,"AIM: To explore the effects of phase-transited lysozyme (PTL) coated dentine 
slices on cell adhesion, migration and odontogenic differentiation of human 
dental pulp cells (HDPCs).
METHODOLOGY: Cell growth and cell cycle analysis were conducted to verify the 
biocompatibility of PTL for HDPCs. Cell adhesion, cell morphology and 
proliferation were explored by DiI staining, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
and MTT assay. Cell migration was investigated by Transwell assay. The effects 
of PTL on the odontogenesis and mineralization of HDPCs were assessed by 
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot 
(WB). The mineralization of HDPCs was evaluated by Alizarin red staining. HDPCs 
were isolated from extracted third molars. The level of statistically 
significant difference was accepted at P<0.05.
RESULTS: PTL showed no negative effect on cell cycle of HDPCs and compared with 
the blank group, HDPCs labelled with DiI staining showed significantly more 
adhered cells at 48h (P<0.05), extending cell processes and more finger-like or 
reticular pseudopodia on PTL-coated dentine slices. The results of MTT and 
Transwell assay showed that PTL promoted the proliferation (P<0.05) and 
migration (P<0.01) of HDPCs respectively. Compared with the blank group, the 
gene expression of dentine sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), osteopontin (OPN) and 
bone sialoprotein (BSP) in HDPCs cultured on PTL was significantly upregulated 
on day 3 and 7 (P<0.05), while the protein expression of DSPP showed no 
significant change on both day 7 and day 14. Alizarin red staining showed that 
PTL promoted more mineralization nodules formation of HDPCs (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: PTL promoted the adhesion, proliferation and migration of HDPCs on 
dentine slices, and positively affected odontogenic differentiation and 
mineralization of HDPCs."
724,"Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder first 
described in 2018, mostly associated with de novo variants in the CHD3 gene that 
affects chromatin remodeling. This syndrome is characterized by developmental 
delay, speech delay, and intellectual disability, but only about 60 affected 
individuals have been reported to date. We report a de novo likely pathogenic 
CHD3 variant (c.5609G > A; p. (Arg1870Gln)) in a young female presenting with 
features of Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome including speech delay, autism 
spectrum disorder, learning difficulties, characteristic facial dysmorphisms, 
and a feature not previously described in this syndrome, idiopathic central 
precocious puberty. Her puberty was controlled with monthly injections of a GnRH 
analogue. Targeted exome sequencing was negative for genes known to be 
responsible for central precocious puberty. Our case raises the possibility that 
variants in CHD3 gene may also result in central precocious puberty. 
Strengthening this association could expand the phenotypic spectrum of the 
Snijders Blok-Campeau syndrome and should be included in multigene panels for 
precocious puberty."
725,"AIM: To compare the odontogenic differentiation potential of a composite 
scaffold (CSHA) comprising of nanohydroxyapatite (nHAp) and 
carboxymethyl-chitosan (CMC) with Biodentine on human dental pulp stem cells 
(hDPSCs).
METHODOLOGY: A CSHA scaffold was prepared through an ultrasonication route by 
adding nHAp and CMC (1:5 w/w) in water medium followed by freeze-drying. 
Physico-chemical characterization was achieved using scanning electron 
microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and 
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In-vitro bioactivity and pH assessments 
were done by soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF) for 28 days. The angiogenic 
and odontogenic differentiation abilities were assessed by expression of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Dentine sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) 
markers on cultured hDPSCs by flow-cytometry and RT-qPCR at 7,14 and 21 days. 
Cell viability/proliferation and biomineralization abilities of CSHA were 
compared with Biodentine by MTT assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, 
Alizarin Red Staining (ARS) and osteopontin (OPN) expression on hDPSCs following 
7 and 14 days. Data were statistically analyzed with Kruskal Wallis and Friedman 
tests as well as one way ANOVA followed by appropriate post hoc tests (p 
< 0.05).
RESULTS: Characterization experiments revealed a porous microstructure of CSHA 
with pore diameter ranging between 60-200 μm and 1.67 Ca/P molar ratio along 
with the characteristic functional groups of both HAp and CMC. CSHA displayed 
bioactivity in SBF by forming apatite-like crystals and maintained a consistent 
pH value of 7.70 during 28 days' in-vitro studies. CSHA significantly 
upregulated VEGF and DSPP levels on hDPSCs on day 21 compared with day 7 (p 
< 0.05). Further, CSHA supported cell viability/proliferation over 14 days like 
Biodentine with no statistical differences (p > 0.05). However, CSHA exhibited 
increased ALP and ARS activity with an intense OPN staining compared with 
Biodentine after 14 days (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The results highlighted the odontogenic differentiation and 
biomineralization abilities of CSHA on hDPSCs with significant VEGF and DSPP 
gene upregulations. Further, CSHA exhibited enhanced mineralization activity 
than Biodentine, as evidenced by increased ALP, ARS and OPN activity on day 14. 
The nHAp-CMC scaffold has the potential to act as an effective pulp capping 
agent, however, this needs to be further validated through in-vivo animal 
studies."
726,"BACKGROUND: The main molecular mechanism underlying acute suppression of iodine 
organification in normal thyroids after an excessive iodine load, i.e., the 
Wolff-Chaikoff effect, is assumed to be suppression of iodine oxidation and 
iodothyronine synthesis. However, the mechanism underlying chronic anti-thyroid 
action of inorganic iodine in Graves' disease is not fully understood. Using a 
mouse model of Graves' hyperthyroidism, we examined changes in iodothyronine 
content and gene expression profiles in the thyroid glands after inorganic 
iodine loading.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Graves' hyperthyroidism was induced and maintained in 
BALB/c mice by repeated immunizations of recombinant adenovirus expressing the 
human TSH receptor A-subunit. Hyperthyroid mice were left untreated (GD-C; n=8) 
or treated with inorganic iodine for 12 weeks (GD-NaI; n=8). We used unimmunized 
BALB/c mice as a control group (n=10). In each mouse, serum T4 levels were 
measured with ELISA at 4-week intervals. The intrathyroidal iodothyronine 
content and gene expression levels were respectively evaluated by mass 
spectrometry and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) at the end of the experimental period.
RESULTS: Serum T4 levels in the GD-C group remained higher than the control 
group, whereas those in the GD-NaI group declined to normal levels during the 
experimental period. Intrathyroidal T3, reverse (r) T3 and T4 contents in the 
GD-C group were higher than the control group, and rT3 and T4 were further 
increased in the GD-NaI group. The observed alterations in iodothyronine levels 
in the thyroid and sera may be explained by altered expression levels of genes 
for iodothyronine biosynthetic molecules, their transporter and deiodinases.
CONCLUSION: In this mouse model of hyperthyroidism, higher intrathyroidal 
accumulation of T4 and reduced gene expression data of iodothyronine 
transporters in the GD-NaI group suggest that chronic anti-thyroid action of 
iodine in Graves' disease involves suppression of hormone secretion."
727,"Here, we demonstrate improvements to our bioinformatic pipeline, PING, which 
provides high-resolution genotyping of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 
(KIR) sequencing data, that expand the method to provide KIR interpretation from 
whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. We evaluated performance using synthetic 
sequence datasets and real-world data from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP). PING 
demonstrated high exonic genotyping performance on the synthetic sequence 
dataset meant to approximate real-world data at 95% accuracy (N=1366). This 
result was mirrored in the analysis of 1KGP European data (N=215) with most 
genes showing near or below 5% frequency of unresolved exonic genotypes, which 
is an important indicator for genotyping errors in real-world data. An analysis 
into the distributions of genotyping errors for the synthetic sequence datasets 
gave insights into how to further improve genotype accuracy. Similarly, an 
analysis into ambiguous exonic genotype frequencies for the 1KGP European data, 
which showed high rates of unresolved genotypes, highlighted that an effective 
phasing method will be an impactful future additional to the PING workflow. 
Together, these results demonstrate that PING can effectively provide 
high-resolution KIR genotyping on WGS data. This article is protected by

728,"INTRODUCTION: Patients lacking functional Monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), 
a highly specific thyroid hormone (TH) transporter, present severe psychomotor 
disabilities. MCT8 deficiency leads to peripheral hyperthyroidism and brain 
hypothyroidism, the latter due to impaired transport of TH across brain 
barriers. Available treatments for patients are limited and aim to overcome the 
limited TH transport across brain barriers. The use of TH analogues such as 
3,3',5-triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) that do not require MCT8 to cross the 
cellular membranes is considered a potential therapy for MCT8 deficiency. 
Previous studies have shown that systemic administration of TRIAC at therapeutic 
doses does not increase TRIAC content in the brain, while 
intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of therapeutic doses of TRIAC 
increases TRIAC content in the brain but does not mediate thyromimetic effects. 
In view of this, we hypothesise that ICV administration of high doses of TRIAC 
can mediate thyromimetic effects in the brain without worsening the brain 
hypothyroidism or peripheral hyperthyroidism of patients.
METHODS: 400 ng/g of body weight per day of TRIAC were administered ICV to a 
mouse model of MCT8 deficiency: Mct8-/y and deiodinase 2 (Dio2)-/ - double 
knockout mice. The effects of this treatment on TH and TRIAC levels/content in 
blood and tissues were determined by radioimmunoassay and effects on 
TH-regulated genes were assessed by RT-qPCR in peripheral and central tissues.
RESULTS: ICV administration of high doses of TRIAC ameliorated the peripheral 
hyperthyroidism. In the brain, this treatment did not further aggravate brain 
hypothyroidism and increased TRIAC content in several brain regions; however, 
only moderate thyromimetic activity was observed in restricted brain areas.
CONCLUSION: Administration of high doses of TRIAC by ICV delivery at juvenile 
stages in a mouse model of MCT8 deficiency, is effective in normalising 
peripheral hyperthyroidism, but exerts minimal thyromimetic activity in the 
brain."
729,"Stem cell niches have been thoroughly investigated in tissue with high 
regenerative capacity but not in tissues where cell turnover is slow, such as 
the human heart. The left AtrioVentricular junction (AVj), the base of the 
mitral valve, has previously been proposed as a niche region for cardiac 
progenitors in the adult human heart. In the present study, we explore the right 
side of the human heart; the base of the tricuspid valve, to investigate the 
potential of this region as a progenitor niche. Paired biopsies from explanted 
human hearts were collected from multi organ donors (N=12). The lateral side of 
the AVj, right atria (RA) and right ventricle (RV) were compared for the 
expression of stem cell niche-related biomarkers using RNA sequencing. Gene 
expression data indicated upregulation of genes related to embryonic development 
and extracellular matrix composition in the proposed niche region, i.e. the AVj. 
In addition, immunohistochemistry showed high expression of the fetal cardiac 
markers MDR1, SSEA4, and WT1 within the same region. Nuclear expression of 
HIF1-α was detected suggesting hypoxia. Rare cells were found with the 
co-staining of the proliferation marker PCNA and Ki67 with cardiomyocyte nuclei 
marker PCM1 and cardiac TroponinT (cTnT), indicating proliferation of small 
cardiomyocytes. WT1+/cTnT+ and SSEA4+/cTnT+ cells were also found, suggesting 
cardiomyocyte specific progenitors. The expression of the stem cell markers 
gradually decreased with distance from the tricuspid valve. No expression of 
these markers was observed in the RV tissue. In summary, the base of the 
tricuspid valve is an extracellular matrix rich region containing cells with 
expression of several stem cell niche-associated markers. Co-expression of stem 
cell markers with cTnT indicates cardiomyocyte specific progenitors. We 
previously reported similar data from the base of the mitral valve and thus 
propose that human adult cardiomyocyte progenitors reside around both 
atrioventricular valves."
730,"An important quality attribute of a recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (rAAV) as 
a therapeutic vector is its infectivity. Current assays to quantify infectious 
rAAV rely on coinfection with a helper virus such as adenovirus, which requires 
helper virus preparation and introduces additional variability. Here we describe 
a stable assay cell line that was generated by integrating the coding sequences 
for AAV Rep68 and adenovirus E4orf6 and DNA Binding Protein (DBP) under the 
control of inducible promoters. The Rep68 protein expression was further 
modulated by a ligand-responsive destabilization domain. In several benchmarks, 
the cell line gave comparable titers to those obtained using a classical 
adenovirus coinfection method. The cell line was also used to titer vectors of 
multiple AAV serotypes. This cell line has the potential to serve as an 
effective and robust tool for product quality evaluation."
731,"The phenotypic repercussion of ZDHHC15 haploinsufficiency is not well-known. 
This gene was initially suggested as a candidate for X-linked mental 
retardation, but such an association was later questioned. We studied a 
multiplex family with three members with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by array 
CGH, karyotype, exome sequencing and X-chromosome inactivation patterns. Medical 
history interviews, cognitive and physical examinations, and sensory profiling 
were also assessed. The three family members with ASD (with normal cognitive 
abilities and an abnormal sensory profile) were the only carriers of a 1.7 Mb 
deletion in the long arm of chromosome X, involving: ZDHHC15, MAGEE2, PBDC1, 
MAGEE1, MIR384 and MIR325. The normal chromosome X was preferentially 
inactivated in female carriers, and the whole exome sequencing of an affected 
family member did not reveal any additional genetic variant that could explain 
the phenotype. Thus, in the present family, ASD segregates with a deletion on 
chromosome X that includes ZDHHC15. Considering our results together with gene 
data (regarding function, expression, conservation and animal/cellular models), 
ZDHHC15 is a candidate gene for ASD. Emerging evidence also suggests that this 
gene could be associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders, with 
incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity."
732,"Base editing enables precise gene editing without requiring donor DNA or 
double-stranded breaks. To facilitate base editing tools, a uracil DNA 
glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) was fused to cytidine deaminase-Cas nickase to 
inhibit uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG). Herein, we revealed that the bacteriophage 
PBS2-derived UGI of the cytosine base editor (CBE) could not inhibit archaic 
Type IV UDG in oligoploid cyanobacteria. To overcome the limitation of the CBE, 
dCas12a-assisted gene repression of the udg allowed base editing at the desired 
targets with up to 100% mutation frequencies, and yielded correct phenotypes of 
desired mutants in cyanobacteria. Compared with the original CBE (BE3), base 
editing was analyzed within a broader C4 to C16 window with a strong TC-motif 
preference. Using multiplexed CyanoCBE, while udg was repressed, simultaneous 
base editing at two different sites was achieved with lower mutation frequencies 
than single CBE. Our discovery of a Type IV UDG that is not inhibited by the UGI 
of the CBE in cyanobacteria and the development of dCas12a-mediated base editing 
should facilitate the application of base editing not only in cyanobacteria, but 
also in archaea and green algae that possess Type IV UDGs."
733,"Carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.) is one of the most famous and ethylene 
sensitive cut flowers worldwide, but how ethylene interacts with other plant 
hormones and factors to regulate petal senescence in carnation is largely 
unknown. Here we found that a WRKY family transcription factor, DcWRKY33, was 
significantly up-regulated by ethylene treatment. Silencing and overexpression 
of DcWRKY33 could delay and accelerate the senescence of carnation petal 
respectively. Meanwhile, ABA and H2 O2 treatments could also accelerate the 
senescence of carnation petal by inducing the expression of DcWRKY33. Further, 
DcWRKY33 can directly bind to the promoters of ethylene biosynthesis genes 
(DcACS1 and DcACO1), ABA biosynthesis genes (DcNCED2 and DcNCED5) and ROS 
generating gene (DcRBOHB) to activate their expression. Lastly, relationships 
are existed between ethylene, ABA and ROS. This study elucidated that DcWRKY33 
promotes petal senescence by activating genes involved in the biosynthesis of 
ethylene, ABA and accumulation of ROS in carnation, which give us new strategy 
to prolong the vase life of cut carnation."
734,"• The establishment of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) between plants and 
Glomeromycotina fungi is preceded by the exchange of chemical signals: fungal 
released Myc-factors, including chitoligosaccharides (CO) and 
lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCO), activate plant symbiotic responses, while root 
exuded strigolactones stimulate hyphal branching and boost CO release. 
Furthermore, fungal signaling reinforcement through CO application was shown to 
promote AM development in Medicago truncatula, but the cellular and molecular 
bases of this effect remained unclear. • Here we focused on long-term M. 
truncatula responses to CO treatment, demonstrating its impact on the 
transcriptome of both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roots over several weeks 
and providing an insight into the mechanistic bases of the CO-dependent 
promotion of AM colonization. • CO treatment caused the long-lasting regulation 
of strigolactone biosynthesis and fungal accommodation related genes. This was 
mirrored by an increase in root didehydro-orobanchol content, and the promotion 
of accommodation responses to AM fungi in root epidermal cells. Lastly, an 
advanced down-regulation of AM symbiosis marker genes was observed at the latest 
time point in CO-treated plants, in line with an increased number of senescent 
arbuscules. • Overall, CO treatment triggered molecular, metabolic and cellular 
responses underpinning a protracted acceleration of AM development."
735,"Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1) is a key regulator of plant architecture. 
However, knowledge of downstream genes applicable for improving rice plant 
architecture is very limited. We identified the plant architecture regulatory 
gene NAL11 (NARROW LEAF 11), which encodes a heat-shock protein (HSP) containing 
a DnaJ domain. A promising rare allele of NAL11 (NAL11-923del-1552 ) positively 
selected in Aus cultivars was identified; this allele exhibited increased 
expression and generated relatively few tillers, thick stems and large panicles, 
components of the ideal plant architecture (IPA). NAL11 is involved in 
regulating the cell cycle and cell proliferation. NAL11 loss-of-function mutants 
present impaired chloroplast development and gibberellin (GA) defects. 
Biochemical analyses show that IPA1 directly binds to elements in the missing 
fragment of the NAL11-923del-1552 promoter and negatively regulates NAL11 
expression. Genetic analyses support the hypothesis that NAL11 acts downstream 
of IPA1 to regulate IPA by modulating GA homeostasis, and NAL11 may be an 
essential complement for IPA1. Our work revealed that avoidance of the 
inhibition of NAL11-923del-1552 caused by IPA1 represents a positive strategy 
for rescuing GA defects accompanied by the upregulation of IPA1 in breeding 
high-yield rice."
736,"As the seed precursor, the ovule produces the female gametophyte (or embryo 
sac), and the subsequent double fertilization occurs in it. The integuments 
emerge sequentially from the integument primordia at the early stages of ovule 
development, and finally enwrap the embryo sac gradually during gametogenesis, 
protecting and nursing the embryo sac. However, the mechanisms regulating 
integument development are still obscure. In this study, we show that SOMATIC 
EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASES (SERKs) play essential roles during 
integument development in Arabidopsis thaliana. The serk1/2/3 triple mutant 
shows arrested integuments and abnormal embryo sacs, similar defects also found 
in the triple loss-of-function mutants of ERECTA family (ERf) genes. Ovules of 
serk1/2/3 er erl1/2 show defects similar to er erl1/2 and serk1/2/3. Results of 
yeast two-hybrid analyses, bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses, 
and co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SERKs interact with ERf, 
which depends on EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE (EPFL) family small peptides. 
The sextuple mutant epfl1/2/3/4/5/6 shows integument defects similar to both of 
er erl1/2 and serk1/2/3. Our results demonstrate that ERf-SERK-mediated EPFL 
signaling orchestrates the development of the female gametophyte and the 
surrounding sporophytic integuments."
737,"There is an urgent need to understand the coupled relationship between 
belowground microbes and aboveground plants in response to temperature under 
climate change. The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) provides a way to predict 
the metabolic rate and species diversity, but the spatial scale dependence and 
connections between plants and microorganisms are still unclear. Here, we used 
two independent datasets to address this question. One is from comprehensive 
sampling of paddy fields targeting bacteria and microbial functional genes, and 
the other is a global metadata of spatial turnover for microorganisms (bacteria, 
fungi, and archaea, n = 139) and plants (n = 206). Results showed that spatial 
turnover of bacterial communities and microbial functional genes increased with 
temperature and fitted MTE. Through meta-analysis, the temperature-dependent 
spatial scale pattern was further extended to the global scale, with the spatial 
turnover of microorganisms and plants being consistent with MTE. Belowground 
microorganisms and aboveground plants were closely linked with each other even 
when controlling for temperature, suggesting that factors other than shared 
relationships with temperature also contribute to their linkages. These results 
implied a broad application of MTE in biology and have important implications 
for predicting the ecological consequences of future climate warming."
738,"BACKGROUND: KBG syndrome is a rare genetic disorder involving macrodontia of the 
upper central incisors, craniofacial, skeletal, and neurologic symptoms, caused 
either by a heterozygous variant in ANKRD11 or deletion of 16q24.3, including 
ANKRD11. Diagnostic criteria were proposed in 2007 based on 50 cases, but KBG 
syndrome remains underdiagnosed.
METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and array comparative genomic 
hybridization (array CGH) were conducted for genetic analysis and patient 
phenotypes were characterized based on medical records.
RESULTS: Eight patients from seven unrelated families were confirmed with KBG 
syndrome. All patients (8/8, 100%) had some degree of craniofacial dysmorphism 
and developmental delay or intellectual disabilities. Triangular face, 
synophrys, anteverted nostril, prominent ears, long philtrum, and tented upper 
lip, which are typical facial dysmorphism findings in patients with KBG 
syndrome, were uniformly identified in the eight patients participating in this 
study, with co-occurrence rates of 4/8 (50%), 4/8 (50%), 4/8 (50%), 4/8 (50%), 
5/8 (62.5%), and 5/8 (62.5%), respectively. Various clinical manifestations not 
included in the diagnostic criteria were observed. Six patients had point 
mutations in ANKRD11, one had an exonic deletion of ANKRD11, and one had a 
16q24.3 microdeletion. According to the ACMG guidelines, all mutations were 
classified as pathogenic. The c.2454dup (p.Asn819fs*1) mutation in Pt 4 was 
reported previously. The remaining variants (c.397 + 1G>A, c.226 + 1G>A, 
c.2647del (p.Glu883Argfs*94), and c.4093C>T (p.Arg1365Ter)) were novel.
CONCLUSION: The clinical and molecular features of eight patients from seven 
unrelated Korean families with KBG syndrome described here will assist 
physicians in understanding this rare genetic condition."
739,"This review aimed to identify preclinical and clinical studies examining the 
effects of rosmarinic acid (RA), carnosic acid (CaA), rosmanol (RO), carnosol 
(CA), and ursolic acid (UA) against allergic and immunologic disorders. Various 
online databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, 
Cochrane trials, and Scopus, were searched from inception until October 2022. 
Due to the suppression of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, the main factor 
in allergic asthma, RA may be a promising candidate for the treatment of asthma. 
The other ingredients comprising CA and UA reduce the expression of interleukin 
(IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and improve airway inflammation. Rosemary's anti-cancer 
effect is mediated by several mechanisms, including DNA fragmentation, apoptosis 
induction, inhibition of astrocyte-upregulated gene-1 expression, and 
obstruction of cell cycle progression in the G1 phase. The compounds, 
essentially found in Rosemary essential oil, prevent smooth muscle contraction 
through its calcium antagonistic effects, inhibiting acetylcholine (ACH), 
histamine, and norepinephrine stimulation. Additionally, CA exhibits a 
substantially greater interaction with the nicotinic ACH receptor than a family 
of medications that relax the smooth muscles, making it a potent antispasmodic 
treatment. The components have demonstrated therapeutic effects on the immune, 
allergy, and respiratory disorders."
740,"Plants have sophisticated mechanisms of gene expressions to control the 
senescence in response to environmental stress or aging. ORE1 (Arabidopsis 
thaliana NAC092) is a master regulator of senescence that belongs to the 
plant-specific NAC transcription factor protein family. ORE1 has been reported 
to bind to multiple DNA targets to orchestrate leaf senescence, yet the 
mechanistic basis for recognizing the cognate gene sequence remains unclear. 
Here, we report the crystal structure of the ORE1-NAC domain alone and its 
DNA-binding form. The structure of DNA-bound ORE1-NAC revealed the molecular 
basis for nucleobase recognition as well as phosphate backbone interactions. We 
also show that the local versatility in the DNA binding site, in combination 
with the domain flexibility of the ORE-NAC homodimer, is crucial for maintaining 
binding to intrinsically flexible DNA. Our results provide a platform for 
understanding other plant-specific NAC protein-DNA interactions, as well as 
insight into the structural basis of NAC regulators for plants of agronomical 
and scientific importance."
741,"BACKGROUND: There is a considerable need to incorporate biomarkers of resistance 
to new antiandrogen agents in the management of castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (CRPC).
METHODS: We conducted a phase II trial of enzalutamide in first-line chemo-naïve 
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC and analyzed the prognostic value of 
TMPRSS2-ERG and other biomarkers, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), 
androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) in CTCs and plasma Androgen Receptor 
copy number gain (AR-gain). These biomarkers were correlated with treatment 
response and survival outcomes and developed a clinical-molecular prognostic 
model using penalized cox-proportional hazard model. This model was validated in 
an independent cohort.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients were included. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene was 
detected in 32 patients with no differences observed in efficacy outcomes. CTC 
detection was associated with worse outcome and AR-V7 in CTCs was associated 
with increased rate of progression as best response. Plasma AR gain was strongly 
associated with an adverse outcome, with worse median prostate specific antigen 
(PSA)-PFS (4.2 vs. 14.7 m; p < 0.0001), rad-PFS (4.5 vs. 27.6 m; p < 0.0001), 
and OS (12.7 vs. 38.1 m; p < 0.0001). The clinical prognostic model developed in 
PREVAIL was validated (C-Index 0.70) and the addition of plasma AR (C-Index 
0.79; p < 0.001) increased its prognostic ability. We generated a parsimonious 
model including alkaline phosphatase (ALP); PSA and AR gain (C-index 0.78) that 
was validated in an independent cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: TMPRSS2-ERG detection did not correlate with differential activity 
of enzalutamide in first-line mCRPC. However, we observed that CTCs and plasma 
AR gain were the most relevant biomarkers."
742,"Myocardial infarctions affect approximately 735,000 people annually in the 
United States and have a substantial impact on quality of life. Neonates have an 
enhanced capability of repairing cardiovascular damage, while adults do not. The 
mechanistic basis for this age-dependent difference in regenerative capacity 
remains unknown. Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a 
significant role in regulating the regenerative ability of cardiovascular cells. 
This report defines the alterations in miRNA expression within the 
cardiovascular repair zone of infarcted sheep hearts following intracardiac 
injection of neonatal islet-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cells. Sheep were 
infarcted via left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. After 3 to 4 
weeks of infarction, sheep neonatal islet-1+ cardiovascular progenitor cells 
were injected into the infarcted area for repair. Cell-treated sheep were 
euthanized 2 months following cell injection, and their hearts were harvested 
for the analysis of miRNA and gene expression within the cardiovascular repair 
zone. Ten miRNAs were differentially regulated in vivo, including miR-99, 
miR-100, miR-302a, miR-208a, miR-665, miR-1, miR-499a, miR-34a, miR-133a, and 
miR-199a. These miRNAs promote stemness, cell division, and survival. Several 
signaling pathways are regulated by these miRNAs, including Hippo, Wnt, and 
Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene B (ERBB). Transcripts encoding Wnt, ERBB, 
and Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) were elevated in vivo in the infarct repair zone. Wnt5a 
signaling and ERBB/NRG1 transcripts contribute to activation of Yes-Associated 
Protein 1. MiRNAs that impact proliferation, cell survival, and signaling 
pathways that promote regeneration were induced during cardiovascular repair in 
the sheep model. This information can be used to design new approaches for the 
optimization of miRNA-based treatments for the heart."
743,"Alginate hydrogel is an attractive biomaterial for cell microencapsulation. The 
microarchitecture of hydrogels can regulate cellular functions. This study aims 
to investigate the applicability of sodium citrate buffer (SCB) as a culture 
medium supplement for modulating the microstructure of alginate microbeads to 
provide a favorable microenvironment for chondrogenic induction. The 
chondrocyte-laden microbeads, with and without TGF-β3 incorporation, were 
produced through an encapsulator. The obtained small-sized microbeads (~300 μm) 
were exposed to a treatment medium containing SCB, composed of varied 
concentrations of sodium citrate (1.10 - 1.57 mM), sodium chloride (3.00 - 
4.29 mM), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (0.60 - 0.86 mM) to partially 
degrade their crosslinked structure for three days, followed by culture in a 
normal medium until Day 21. SEM micrographs demonstrated a loose hydrogel 
network with an enhanced pore size in the SCB-treated microbeads. Increasing the 
concentration of SCB in the treatment medium reduced the calcium content of the 
microbeads via a Na+ /Ca2+ exchange process and improved the water absorption of 
the microbeads, resulting in a higher swelling ratio. All the tested SCB 
concentrations were non-cytotoxic. Increases in aggrecan and type II collagen 
gene expression and their corresponding extracellular matrix accumulation, 
glycosaminoglycans, and type II collagen were vividly detected in the 
TGF-β3-containing microbeads with increasing SCB concentrations in the treatment 
medium. Our findings highlighted that the combination of SCB treatment and 
TGF-β3 incorporation in the chondrocyte-laden microbeads is a promising strategy 
for enhancing cartilage regeneration, which may contribute to a versatile 
application in cell delivery and tissue engineering."
744,"SCOPE: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) provide a useful and minimally 
invasive source of biomarkers. Here we aimed to identify PBMC transcriptomic 
biomarkers predictive of metabolic impairment related to increased adiposity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the global PBMC transcriptome in metabolically 
healthy (normoglycemic) volunteers with overweight-obesity (OW-OB, n = 12), and 
in subjects with metabolically-obese normal-weight (MONW, n = 5) phenotype, in 
comparison to normal weight (NW, n = 12) controls. We identified 1,072 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in OW-OB versus NW and 992 in MONW versus 
NW. Hierarchical clustering of the top 100 DEGs clearly distinguished OW-OB and 
MONW from NW. Remarkably, the OW-OB and MONW phenotypes shared 257 DEGs 
regulated in the same direction. The top up-regulated gene CXCL8, coding for 
interleukin 8, with a role in obesity-related pathologies, was of special 
interest as a potential marker for predicting increased metabolic risk. CXCL8 
expression was increased mainly in the MONW group and correlated directly with 
C-reactive protein levels.
CONCLUSIONS: PBMC gene expression analysis of CXCL8 or a pool of DEGs might be 
used to identify early metabolic risk in an apparently healthy population 
regardless of their BMI, i.e., subjects with OW-OB or MONW phenotype and to 
apply adequate and personalized nutritional preventive strategies. This article

745,"Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential cofactor involved in a range of metabolic 
pathways including the activation of long-chain fatty acids for catabolism. 
Cells synthesize CoA de novo from vitamin B5 (pantothenate) via a pathway 
strongly conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In humans, it involves 
five enzymatic steps catalyzed by four enzymes: pantothenate kinase (PANK 
[isoforms 1-4]), 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase (PPCS), 
phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase (PPCDC), and CoA synthase (COASY). To 
date, inborn errors of metabolism associated with all of these genes, except 
PPCDC, have been described, two related to neurodegeneration with brain iron 
accumulation (NBIA), and one associated with a cardiac phenotype. This paper 
reports another defect in this pathway (detected in two sisters), associated 
with a fatal cardiac phenotype, caused by biallelic variants (p.Thr53Pro and 
p.Ala95Val) of PPCDC. PPCDC enzyme (EC 4.1.1.36) catalyzes the decarboxylation 
of 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine to 4'-phosphopantetheine in CoA biosynthesis. 
The variants p.Thr53Pro and p.Ala95Val affect residues highly conserved across 
different species; p.Thr53Pro is involved in the binding of flavin 
mononucleotide, and p.Ala95Val is likely a destabilizing mutation. 
Patient-derived fibroblasts showed an absence of PPCDC protein, and nearly 50% 
reductions in CoA levels. The cells showed clear energy deficiency problems, 
with defects in mitochondrial respiration, , and mostly glycolytic ATP 
synthesis. Functional studies performed in yeast suggest these mutations to be 
functionally relevant. In summary, this work describes a new, ultra-rare, severe 
inborn error of metabolism due to pathogenic variants of PPCDC."
746,"Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and preventing susceptible 
patients from lethal infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly 
desirable but have proven to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a hybrid 
immunoactive nanosurface is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral 
immunity. A combination of checkpoint blocking antibody and virus-specific 
antigen is covalently conjugated to polydopamine nanoparticles, which can be 
anchored onto bacterial surface, by a one-step in-situ polymerization of 
dopamine under a cell-friendly condition. By virtue of the ability to colonize 
and penetrate deep tumor tissue, dressed bacteria enable sustained release and 
expanded exposure of carried immunoactivators to stimulate immune cells. In 
addition to a carrier role, bacteria are able to further provoke innate immunity 
due to native immunogenicity of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns. 
Immunization with dressed bacteria promote the maturation and activation of 
antigen-presenting cells, which induces robust humoral and cellular immune 
responses in tumor-bearing mice. As evidenced by efficient production of viral 
antigen-specific immunoglobulin G antibody in serum and significantly suppressed 
tumor growth in different models, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive 
nanosurface paves an avenue to prepare next-generation therapeutics for 
synergistic treatment and prevention. This article is protected by copyright.

747,"Atrazine (ATZ) is the second most commonly used herbicide worldwide, resulting 
in the pollution of water bodies and affecting the economic benefits of 
aquaculture. ATZ is known to cause liver damage in the common carp, Cyprinus 
carpio L., one of the most widely cultivated fish in China, but the underlying 
mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, juvenile common carp Cyprinus 
carpio L. were exposed to three different environmental levels (0.4, 0.8, and 
1.2 μg/L) of ATZ for 12 weeks and changes in the liver transcriptomes between 
the high-dose group and the control group were analyzed. The data showed that 
different levels of ATZ exposure caused hepatotoxicity in juvenile carp, shown 
by biochemical parameters and histopathological changes. Comparative 
transcriptomics showed that high-dose ATZ exposure led to alterations in the 
expression of various lipid metabolism-related gene changes, including genes 
associated with metabolic pathways, fatty acid metabolism, and fatty acid 
elongation. Furthermore, a connection network analysis of the top 100 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed a variety of associations between 
high-dose ATZ-induced liver damage and the principal DEGs, indicating the 
complexity of hepatotoxicity induced by ATZ. In conclusion, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying ATZ-triggered hepatotoxicity in juvenile carp are 
primarily related to impaired lipid metabolism."
748,"Tumor therapeutic resistances are frequently linked to the recurrence and poor 
prognosis of cancers and have been a key bottleneck in clinical tumor treatment. 
Mucin1 (MUC1), a heterodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein, exhibits abnormally 
overexpression in a variety of human tumors and has been confirmed to be related 
to the formation of therapeutic resistance. In this review, the multifaceted 
roles of MUC1 in tumor therapy resistance are summarized from aspects of 
pan-cancer principles shared among therapies and individual mechanisms dependent 
on different therapies. Concretely, the common mechanisms of therapy resistance 
across cancers include interfering with gene expression, promoting genome 
instability, modifying tumor microenvironment, enhancing cancer heterogeneity 
and stemness, and activating evasion and metastasis. Moreover, the individual 
mechanisms of therapy resistance in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and biotherapy 
are introduced. Last but not least, MUC1-involved therapy resistance in 
different types of cancers and MUC1-related clinical trials are summarized."
749,"BACKGROUND: Introduction of the classification of brain tumours based on DNA 
methylation profile has significantly changed the diagnostic approach. Due to 
the paucity of data on the molecular profiling of meningiomas and their clinical 
implications, no effective therapies and new treatments have been implemented.
METHODS: DNA methylation profiling, copy number analysis, targeted sequencing 
and H3K27me3 expression was performed on 35 meningiomas and 5 controls.
RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (UHC) analysis revealed four 
distinct molecular subgroups: Malignant; Intermediate; Benign A, and Benign B. 
Molecular heterogeneity was observed within the same grade as the Intermediate, 
Benign A, and Benign B subgroups were composed of WHO grade 1 as well as grade 2 
cases. There was association of mutations with distinct methylation subgroups 
(NF2, AKT1, SMO, TRAF7 and pTERT). Loss of chromosome 22q was observed across 
all subgroups. 1p/14q co-deletion was seen in 50% of malignant and intermediate 
while CDKN2A loss was predominantly observed in malignant subgroup (50%). 
Majority of malignant (75%) and a small proportion of other subgroups 
(Intermediate: 25%, Benign A: 38.5%, and Benign B: 20%) harboured H3K27me3 loss. 
38,734 genes were dysregulated amongst the four subgroups. DKFZ classified 71% 
cases with acceptable score. On survival analysis, methylation profiling had 
significant impact on progression-free-survival in WHO grade1 and 2 meningiomas 
(p = 0.0051).
CONCLUSION: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling highlights clinically distinct 
molecular subgroups and heterogeneity within the same grade of meningiomas. 
Molecular profiling can usher in a paradigm shift in meningioma classification, 
prognostic prediction, and treatment strategy."
750,"BACKGROUND: In-vivo maternal haploids serve as the basis of doubled haploid (DH) 
breeding in maize. R1-navajo (R1-nj) gene governing anthocyanin colouration in 
the endosperm and embryo is widely used to identify haploid seeds. However, the 
expression of R1-nj depends on genetic-background of source-germplasm used for 
deriving DH-lines. Further, presence of C1-Inhibitor (C1-I) gene suppresses the 
expression of R1-nj, thus makes the selection of haploids difficult.
METHODS: In the present study, 178 subtropically-adapted maize inbreds were 
crossed with two R1-nj donors 'that do not have haploid induction genes'. Of 
these, 76.4% inbreds developed purple colour in endosperm, while 23.6% did not 
show any colouration. In case of scutellum, 62.9% inbreds possessed colour and 
37.1% were colourless. The anthocyanin intensity varied greatly, with 19.66% and 
42.98% inbreds displayed the least intensity, while 16.85% and 0.84% inbreds 
showed the highest intensity in endosperm and scutellum, respectively. Two C1-I 
specific breeder-friendly markers (MGU-CI-InDel8 and MGU-C1-SNP1) covering (i) 8 
bp InDel and (ii) A to G SNP, respectively, were developed. MGU-CI-InDel8 and 
MGU-C1-SNP1 markers predicted presence of C1-I allele with 92.9% and 84.7% 
effectiveness, respectively. However, when both markers were considered 
together, they provided 100% effectiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: These markers of C1-I gene would help in saving valuable resources 
and time during haploid induction in maize. The information generated here 
assume great significance in DH breeding of maize."
751,"Glomerular diseases afflict millions of people and impose an enormous burden on 
public healthcare costs worldwide. Identification of potential therapeutic 
targets for preventing glomerular diseases is of considerable clinical 
importance. CHILKBP is a focal adhesion protein and modulates a wide array of 
biological functions. However, little is known about the role of CHILKBP in 
glomerular diseases. To investigate the function of CHILKBP in maintaining the 
structure and function of podocytes in a physiologic setting, a mouse model 
(CHILKBP cKO) was generated in which CHILKBP gene was conditionally deleted in 
podocytes using the Cre-LoxP system. Ablation of CHILKBP in podocytes resulted 
in massive proteinuria and kidney failure in mice. Histologically, typical 
podocyte injury including podocyte loss, foot process effacement, and 
glomerulosclerosis was observed in CHILKBP cKO mice. Mechanistically, we 
identified ZO-1 as a key junctional protein that interacted with CHILKBP. Loss 
of CHILKBP in podocytes exhibited a significant reduction of ZO-1 expression, 
leading to abnormal actin organization, aberrant slit diaphragm protein 
expression and compromised podocyte filtration capacity. Restoration of CHILKBP 
or ZO-1 in CHILKBP-deficient podocytes effectively alleviated podocyte injury 
induced by the loss of CHILKBP in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we showed the 
glomerular expression of CHILKBP and ZO-1 was decreased in patients with 
proteinuric kidney diseases. Our findings reveal a novel signaling pathway 
consisting of CHILKBP and ZO-1 that plays an essential role in maintaining 
podocyte homeostasis and suggest novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate 
glomerular diseases."
752,"Plants biosynthesize a broad range of natural products through specialized and 
species-specific metabolic pathways that are fuelled by core metabolism, 
together forming a metabolic network. Specialized metabolites have important 
roles in development and adaptation to external cues, and they also have 
invaluable pharmacological properties. A growing body of evidence has 
highlighted the impact of translational, transcriptional, epigenetic and 
chromatin-based regulation and evolution of specialized metabolism genes and 
metabolic networks. Here we review the forefront of this research field and 
extrapolate to medicinal plants that synthetize rare molecules. We also discuss 
how this new knowledge could help in improving strategies to produce useful 
plant-derived pharmaceuticals."
753,"In this study, we explored the pyroptosis-related biomarkers and signatures of 
colorectal cancer (CRC). Gene expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-COADREAD and were 
analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DEGs in 
CRC‒pyroptosis-related genes (CRC‒PRGs) were obtained by intersecting DEGs 
associated with CRC and PRGs. The CRC‒PRGs were verified; functional enrichment 
analysis was performed with Gene Ontology (GO) followed by cluster analysis. Cox 
analyses and LASSO regression were used in TCGA dataset to construct a 
prognostic model for patients with CRC. A prognostic risk assessment model was 
constructed and efficacy was evaluated. Decision curve analysis was utilized to 
assess the role of the Lasso-Cox regression prognostic model for clinical 
utility at 1, 3, and 5 years. Twelve CRC‒PRGs were identified as prognostic 
pyroptosis-related DEGs. CXCL8, IL13RA2, MELK, and POP1 were selected as 
prognostic genes to construct features with a good prognostic performance in GEO 
and TCGA. Functional enrichment indicated that the 4-gene signature might be 
involved in CRC tumorigenesis and development through various pathways by 
playing a prognostic role in CRC. Furthermore, the results of the immune 
landscape analysis showed that the expression of CXCL8 and IL13RA2 in 
TCGA-COADREAD dataset was positively correlated with significant differential 
enrichment of most immune cells. A novel prognostic model consisting of four key 
genes, CXCL8, IL13RA2, MELK, and POP1, can accurately predict the survival of 
patients with CRC. This finding may provide a new perspective for the treatment 
of pyroptosis-related CRC."
754,"A polyphasic approach was used to determine the taxonomic position of a marine 
actinomycete, designated isolate CWH03T, which we previously reported to produce 
new linear azole-containing peptides spongiicolazolicins A and B. Strain CWH03T 
is mesophilic, neutrophilic, and halotolerant streptomycete that forms spiral 
spore chains on aerial mycelium. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed 
that CWH03T was most closely related to Streptomyces tirandamycinicus HNM0039T 
(99.7%), Streptomyces spongiicola HNM0071T (99.4%), 'Streptomyces marianii' 
ICN19T (99.1%) and Streptomyces wuyuanensis CGMCC4.7042T (99.0%). The 
phylogenetic tree prepared using the 16S rRNA gene, as well as the phylogenomic 
tree using the genome BLAST distance phylogeny method and 81 core housekeeping 
genes, respectively, showed that the closest relative of strain CWH03T was S. 
spongiicola HNM0071T. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA 
hybridization values between strains CWH03T and S. spongiicola HNM0071T were 
91.46% and 44.2%, respectively, which were below the thresholds of 96% and 70% 
for prokaryotic conspecific assignation. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of 
strain CWH03T was 72.3%. Whole-cell hydrolysates of strain CWH03T contained 
LL-diaminopimelic acid. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H8) (88.3%), and 
the major fatty acids were iso-C16:0 (28.4%), anteiso-C15:0 (15.0%) and 
iso-C15:0 (12.9%). The major phospholipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, 
phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified phospholipid. 
Based on data obtained from phenotypic, phylogenetic, genomic, and 
chemotaxonomic analyses, strain CWH03T represents a novel species of the genus

type strain is CWH03T ( = NBRC 114659T = TBRC 15780T)."
755,"Although micronuclei are well-known biomarkers of genotoxic damage, the 
biological consequences of micronucleus induction are only poorly understood. To 
further elucidate these consequences, HeLa cells stably expressing histone 2B 
coupled with green fluorescent protein were used for long-term live cell imaging 
to investigate the fate of micronuclei and micronucleated cells after treatment 
of cells with various genotoxic agents (doxorubicin (20, 30 and nM), tert-butyl 
hydroperoxide (tBHP, 50, 100 and 150 µM), radiation (0.5, 1 and 2 Gy), methyl 
methanesulfonate (MMS, 20, 25 and 30 µg/ml) and vinblastine (1, 2 and 3 nM)). 
Most micronuclei persist for multiple cell cycles or reincorporate while 
micronucleated cells were more prone to cell death, senescence and fatal mitotic 
errors compared to non-micronucleated cells, which is consistent with previous 
studies using etoposide. No clear substance-related effects on the fate of 
micronuclei and micronucleated cells were observed. To further investigate the 
fate of micronuclei, extrusion of micronuclei was studied with treatments 
reported as inducing the extrusion of micronuclei. Since extrusion was not 
observed in HeLa cells, the relevance of extrusion of micronuclei remains 
unclear. In addition, degradation of micronuclei was analysed via immunostaining 
of γH2AX, which demonstrated a high level of DNA damage in micronuclei compared 
to the main nuclei. Furthermore, transduction with two reporter genes 
(LC3B-dsRed and LaminB1-dsRed) was conducted followed by long-term live cell 
imaging. While autophagy marker LC3B was not associated with micronuclei, Lamin 
B1 was found in approximately 50% of all micronuclei. While degradation of 
micronuclei was not observed to be a frequent fate of micronuclei, the results 
show impaired stability of DNA and micronuclear envelope indicating rupture of 
micronuclei as a pre-step to chromothripsis."
756,"Dichlorooctylisothiazolinone (DCOIT), which is one of the isothiazolinone 
preservatives, is applied to water-based adhesives in food packaging. This study 
investigated the effects of DCOIT on the embryonic growth and thyroid endocrine 
system using zebrafish. Organism-level (hatchability, survival, and growth), 
hormone-level (triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)), gene-level (genes 
associated with the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis), and microRNA-level 
(microRNAs related to thyroid endocrine disruption) endpoints were measured. 
Significant rise in embryonic coagulation and delayed hatching (≥0.3 μg/L), and 
decreased larval length (30 μg/L) were observed in fish exposed to DCOIT. Lower 
contents of T3 and T4 were observed after exposure to DCOIT, which was 
accompanied by the upregulation of genes associated with the thyrotropin 
releasing hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone and the downregulation of 
genes associated with the thyroid hormone receptors and deiodination. Strong 
influence of DCOIT on dre-miR-193b and -499 may be a critical mechanism to 
inhibit transcription of trαa and trβ, which in turn may affect thyroid hormones 
and development of the organism. Our findings suggest that hypothyroidism 
induced by the exposure to DCOIT is potentially associated with genetic and 
microRNA-level changes, which eventually affects development."
757,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer (PrCa) is one of the most hereditable human cancers, 
however, only a small fraction of patients has been shown to carry deleterious 
variants in known cancer predisposition genes.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing was performed in multiple affected members of 45 
PrCa families to select the best candidate genes behind part of the PrCa missing 
hereditability. Recurrently mutated genes were prioritised, and further 
investigated by targeted next-generation sequencing in the whole early-onset 
and/or familial PrCa series of 462 patients.
RESULTS: PRUNE2 stood out from our analysis when also considering the available 
data on its association with PrCa development. Ten germline pathogenic/likely 
pathogenic variants in the PRUNE2 gene were identified in 13 patients. The most 
frequent variant was found in three unrelated patients and identical-by-descent 
analysis revealed that the haplotype associated with the variant is shared by 
all the variant carriers, supporting the existence of a common ancestor.
DISCUSSION: This is the first report of pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline 
variants in PRUNE2 in PrCa patients, namely in those with early-onset/familial 
disease. Importantly, PRUNE2 was the most frequently mutated gene in the whole 
series, with a deleterious germline variant identified in 2.8% of the patients, 
representing a novel prostate cancer predisposition gene."
758,"WRKY transcription factors play an important role in the immune system and the 
innate defense response of plants. WRKY transcription factors have great 
feedback on nitrogen stress. In this study, bioinformatics was used to detect 
the WRKYs of Panax notoginseng (PnWRKYs). The response of PnWRKYs under nitrogen 
stress was also well studied. PnWRKYs were distributed on 11 chromosomes. 
According to PnWRKY and Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY (AtWRKY) domains, these PnWRKY 
proteins were divided into three groups by phylogenetic analysis. MEME analysis 
showed that almost every member contained motif 1 and motif 2. PlantCARE online 
predicted the cis-acting elements of the promoter. PnWRKY gene family members 
obtained 22 pairs of repeat fragments by collinearity analysis. The expression 
levels of PnWRKYs in different parts (roots, flowers, and leafs) were analyzed 
by the gene expression pattern. They reflected tissue-specific expressions. The 
qRT-PCR experiments were used to detect 74 PnWRKYs under nitrogen stress. The 
results showed that the expression levels of 8 PnWRKYs were significantly 
induced. The PnWRKY gene family may be involved in biotic/abiotic stresses and 
hormone induction. This study will not only lay the foundation to explore the 
functions of PnWRKYs but also provide candidate genes for the future improvement 
of P. notoginseng."
759,"Royal jelly is a gelatinous nutrient secretion produced by the mandibular glands 
of young worker honey bees and has a critical role in honey bee life. In the 
honey bee colonies, queen and worker honey bees have very different morphologies 
and behaviors due to their diet in the larval period, despite having the same 
genome. In comparison, queen bees formed from larvae that feed royal jelly 
exclusively, and worker bees formed from larvae that feed on much less royal 
jelly. DNA methylation has been shown to play a critical role in the development 
of queen and worker honeybees. Alterations in DNA methylation, one of the 
epigenetic mechanisms defined as hereditable nucleotide modifications that occur 
in gene expression without changes in the DNA sequence, are closely related to 
many diseases, especially cancer. Hypermethylation of CpG islands located in the 
promoter regions of genes causes gene silencing and tumor suppressor genes 
epigenetically have silenced in cancer. The inactivation of tumor suppressor 
genes disrupts nearly all cellular pathways in cancer. In contrast to genetic 
alterations, gene silencing by epigenetic modifications may potentially be 
reversed and used in cancer treatment. Royal jelly, which causes epigenetic 
changes in bee colonies, has the potential to cause a change in cancer cells. In 
our study, royal jelly's effects on DNA methyltransferase enzyme and gene 
methylation of RASSF1A tumor suppressor were investigated in human cancer cell 
lines (HeLa, HT29, and A549), and modifications in the gene expression profile 
of royal jelly were determined by next generation sequencing."
760,"Amylose fraction of grain starch is correlated with a type of resistant starch 
with better nutritional quality. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) is the 
known starch synthase, responsible for elongation of linear amylose chains. 
GBSSI expression, activity, and binding to starch and other proteins are the key 
factors that can affect amylose content. Previously, a QTL, qhams7A.1 carrying 
GBSSI mutant allele, was identified through QTL mapping using F2 population of 
the high amylose mutant line, 'TAC 75'. This high amylose mutant line has 
>2-fold higher amylose content than wild variety 'C 306'. In this study, we 
characterized this novel mutant allele, GBSSI.L539P. In vitro starch synthase 
activity of GBSSI.L539P showed improved activity than the wild type (GBSSI-wt). 
When expressed in yeast glycogen synthase mutants (Δgsy1gsy2), GBSSI-wt and 
GBSSI.L539P partially complemented the glycogen synthase (gsy1gsy2) activity in 
yeast. Structural analysis by circular dichroism (CD) and homology modelling 
showed no significant structural distortion in the mutant enzyme. Molecular 
docking studies suggested that the residue Leu539 is distant from the catalytic 
active site (ADP binding pocket) and had no detectable conformational changes in 
active site. Both wild and mutant enzymes were assayed for starch binding in 
vitro, and demonstrating higher affinity of the GBSSI.L539P mutant for starch 
than the wild type. The present study indicated that distant residue (L539P) 
influenced GBSSI activity by affecting its starch-binding ability. Therefore, it 
may be a potential molecular target for enhanced amylose content in grain."
761,"The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rising worldwide. Here, we 
identified SCNN1B as an outlier down-regulated in CRC and it functions as a 
tumor suppressor. SCNN1B mRNA and protein expression were down-regulated in 
primary CRC and CRC cells. In a tissue microarray cohort (N = 153), SCNN1B 
protein was an independent prognostic factor for favorable outcomes in CRC. 
Ectopic expression of SCNN1B in CRC cell lines suppressed cell proliferation, 
induced apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest, and suppressed cell migration in 
vitro. Xenograft models validated tumor suppressive function of SCNN1B in vivo. 
Mechanistically, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that SCNN1B 
correlates with KRAS signaling. Consistently, MAPK qPCR and kinase arrays 
revealed that SCNN1B suppressed MAPK signaling. In particular, SCNN1B 
overexpression suppressed p-MEK/p-ERK expression and SRE-mediated transcription 
activities, confirming blockade of Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade. Mechanistically, 
SCNN1B did not affect KRAS activation, instead impairing activation of c-Raf by 
inducing its inhibitory phosphorylation and targeting active c-Raf for 
degradation. The ectopic expression of c-Raf fully rescued cell proliferation 
and colony formation in SCNN1B-overexpressing CRC cells, confirming c-Raf as the 
principal molecular target of SCNN1B. In summary, we identified SCNN1B as a 
tumor suppressor by functioning as a c-Raf antagonist, which in turn suppressed 
oncogenic MEK-ERK signaling."
762,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) results in rapid fluctuation of 
testosterone (T) between near-castrate and supraphysiological levels and has 
shown promise in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Its 
clinical effects may be mediated through induction of DNA damage, and 
preclinical studies suggest synergy with PARP inhibitors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, Phase II trial testing olaparib 
plus BAT (T cypionate/enanthate 400 mg every 28 days) with ongoing androgen 
deprivation. Planned recruitment was 30 subjects (equal proportions with/without 
homologous recombination repair [HRR] gene mutations) with mCRPC post 
abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. The primary objective was to determine PSA50 
response (PSA decline ≥50% from baseline) rate at 12-weeks. The primary analysis 
utilized the entire (intent-to-treat [ITT]) cohort, with those dropping out 
early counted as non-responders. Secondary/exploratory analyses were in those 
treated beyond 12-weeks (response-evaluable cohort).
RESULTS: Thirty-six patients enrolled and 6 discontinued prior to response 
assessment. In the ITT cohort, PSA50 response rate at 12-weeks was 11/36 (31%; 
95% CI 17-48%), and 16/36 (44%, 95% CI 28-62%) had a PSA50 response at any time 
on-study. After a median follow-up of 19 months, the median 
clinical/radiographic progression-free survival in the ITT cohort was 13.0 
months (95% CI 7-17). Clinical outcomes were similar regardless of HRR gene 
mutational status.
CONCLUSIONS: BAT plus olaparib is associated with high response rates and long 
PFS. Clinical benefit was observed regardless of HRR gene mutational status."
763,"Disruption of the gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD) may lead to motor 
symptoms and PD pathogenesis. Recently, the neuroprotective potential of 
different PPARδ-agonists has been shown. We aimed to reveal the effects of 
erucic acid, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)-ligand in 
rotenone-induced PD model in zebrafish, focusing on the gut-brain axis. Adult 
zebrafish were exposed to rotenone and erucic acid for 30 days. LC-MS/MS 
analysis was performed. Raw files were analyzed by Proteome Discoverer 2.4 
software, peptide lists were searched against Danio rerio proteins. STRING 
database was used for protein annotations or interactions. Lipid peroxidation 
(LPO), nitric oxide (No), alkaline phosphatase, superoxide dismutase, 
glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase, and the expressions of 
PD-related genes were determined. Immunohistochemical tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) 
staining was performed. LC-MS/MS analyses allowed identification of over 2000 
proteins in each sample. 2502 and 2707 proteins overlapped for intestine and 
brain. 196 and 243 significantly dysregulated proteins in the brain and 
intestines were found in rotenone groups. Erucic acid treatment corrected the 
changes in the expression of proteins associated with cytoskeletal organization, 
transport, and localization and improved locomotor activity, expressions of TH, 
PD-related genes (lrrk2, park2, park7, pink1), and oxidant-damage in brain and 
intestines in the rotenone group as evidenced by decreased LPO, No, and 
increased GST. Our results showed benefical effects of erucic acid as a 
PPARδ-ligand in neurotoxin-induced PD model in zebrafish. We believe our study, 
will shed light on the mechanism of the effects of PPARδ agonists and ω9-fatty 
acids in the gut-brain axis of PD."
764,"Phytosterols can be used by microorganisms as carbon and energy sources and 
completely degraded into CO2 and H2O. The catabolic pathway of phytosterols was 
well characterized in many microorganisms. Blocking the steroid core ring 
degradation by deletions of fadE30 and fadD3 genes, two important steroid 
intermediates, 3aα-H-4α-(3'-Propionic 
acid)-5α-hydroxy-7aβ-methylhexahydro-1-indanone-δ-lactone (sitolactone, or HIL) 
and 3aα-H-4α-(3'-propionic acid)-7aβ-methylhexahydro-1,5-indanedione (HIP) can 
be accumulated. They are currently used to synthesize nor-steroid drugs with 
an α-methyl group or without the methyl group at the C10-position, such as 
estrone and norethindrone. In this study, a key gene involved in the 
bioconversion of HIP to HIL was identified in Mycolicibacterium neoaurum. 
Through heterologous expression, gene hipR was found to be involved in the 
reduction of the C5 keto group of HIP to a hydroxyl group, leading to 
spontaneously lactonization into HIL in vitro. Through gene complementation and 
knockout, HipR functions were verified and two HIP degradation pathways in vivo 
were elucidated. The finding of this research facilitated the understanding of 
the metabolic pathway of sterols, and was directly applied to engineering robust 
production strains by overexpression or knockout of related genes."
765,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are standard of care in advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, not all patients benefit, even 
among PD-L1 tumor proportional score (TPS) ≥50%, indicating an unmet need for 
additional biomarkers such as those assessing the tumor immune microenvironment 
(TIME). DetermaIO is a 27-gene assay that classifies TIME and has previously 
demonstrated association with ICI response.
METHODS: FFPE samples were selected from BC Cancer and West Clinic Cancer Center 
patients with performance status (PS) ≤2 who received at least 2 cycles of ICI 
monotherapy in the first (1L) or second line (2L). IO scores were generated and 
analyzed for association with PFS and OS.
RESULTS: In the entire cohort (N=147), IO score was significantly associated 
with OS (HR=0.68, 95%CI 0.47-0.99, P = .042) and PFS (HR=0.62, 95%CI 0.43-0.88, 
P = .0069). In 1L treated patients (PD-L1≥50%, N=78), IO score was significantly 
associated with PFS (HR=0.55, 95%CI 0.32-0.94, P = .028). In exploratory 
analyses, IO score was associated with benefit in 1L PS2 patients for OS 
(HR = 0.26, 95%CI 0.091-0.74, P = .012) and PFS (HR = 0.27, 95%CI 0.098-0.72, 
P = .0095) which was confirmed in PFS subgroup analysis in the independent West 
Cancer Center study (N=13 HR=0.14, 95%CI 0.027-0.76, P = .023).
CONCLUSION: These data confirm the association of DetermaIO with ICI clinical 
benefit in NSCLC, and expand on previous studies by demonstrating that first 
line treated PD-L1≥50% patients can further be stratified by IO score to 
identify efficacy. Exploratory analysis suggested that the IO score identifies 
benefit in patients with poor PS."
766,"Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a rare genetic disease caused 
germline mutation of FAS gene, gene encoding Fas ligand or Caspase 10 gene. 
However, in 20% of all ALPS patients, genetic defect is unknown. We presented a 
case of a 20-year-old male with a history of autoimmune lymphoproliferative 
syndrome (ALPS; confirmed by genetic study) who came to our medical center with 
a concern for malignancy. Although no malignancy was detected, his lack of IgA, 
very low level of IgG (requiring therapy with intravenous IgG) and highly 
elevated polyclonal IgM (hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome) were unusual findings 
because ALPS patients with hypergammaglobulinemia usually demonstrate elevated 
IgA or IgG."
767,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify new biomarkers for ovarian cancer 
screening based on bioinformatics analysis and q-PCR validation.
METHODS: In total, five independent ovarian cancer patient cohorts were included 
to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Thereafter, Gene Ontology 
(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were 
employed to clarify the functions of DEGs. The selected DEGs were screened by 
STRING database and Cytoscape software to obtain hub genes. Additionally, 
univariate Cox hazard analysis revealed the relevance between hub genes and 
patient survival. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to 
determine the accuracy of hub genes in discriminating ovarian cancer. Finally, 
q-PCR analysis was conducted to validate hub gene expression in ovarian cancer 
tissues.
RESULTS: From gene expression profiles of five GEO datasets, 85 common 
up-regulated and 64 common down-regulated DEGs were identified. Moreover, the 
up-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in mitosis related biological processes 
while the down-regulated DEGs were mainly enriched in amino acid metabolisms. In 
hub genes analysis, 10 and 9 hub genes, respectively, were obtained from 
up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs. High expression of hub gene FGF13 was 
confirmed to be significantly related to a better ovarian cancer survival. The 
selected hub genes, except for FGF13, showed high accuracy in the discrimination 
of ovarian cancer. According to q-PCR validation in ovarian cancer tissues, 
CDC20, CCNB1, BUB1B, KIF20A, BRIC5, CAV1, MEIS2, and CFH were finally considered 
as the potential diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: FGF13 is a potential prognostic biomarker for predicting patient 
survival outcome. In addition, CDC20, CCNB1, BUB1B, KIF20A, BIRC5, CAV1, MEIS2, 
and CFH are the potential biomarkers for ovarian cancer discrimination."
768,"OBJECTIVE: Shc SH2 domain-binding protein (SHCBP1) is involved in regulating 
tumour progression in a variety of tumour types. The aim of this study was to 
analyze the prognostic landscape of SHCBP1 in pan-cancer and investigate the 
relationship between SHCBP1 expression and tumour immune microenvironment.
METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and genotype tissue expression (GTEx) 
database were used for obtaining the required data for the evaluation of SHCBP1 
expression. The clinical characteristics and prognostic role of SHCBP1 were 
analyzed by using TCGA cohort. This was followed by gene set enrichment analysis 
by R software. Based on TCGA pan-cancer data, the correlation between SHCBP1 
expression and immune infiltration, immune-related genes, microsatellite 
instability (MSI), and tumour mutational burden (TMB) was discussed. Finally, 
the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 192 anti-cancer drugs 
were obtained from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database 
and their correlation with SHCBP1 was analyzed.
RESULTS: SHCBP1 was upregulated in most tumours showing a significant 
association with poor prognosis. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed SHCBP1 
relation to the immunity, cell cycle, and cancer pathway in various types of 
tumour. SHCBP1 expression also showed a positive correlation with 
tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and immunosuppressive genes including 
TGFBR1, PD-L1 and TGFB1 and so on. In addition, high expression of SHCBP1 in 
patients was associated with resistance to a variety of anti-tumour drugs.
CONCLUSION: The present study confirms SHCBP1 as a poor prognostic marker of 
cancers. Its high expression is suggested to be involved in immunological 
resistance to a variety of anti-tumour drugs."
769,"OBJECTIVE: The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) colorectal neoplasia differentially 
expressed (CRNDE) is considered a carcinogenic promoter in various human 
malignancies. However, the role and underlying mechanism of action of CRNDE 
during carcinogenesis in neuroblastoma remain unknown.
METHODS: CRNDE transcript levels were detected in neuroblastoma tissues and 
adjacent normal tissues. The effects of CRNDE overexpression and knockdown on 
the viability of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS cells were determined using the Cell 
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Flow cytometry was performed to measure the role 
of CRNDE in apoptosis and the cell cycle in neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, the 
transwell assay was used to evaluate the role of CRNDE in the migration and 
invasion of tumor cells. The levels of ERK/MAPK pathway-related proteins were 
evaluated using western blotting. The in vivo role of CRNDE in tumor growth and 
apoptosis was evaluated in a xenograft mouse model of human neuroblastoma.
RESULTS: The relative expression of CRNDE was significantly higher in 
neuroblastoma tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, knockdown 
of CRNDE inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and cell cycle 
arrest, whereas elevation of CRNDE promoted cell growth and inhibited apoptosis 
in neuroblastoma cells. In addition, depletion of CRNDE suppressed migration and 
invasion, whereas overexpression of CRNDE enhanced the migratory and invasive 
potential of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS cells. At the mechanistic level, western 
blotting showed that CRNDE exerted its oncogenic role by affecting the ERK/MAPK 
signaling pathway. Furthermore, animal experiments confirmed that CRNDE promotes 
tumor growth and inhibits apoptosis in neuroblastoma in vivo.
CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that CRNDE plays a critical role in the 
proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of neuroblastoma by altering 
the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, representing a novel molecular target for the 
treatment of neuroblastoma."
770,"OBJECTIVE: We intended to study the specific function of microRNA-126-5p 
(miR-126-5p) in myocardial infarction (MI) and its underlying mechanisms of 
action in hypoxia-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
METHODS: Expression of miR-126-5p and its target gene homeodomain interacting 
protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) was evaluated by Reverse transcription quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. Flow 
cytometry and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays were used to observe cell 
apoptosis and viability. Luciferase reporter gene assay was prepared for 
verifying the regulatory relationship between miR-126-5p and HIPK2. The levels 
of oxidative stress biomarkers (SOD, ROS, and MDA) were determined using 
commercial assay kits. The inflammatory response in the cells was analyzed by 
ELISA.
RESULTS: MiR-126-5p expression upregulated in hypoxia-treated HUVECs compared to 
the untreated-HUVECs. Importantly, miR-126-5p knockdown suppressed 
hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis in HUVECs. In addition, the hypoxia-induced 
oxidative stress and inflammatory response were also significantly inhibited by 
miR-126-5p knockdown in HUVECs. Mechanically, miR-126-5p targets HIPK2. In 
rescue assay, HIPK2 knockdown reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-126-5p 
knockdown on hypoxia-induced cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory 
response in hypoxia-treated HUVECs.
CONCLUSION: MiR-126-5p targeted by HIPK2 regulates hypoxia induced endothelial 
injury in HUVECs, which indicated that miR-126-5p may be a molecular target for 
MI treatment."
771,"OBJECTIVE: Chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells 
(BMSCs) plays an important role in osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. Studies have 
reported the association of transforming growth factor beta-3 (TGF-β3) with 
chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In this study, the upstream mechanism and 
functions of TGF-β3 in chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs were explored.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Flow cytometry was performed for the positive and negative 
MSC markers. Chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs was evaluated by Alcian blue 
staining. Gene expression and protein expression levels were measured by RT-qPCR 
and western blotting, respectively. Relationship between let-7a-3p and TGF-β3 
was confirmed using bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter and RNA 
pulldown assays. Subcellular distributions of TGF-β3 and let-7a-3p were 
determined by FISH. In this study, BMSCs were identified to possess the 
characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells. TGF-β3 was found to induce 
chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Mechanically, TGF-β3 was verified to be 
targeted by let-7a-3p. In rescue assays, let-7a-3p overexpression reversed the 
effects of TGF-β3 overexpression on chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs.
CONCLUSION: Let-7a-3p inhibits chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow 
mesenchymal stem cells by targeting TGF-β3."
772,"BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and 
function, diminishes life quality in elderly people. Improving the capacity of 
skeletal muscle differentiation is expected to counteract sarcopenia. However, 
the mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle differentiation are complex, and 
effective therapeutic targets are largely unknown.
METHODS: The human Gene Expression Omnibus database, aged mice and primary 
skeletal muscle cells were used to assess the expression level of pyruvate 
dehydrogenase B (PDHB) in human and mouse aged state. d-Galactose ( 
d-gal)-induced sarcopenia mouse model and two classic cell models (C2C12 and 
HSkMC) were used to assess the myogenic effect of PDHB and the underlying 
mechanisms via immunocytochemistry, western blotting, quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction, RNA interference or overexpression, dual-luciferase 
reporter assay, RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics.
RESULTS: We identified that a novel target PDHB promoted myogenic 
differentiation. PDHB expression decreased in aged mouse muscle relative to the 
young state (-50% of mRNA level, P < 0.01) and increased during mouse and 
primary human muscle cell differentiation (+3.97-fold, P < 0.001 and +3.79-fold, 
P < 0.001). Knockdown or overexpression of PDHB modulated the expression of 
genes related to muscle differentiation, namely, myogenic factor 5 (Myf5) (-46%, 
P < 0.01 and -27%, P < 0.05; +1.8-fold, P < 0.01), myogenic differentiation 
(MyoD) (-55%, P < 0.001 and -34%, P < 0.01; +2.27-fold, P < 0.001), myogenin 
(MyoG) (-60%, P < 0.001 and -70%, P < 0.001; +5.46-fold, P < 0.001) and myosin 
heavy chain (MyHC) (-70%, P < 0.001 and -69%, P < 0.001; +3.44-fold, P < 0.001) 
in both C2C12 cells and HSkMC. Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed 
that PDHB knockdown suppressed pyruvate metabolism (P < 0.001) and up-regulated 
ariadne RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (Arih2) (+7.23-fold, P < 0.001) in 
cellular catabolic pathways. The role of forkhead box P1 (FoxP1) (+4.18-fold, 
P < 0.001)-mediated Arih2 transcription was the key downstream regulator of PDHB 
in muscle differentiation. PDHB overexpression improved d-gal-induced muscle 
atrophy in mice, which was characterized by significant increases in grip 
strength, muscle mass and mean muscle cross-sectional area (1.19-fold to 
1.5-fold, P < 0.01, P < 0.05 and P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive results show that PDHB plays a sarcoprotective 
role by suppressing the FoxP1-Arih2 axis and may serve as a therapeutic target 
in sarcopenia."
773,"Enhancing yield during bacterial enzyme production could have positive economic 
and environmental impacts. For cell factories, such improvements in yields could 
potentially be obtained by fine-tuning the metabolic processes and their 
regulatory mechanisms for gene candidates. In pursuit of such candidates, we 
performed RNA-sequencing of two α-amylase producing Bacillus strains and predict 
hundreds of putative novel non-coding transcribed regions. Complex operons that 
are regulated by a wide variety of transcription factors, non-coding and 
structured RNAs add to the challenge of finding yield-affecting candidates. 
Surprisingly, we found that non-coding genomic regions are proportionally 
undergoing the highest changes in expression during fermentation (75% of novel 
RNA predictions had absolute logFC > 2). Since these classes of RNA are also 
understudied, we targeted the corresponding genomic regions with CRIPSRi 
knockdown to test for any potential impact on the yield. From differentially 
expressed annotations, including both novel candidate and prior annotated 
ncRNAs, we selected 53 non-coding candidates. The targeting with CRISPRi 
knockdowns transcription in a genomic region on both the sense and the antisense 
strand. Thus, the CRISPRi experiment cannot link causes for yield changes to the 
sense or antisense disruption. Nevertheless, we observed on several instances 
with strong changes in enzyme yield. The knockdown targeting the genomic region 
for a putative antisense RNA of the 3' UTR of the skfA-skfH operon led to a 21% 
increase in yield. In contrast, the knockdown targeting the genomic regions of 
putative antisense RNAs of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (ctaD), the sigma 
factor sigH, and the uncharacterized gene yhfT decreased yields by 31 to 43%. We 
discuss how the findings of this study can be further investigated to elucidate 
potential direct and indirect mechanisms on yield changes."
774,"In this review, we describe the genomic and physiological features of the yeast 
species predominantly isolated from Nuruk, a starter for traditional Korean rice 
wines, and Jang, a traditional Korean fermented soy product. Nuruk and Jang have 
several prevalent yeast species, including Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, 
Hyphopichia burtonii, and Debaryomyces hansenii complex, which belong to the CUG 
clade showing high osmotic tolerance. Comparative genomics revealed that the 
interspecies hybridization within yeast species for generating heterozygous 
diploid genomes occurs frequently as an evolutional strategy in the fermentation 
environment of Nuruk and Jang. Through gene inventory analysis based on the 
high-quality reference genome of S. fibuligera, new genes involved in cellulose 
degradation and volatile aroma biosynthesis and applicable to the production of 
novel valuable enzymes and chemicals can be discovered. The integrated genomic 
and transcriptomic analysis of Hyphopichia yeasts, which exhibit strong 
halotolerance, provides insights into the novel mechanisms of salt and 
osmo-stress tolerance for survival in fermentation environments with a low-water 
activity and high-concentration salts. In addition, Jang yeast isolates, such as 
D. hansenii, show probiotic potential for the industrial application of yeast 
species beyond fermentation starters to diverse human health sectors."
775,"CRISPR activation and interference (CRISPRa/i) technology offers the 
unprecedented possibility of achieving regulated gene expression both in vitro 
and in vivo. The DNA pairing specificity of a nuclease dead Cas9 (dCas9) is 
exploited to precisely target a transcriptional activator or repressor in 
proximity to a gene promoter. This permits both the study of phenotypes arising 
from gene modulation for investigative purposes, and the development of 
potential therapeutics. As with virtually all other organ systems, the 
cardiovascular system can deeply benefit from a broader utilisation of 
CRISPRa/i. However, application of this technology is still in its infancy. 
Significant areas for improvement include the identification of novel and more 
effective transcriptional regulators that can be docked to dCas9, and the 
development of more efficient methods for their delivery and expression in vivo."
776,"PURPOSE: A broad spectrum of autosomal dominant inherited retinal diseases 
(IRDs), including both mild macular pattern dystrophies and severe cone-rod 
degenerations, is associated with PRPH2 variants (""peripherinopathies""). We 
present a detailed clinical and molecular characterization of patients affected 
by peripherinopathies, aiming to expand the mutational spectrum and propose 
novel genotype-phenotype correlations.
DESIGN: Observational, retrospective, case series.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with an IRD related to a molecularly proven PRPH2 
variant.
METHODS: Data from ophthalmological examinations and retinal imaging were 
collected for each follow-up visit. The standard imaging protocol included 
optical coherence tomography (OCT), blue-light autofluorescence (BAF), 
near-infrared autofluorescence (NIR-AF), and ultra-widefield fundus imaging. 
Genetic analysis was performed with a genomic approach by Next Generation 
Sequencing (NGS).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of ophthalmic examination, retinal imaging, and 
molecular genetic analysis.
RESULTS: Overall, a total of 19 patients with an IRD and a (likely) pathogenic 
PRPH2 variant were identified. Their age at presentation had a median of 48 
years, while the symptomatic disease onset was in their 30s or 40s in 74% of 
cases. The median follow-up time was 4 years. Clinically, 6 patients were 
diagnosed with cone-rod dystrophy and 13 with pattern dystrophy. Among the 13 
PRPH2 pathogenic variants identified in our cohort, 7 were missense, 3 nonsense, 
2 frame-shifting, and 1 splice-site. Missense variants in the D2 loop were 
associated with cone-rod dystrophies and poor visual prognosis, whereas 
predicted loss-of-function alleles with pattern dystrophies and retention of a 
good visual function into adulthood. Seven variants were novel and never 
associated to a clinical phenotype: c.68delT, c.290G>A, c.413T>G, c.642C>G, 
c.702_706dupCAGTT, c.771_772delinsGA, c.850C>G.
CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we report the findings of a retrospective case series that 
provided a detailed clinical and molecular characterization of 19 patients 
harboring 13 different PRPH2 pathogenic variants, 7 of which were previously 
unreported, expanding the mutational spectrum of the PRPH2 gene. 
Loss-of-function variants might be preferentially associated with mild pattern 
dystrophies while missense dominant negative variants with severely blinding 
cone-rod degenerations. Further studies are needed to better define pathogenetic 
mechanisms and the functional effects of most variants, in order to allow the 
development of successful gene therapy."
777,"Ammonia is one of the most important aquatic environmental factors, which is of 
great concern. In order to evaluate the effect of ammonia on guppy (Poecilia 
reticulate), fish were exposed to increased concentrations (0, 12.50, 25.00, 
41.67, 62.50 mg/L) of ammonia for 48 h. After exposure, we measured the anxiety 
behavior, antioxidant enzymes and pro-inflammation genes (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) 
of guppy. The results showed that ammonia stress induced fish anxiety, which was 
manifested by the increased latency to enter the upper half and decreased time 
spent in upper half compared with control fish. The guppy showed oxidative 
stress after 48 h of ammonia stress as evidenced by decreases in the activities 
of antioxidant enzymes and an increase in lipid hydroperoxide content. With 
prolonged ammonia stress, the expressions of HSP70, HSP90, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 
mRNA at first had an increasing trend, and then decreased, all of which were 
significantly higher than the control levels at 12 h and 24 h after ammonia 
stress (P < 0.05). Ammonia significantly upregulated these genes mRNA levels 
after 48 h exposure, suggesting that heat shock proteins and innate immune 
system may try to protect cells from oxidative stress induced by ammonia stress. 
Our study showed that higher ammonia exposure induced oxidative stress in 
exposed fish, since inhibition of antioxidant enzymes activity and increases in 
lipid peroxidation, and inflammation occurred. Furthermore, the results will be 
helpful to understand the mechanism of ammonia toxicity in guppys."
778,"Nearly 14% of disease-causing germline variants result from disruption of mRNA 
splicing. Most (67%) DNA variants predicted in silico to disrupt splicing end up 
classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). We developed and 
validated an analytic workflow - Splice Effect Event Resolver (SPEER) - that 
uses mRNA sequencing to reveal significant deviations in splicing, pinpoints the 
DNA variants potentially responsible, and measures the deleterious effect of the 
altered splicing on mRNA transcripts, providing evidence to assess the 
pathogenicity of the variant. SPEER was used to analyze leukocyte RNA encoding 
63 hereditary cancer syndrome genes in 20,317 individuals undergoing clinical 
genetic testing. Among 3,563 (17.5%) individuals with at least one DNA variant 
predicted to affect splicing, 971 (4.8%) had altered splicing with a deleterious 
effect on the transcript and 40 had altered splicing due to a DNA variant 
located outside our laboratory's reportable range. Integrating SPEER results 
into variant interpretation allowed reclassification of VUS to P/LP in 0.4% and 
to B/LB in 5.9% of the 20,317 patients. SPEER evidence had a significantly 
higher impact for P/LP and B/LB classifications in non-White individuals 
compared to non-Hispanic White individuals, illustrating that evidence derived 
from RNA splicing analysis may help reduce ethnic/ancestral disparities in 
genetic testing."
779,"Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by 
mutations in the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) gene, located on 
chromosomal region 11q13. This results in reduced cholesterol and increased 
7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) levels. Accumulation of 7DHC in patients with SLOS 
can affect multiple organs and display a broad phenotypic expression. Ophthalmic 
abnormalities related to SLOS are variable but the most common is 
blepharoptosis. Over 50% of these patients present with self-injurious behavior, 
such as head banging, which can result in ocular complications and blindness. We 
report the first case of peripheral avascularity of the retina in a patient with 
SLOS. Physicians should be aware of the potential ocular complications 
associated with SLOS and confounding factors, such as prematurity, given that 
referral is usually delayed due to the lack of awareness of these potentially 
blinding associations. This case highlights the importance of early referral and 
continuous ophthalmologic follow-up in preventing further deterioration of 
visual development and complications that can lead to blindness."
780,"Selenium has good antitumor effects in vitro, but the hypoxic microenvironment 
in solid tumors makes its clinical efficacy unsatisfactory. We hypothesized that 
the combination with oxygen therapy might improve the treatment efficacy of 
selenium in hypoxic tumors through the changes of redox environment. In this 
work, two selenium compounds, Na2SeO3 and CysSeSeCys, were selected to 
interrogate their therapeutic effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under 
different oxygen levels. In tumor-bearing mice, both selenium compounds 
significantly inhibited the tumor growth, and combined with oxygen therapy 
further reduced the tumor volume about 50%. In vitro HepG2 cell experiments, 
selenium induced autophagy and delayed apoptosis under hypoxia (1% O2), while 
inhibited autophagy and accelerated apoptosis under hyperoxia (60% O2). We found 
that, in contrast to hypoxia, the hyperoxic environment facilitated the H2Se, 
produced by the selenium metabolism in cells, to be rapidly oxidized to generate 
H2O2, leading to inhibit the expression level of Nrf2 and to increase that of 
phosphorylation of p38 and MKK4, resulting in inhibiting autophagy and 
accelerating apoptosis. Once the Nrf2 gene was knocked down, selenium compounds 
combined with hyperoxia treatment would further activate the MAPK signaling 
pathway and further increase apoptosis. These findings highlight oxygen can 
significantly enhance the anti-HCC effect of selenium compounds through 
regulating the Nrf2 and MAPK signaling pathways, thus providing novel 
therapeutic strategy for the hypoxic tumors and pave the way for the application 
of selenium in clinical treatment."
781,"OBJECTIVE: To unravel the differential transcriptomic behaviour of human 
androgenotes (AGs) and parthenogenotes (PGs) throughout the first cell cycles, 
analyze the differential expression of genes related to key biological 
processes, and determine the time frame for embryonic genome activation in AGs 
and PGs.
DESIGN: Laboratory Study.
SETTING: Private fertility clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: Mature oocytes were retrieved from healthy donors and subjected to 
artificial oocyte activation using calcium ionophore and puromycin to generate 
PGs (n=6) or enucleated and subjected to intracytoplasmic sperm injection to 
generate AGs (n=10).
INTERVENTIONS: Uniparental constructs at different early stages of development 
were disaggregated into constituent single cells (we suggest the terms 
parthenocytes and androcytes) to characterize the single-cell transcriptional 
landscape using next-generation sequencing.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED: Transcriptomic profiles comparison between different 
stages of early development in AGs and PGs.
RESULTS: The uniparental transcriptomic profiles at the first cell cycle showed 
68 downregulated and 26 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PGs 
compared to AGs. During the third cell cycle, we found 60 upregulated and 504 
downregulated DEGs in PGs compared to AGs. In the fourth cell cycle, 1771 
upregulated and 1171 downregulated DEGs were found in PGs compared to AGs. The 
AGs and PGs had reduced EGA profiles during the first three cell cycles, and a 
spike of EGA at the fourth cell cycle was observed in PGs.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomic analysis of AGs and PGs revealed their complementary 
behaviour until the fourth cell cycle. AGs undergo a low wave of transcription 
during the first cell cycle, which reflects the paternal contribution to cell 
cycle coordination, mechanics of cell division and novel transcription 
regulation. Maternal transcripts are most prominent in the third and fourth cell 
cycles, with amplification of transcription related to morphogenic progression 
and embryonic developmental competence acquisition. Regarding EGA, in PGs, a 
primitive EGA begins at the one-cell stage, and gradually progresses until the 
four-cell stage, when crucial epigenetic reprogramming (through methylation) is 
upregulated. In addition, our longitudinal single-cell transcriptomic analysis 
challenges that the zygote and early-cleavage stages are the only totipotent 
entities, by revealing potential totipotency in cleavage-stage AGs and 
implications of paternal transcripts."
782,"Fungal hydroxylation of steroids is a key step in the industrial production of 
various steroid drugs. The main enzymes that enable these reactions are 
Cytochrome P450s (CYP), though very few industrially important CYPs have been 
identified and characterized. In this study, we identified a CYP enzyme (CYP-N2) 
and a cytochrome P450 reductase (CPRns) from Nigrospora sphaerica 722 by a 
combination of transcriptome sequencing and heterologous expression in Pichia 
pastoris. Gene CYP-N2 co-expressed with CPRns in Pichia pastoris GS115 showed 
6β- and 15α-hydroxylation activities on progesterone. Different hydroxylation 
specificity of CYP-N2 was observed on different steroid substrates. CYP-N2 
showed 1α-hydroxylation on cortisone and 1α-hydroxylation and 6β-hydroxylation 
activities on androstenedione (AD). With dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as a 
substrate, the hydroxylated products of CYP-N2 included 7α-hydroxy-DHEA and 
7α,15α-dihydroxy-DHEA. In order to find out the mechanisms of hydroxylation 
specificities of CYP-N2 on different steroid substrates and elucidate its 
biological function, new generation artificial intelligence technology AlphaFold 
2 was used to predict the function-structure of CYP-N2 with high reliability. 
Through molecular docking and minimum binding energy analysis, it was concluded 
that the residues binding all substrates were located in the same substrate 
binding pocket and the different hydroxylation abilities were due to the 
different binding conformations of different substrates in the binding pocket. 
Alanine scanning mutagenesis was used to verify key amino acids identified by 
the molecular docking with steroid substrates. The 128 THR mutation resulted in 
conversion rate increase for substrates AD and cortisone by 2.6-fold and 
2.1-fold respectively. The information obtained in this study is beneficial to 
better understanding of the structural basis of regio-, stereo-selectivity and 
substrate specificity of fungal P450s, thus facilitating the engineering of more 
efficient steroid hydroxylases for industrial applications."
783,"The last two decades have seen the emergence of three highly pathogenic 
coronaviruses with zoonotic origins, which prompted immediate attention to the 
underlying cause and prevention of future outbreaks. Intensification of camel 
husbandry in the Middle East has resulted in increased human-camel interactions, 
which has led to the spread of potentially zoonotic viruses with human spillover 
risks like MERS-coronavirus, camelpox virus, etc. Type-I interferons function as 
the first line of defense against invading viruses and are pivotal for limiting 
viral replication and immune-mediated pathologies. Seven novel dromedary camel 
interferon delta genes were identified and cloned. Functional characterization 
of this novel class of IFNs from the mammalian suborder tylopoda is reported for 
the first time. The camel interferon-delta proteins resemble the reported 
mammalian counterparts in sequence similarity, conservation of cysteines, and 
phylogenetic proximity. Prokaryotically expressed recombinant camel 
interferon-δ1 induced IFN-stimulated gene expression and also exerted antiviral 
action against camelpox virus, an endemic zoonotic virus. The pre-treatment of 
camel kidney cells with recombinant camel IFN-δ1 increased cell survival and 
reduced camelpox virus in a dose-dependent manner. The identification of novel 
IFNs from species with zoonotic spillover risk such as camels, and evaluating 
their antiviral effects in-vitro will play a key role in improving 
immunotherapies against viruses and expanding the arsenal to combat emerging 
zoonotic pathogens."
784,"The anterior segment is a critical component of the visual system. Developing 
independent of the retina, the AS relies partially on cranial neural crest cells 
(cNCC) as its earliest progenitors. The cNCCs are thought to first adopt a 
periocular mesenchyme (POM) fate and subsequently target to the AS upon 
formation of the rudimentary retina. AS targeted POM is termed anterior segment 
mesenchyme (ASM). However, it remains unknown when and how the switch from cNCC 
to POM or POM to ASM takes place. As such, we sought to visualize the timing of 
these transitions and identify the regulators of this process using the 
zebrafish embryo model. Using two color fluorescence in situ hybridization, we 
tracked cNCC and ASM target gene expression from 12 to 24hpf. In doing so, we 
identified a tfap2a and foxC1a co-expression at 16hpf, identifying the earliest 
ASM to arrive at the AS. Interestingly, expression of two other key regulators 
of NCC, foxD3 and sox10 was not associated with early ASM. Functional analysis 
of tfap2a, foxD3 and sox10 revealed that tfap2a and foxD3 are both critical 
regulators of ASM specification and AS formation while sox10 was dispensable for 
either specification or development of the AS. Using genetic knockout lines, we 
show that in the absence of tfap2a or foxD3 function ASM cells are not 
specified, and subsequently the AS is malformed. Conversely, sox10 genetic 
mutants or CRISPR Cas9 injected embryos displayed no defects in ASM 
specification, migration or the AS. Lastly, using transcriptomic analysis, we 
show that GFP + cNCCs derived from Tg [foxD3:GFP] and Tg [foxC1b:GFP] share 
expression profiles consistent with ASM development whereas cNCCs isolated from 
Tg [sox10:GFP] exhibit expression profiles associated with vasculogenesis, 
muscle function and pigmentation. Taken together, we propose that the earliest 
stage of anterior segment mesenchyme (ASM) specification in zebrafish is 
approximately 16hpf and involves tfap2a/foxC1a positive cNCCs."
785,"BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with poor 
prognosis, and new treatment options are urgently needed. About 34%-39% of 
primary TNBCs show a low expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2-low), which is a target for new anti-HER2 drugs. However, little is known 
about the frequency and the prognostic value of HER2-low in metastatic TNBC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively included patients with TNBC from five 
European countries for this international, multicenter analysis. 
Triple-negativity had to be shown in a metastatic site or in the primary breast 
tumor diagnosed simultaneously or within 3 years before metastatic disease. 
HER2-low was defined as immunohistochemically (IHC) 1+ or 2+ without ERBB2 gene 
amplification. Survival probabilities were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier 
method, and multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by Cox regression 
models.
RESULTS: In total, 691 patients, diagnosed between January 2006 and February 
2021, were assessable. The incidence of HER2-low was 32.0% [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 28.5% to 35.5%], with similar proportions in metastases (n = 265; 
29.8%) and primary tumors (n = 425; 33.4%; P = 0.324). The median overall 
survival (OS) in HER2-low and HER2-0 TNBC was 18.6 and 16.1 months, respectively 
(HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.83-1.19; P = 0.969). Similarly, in multivariable analysis, 
HER2-low had no significant impact on OS (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.79-1.13; P = 0.545). 
No difference in prognosis was observed between HER2 IHC 0/1+ and IHC 2+ tumors 
(HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.69-1.17; P = 0.414).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large international dataset of metastatic TNBC, the 
frequency of HER2-low was 32.0%. Neither in univariable nor in multivariable 
analysis HER2-low showed any influence on OS."
786,"Synthetic biology uses genetically encoded devices and circuits to implement 
novel complex functions in living cells and organisms. A hallmark of these 
genetic circuits is the interaction among their individual parts, according to 
predefined rules, to process cellular information and produce a circuit output 
or response. As the number of individual components in a genetic circuit 
increases, so does the number of interactions needed to achieve the correct 
behavior, and hence, a greater need to fine-tune the levels of expression of 
each component. Transcriptional promoters play a key regulatory role in genetic 
circuits, as they influence the levels of RNA and proteins produced. In 
multicellular organisms, such as plants, they can also determine developmental, 
spatial, and tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. The 35S promoter from 
the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV 35S) is widely used in plant biotechnology to 
direct high levels of gene expression in a variety of plant species. We produced 
a library of 21 variants of the CaMV 35S promoter by introducing all single 
nucleotide substitutions to the promoter's TATA box sequence. We then 
characterized the activity of all variants in homozygous transgenic plants and 
showed that some of these variants have lower activity than the wild type in 
plants. These promoter variants could be used to fine-tune the behavior of 
synthetic genetic circuits in plants."
787,"Organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) is a liver-specific transporter and plays an 
essential role in drug disposition and hepatic lipid metabolism. Therefore, 
inhibition of OCT1 may not only lead to drug-drug interactions but also 
represent a potential therapy for fatty liver diseases. In this study, we 
systematically investigated the inhibitory effect of 200 natural products on 
OCT1-mediated uptake of 4,4-dimethylaminostyryl-N-methylpyridinium (ASP+) and 
identified 10 potent OCT1 inhibitors. The selectivity of these inhibitors over 
OCT2 was evaluated using both in vitro uptake assays and in silico molecular 
docking analyses. Importantly, benzoylpaeoniflorin was identified as the most 
potent OCT1 inhibitor with the highest selectivity over OCT2. Additionally, 
benzoylpaeoniflorin prevented lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, with 
concomitant activation of AMPK and down-regulation of lipogenic genes, such as 
acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). To conclude, our 
findings are of significant value in understanding OCT1-based natural 
product-drug interactions and provide a natural source of OCT1 inhibitors which 
may hold promise for treating fatty liver diseases."
788,"INTRODUCTION: Autophagy is a highly conservative self-degradative process. It 
aims at elimination-impaired proteins and cellular organelles. Previous research 
confirmed the autophagy role in cancer pathogenesis.
AREAS COVERED: This article discusses the role of autophagy in the development 
of AML. Autophagy seems to be a 'double-sword' mechanism, hence, either its 
suppression or induction could promote neoplasm growth. This mechanism could 
also be the aim of the 'molecular targeted therapy'. Chemo- and radiotherapy 
induce cellular stress in neoplasm cells with subsequent autophagy suppression. 
Simultaneously, it is claimed that the autophagy suppression increases 
chemosensitivity 'in neoplastic cells. Some agents, like bortezomib, in turn 
could promote autophagy process, e.g., in AML (acute myeloid leukemia). However, 
currently there are not many studies focusing on the role of autophagy in 
patients suffering for AML. In this review, we summarize the research done so 
far on the role of autophagy in the development of AML.
EXPERT OPINION: The analysis of autophagy genes expression profiling in AML 
could be a relevant factor in the diagnostic process and treatment 
'individualization'. Autophagy modulation seems to be a relevant target in the 
oncological therapy - it could limit disease progression and increase the 
effectiveness of treatment."
789,"Recombination of biosynthetic gene clusters including those of non-ribosomal 
peptide synthetases (NRPSs) is essential for understanding the mechanisms of 
biosynthesis. Due to relatively huge gene cluster sizes ranging from 10 to 150 
kb, the prevalence of sequence repeats, and inability to clearly define optimal 
points for manipulation, functional characterization of recombinant NRPSs with 
maintained activity has been hindered. In this study, we introduce a simple yet 
rapid approach named ""Seamed Express Assembly Method (SEAM)"" coupled with 
Ordered Gene Assembly in Bacillus subtilis (OGAB) to reconstruct fully 
functional plipastatin NRPS. This approach is enabled by the introduction of 
restriction enzyme sites as seams at module borders. SEAM-OGAB is then first 
demonstrated by constructing the ppsABCDE NRPS (38.4 kb) to produce plipastatin, 
a cyclic decapeptide in B. subtilis. The introduced amino acid level seams do 
not hinder the NRPS function and enable successful production of plipastatin at 
a commensurable titer. It is challenging to modify the plipastatin NRPS gene 
cluster due to the presence of three long direct-repeat sequences; therefore, 
this study demonstrates that SEAM-OGAB can be readily applied towards the 
recombination of various NRPSs. Compared to previous NRPS gene assembly methods, 
the advantage of SEAM-OGAB is that it readily enables the shuffling of NRPS gene 
modules, and therefore, chimeric NRPSs can be rapidly constructed for the 
production of novel peptides. This chimeric assembly application of SEAM-OGAB is 
demonstrated by swapping plipastatin NRPS and surfactin NRPS modules to produce 
two novel lipopeptides in B. subtilis."
790,"The effects of water on the carboxylic acid ketonization reaction over solid 
Lewis-acid catalysts were examined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy 
(DRIFTS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and kinetic measurements. 
Acetic acid and propanoic acid were used as model compounds, and P25 TiO2 was 
used as a model catalyst to represent the anatase TiO2 since the rutile phase 
only contributes to <2.5% of the overall ketonization activity of P25 TiO2. The 
kinetic measurement showed that introducing H2O vapor in gaseous feed decreases 
the ketonization reaction rate by increasing the intrinsic activation barrier of 
gas-phase acetic acid on anatase TiO2. Quantitative TPD of acetic acid indicated 
that H2O does not compete with acetic acid for Lewis sites. Instead, as 
indicated by combined approaches of NMR and DRIFTS, H2O associates with the 
adsorbed acetate or acetic acid intermediates on the catalyst surface and alters 
their reactivities for the ketonization reaction. There are multiple species 
present on the anatase TiO2 surface upon carboxylic acid adsorption, including 
molecular carboxylic acid, monodentate carboxylate, and chelating/bridging 
bidentate carboxylates. The presence of H2O vapor increases the coverage of the 
less reactive bridging bidentate carboxylate associated with adsorbed H2O, 
leading to lower ketonization activity on hydrated anatase TiO2. Surface 
hydroxyl groups, which are consumed by interaction with carboxylic acid upon the 
formation of surface acetate species, do not impact the ketonization reaction."
791,"Pathogenic AGO1 variants have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, 
including autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, intellectual 
disability, and dysmorphic facial appearance. In mammalian models, defects in 
microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis are associated with congenital heart disease and 
dilated cardiomyopathy. We describe the case of a patient with partial anomalous 
pulmonary venous return, hypoplastic left lung, bilateral pulmonary 
sequestration, and dilated myocardiopathy. We identified a de novo pathogenic 
variant of AGO1, which encodes an Argonaute protein forming a gene-silencing 
complex with microRNAs. The patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy 
with no apparent cause at 3 years of age. She was started on enalapril and 
carvedilol, and her heart failure was well controlled. We expanded the 
AGO1-associated phenotype to include complex congenital cardiovascular anomaly 
and dilated cardiomyopathy in humans."
792,"The increased use of next-generation sequencing has expanded our understanding 
of the involvement and prevalence of mosaicism in genetic disorders. We describe 
a total of eleven cases: nine in which mosaic variants detected by genome 
sequencing (GS) and/or targeted gene panels (TGPs) were considered to be 
causative for the proband's phenotype, and two of apparent parental mosaicism. 
Variants were identified in the following genes: PHACTR1, SCN8A, KCNT1, CDKL5, 
NEXMIF, CUX1, TSC2, GABRB2, and SMARCB1. In addition, we identified one large 
duplication including three genes, UBE3A, GABRB3, and MAGEL2, and one large 
deletion including deletion of ARFGAP1, EEF1A2, CHRNA4, and KCNQ2. All patients 
were enrolled in the NYCKidSeq study, a research program studying the 
communication of genomic information in clinical care, as well as the clinical 
utility and diagnostic yield of GS for children with suspected genetic disorders 
in diverse populations in New York City. We observed variability in the 
correlation between reported variant allele fraction and the severity of the 
patient's phenotype, although we were not able to determine the mosaicism 
percentage in clinically relevant tissue(s). Although our study was not 
sufficiently powered to assess differences in mosaicism detection between the 
two testing modalities, we saw a trend toward better detection by GS as compared 
with TGP testing. This case series supports the importance of mosaicism in 
childhood-onset genetic conditions and informs guidelines for laboratory and 
clinical interpretation of mosaic variants detected by GS."
793,"It is urgent to develop more effective mRNA vaccines against the emerging severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants owing to the 
immune escape. Here, we constructed a novel mRNA delivery system [IC8/Mn lipid 
nanoparticles (IC8/Mn LNPs)]with high immunogenicity, via introducing a 
stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist [manganese (Mn)] based on a newly 
synthesized ionizable lipid (IC8). It was found that Mn can not only promote 
maturation of antigen-presenting cells via activating STING pathway but also 
improve mRNA expression by facilitating lysosomal escape for the first time. 
Subsequently, IC8/Mn LNPs loaded with mRNA encoding the Spike protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 Delta or Omicron variant (IC8/Mn@D or IC8/Mn@O) were prepared. Both 
mRNA vaccines induced substantial specific immunoglobulin G responses against 
Delta or Omicron. IC8/Mn@D displayed strong pseudovirus neutralization ability, 
T helper 1-biased immune responses, and good safety. It can be concluded that 
IC8/Mn LNPs have great potential for developing Mn-coordinated mRNA vaccines 
with robust immunogenicity and good safety."
794,"Epigenetic dysregulation of cell cycle is a hallmark of tumorigenesis in 
multiple cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nonetheless, the 
epigenetic mechanisms underlying the aberrant cell cycle signaling and 
therapeutic response remain unclear. Here, we used an epigenetics-focused CRISPR 
interference screen and identified ACTR5 (actin-related protein 5), a component 
of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, to be essential for HCC tumor 
progression. Suppression of ACTR5 activated CDKN2A expression, ablated 
CDK/E2F-driven cell cycle signaling, and attenuated HCC tumor growth. 
Furthermore, high-density CRISPR gene tiling scans revealed a distinct 
HCC-specific usage of ACTR5 and its interacting partner IES6 compared to the 
other INO80 complex members, suggesting an INO80-independent mechanism of 
ACTR5/IES6 in supporting the HCC proliferation. Last, our study revealed the 
synergism between ACTR5/IES6-targeting and pharmacological inhibition of CDK in 
treating HCC. These results indicate that the dynamic interplay between 
epigenetic regulators, tumor suppressors, and cell cycle machinery could provide 
novel opportunities for combinational HCC therapy."
795,"Translation control is essential in balancing hematopoietic precursors and 
differentiation; however, the mechanisms underlying this program are poorly 
understood. We found that the activity of the major cap-binding protein eIF4E is 
unexpectedly regulated in a dynamic manner throughout erythropoiesis that is 
uncoupled from global protein synthesis rates. Moreover, eIF4E activity directs 
erythroid maturation, and increased eIF4E expression maintains cells in an early 
erythroid state associated with a translation program driving the expression of 
PTPN6 and Igf2bp1. A cytosine-enriched motif in the 5' untranslated region is 
important for eIF4E-mediated translation specificity. Therefore, selective 
translation of key target genes necessary for the maintenance of early erythroid 
states by eIF4E highlights a unique mechanism used by hematopoietic precursors 
to rapidly elicit erythropoietic maturation upon need."
796,"In peripheral blood, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) contains circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA), which indicates molecular abnormalities in metastatic breast tumor 
tissue. The sequencing of cfDNA of Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) patients 
allows assessment of therapy response and noninvasive treatment. In the proposed 
study, clinically significant alterations in PIK3CA and TP53 genes associated 
with MBC resulting in a missense substitution of His1047Arg and Arg282Trp from 
an next-generation sequencing-based multi-gene panel were reported in a cfDNA of 
a patient with MBC. To investigate the impact of the reported mutation, we used 
molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, network analysis, and pathway 
analysis. Molecular Docking analysis determined the distinct binding pattern 
revealing H1047R-ATP complex has a higher number of Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and 
binding affinity with a slight difference compared to the PIK3CA-ATP complex. 
Following, molecular dynamics simulation for 200 ns, of which H1047R-ATP complex 
resulted in the instability of PIK3CA. Similarly, for TP53 mutant R282W, the 
zinc-free state (apo) and zinc-bounded (holo) complexes were investigated for 
conformational change between apo and holo complexes, of which the holo complex 
mutant R282W was unstable. To validate the conformational change of PIK3CA and 
TP53, 80% mutation of H1047R in the kinase domain of p110α expressed 
ubiquitously in PIK3CA protein that alters PI3K pathway, while R282W mutation in 
DNA binding helix (H2) region of P53 protein inhibits the transcription factor 
in P53 pathway causing MBC. According to our findings, the extrinsic (hypoxia, 
oxidative stress, and acidosis); intrinsic factors (MYC amplification) in PIK3CA 
and TP53 mutations will provide potential insights for developing novel 
therapeutic methods for MBC therapy."
797,"Trichoderma reesei was induced to produce cellulase by a combination of glucose 
and β-disaccharide; however, lower levels of auxiliary proteins for degrading 
lignocellulosic biomass were detected by iTRAQ analysis compared with cellulose 
as an inducer, especially cellulose induced protein 1 (CIP1). In this study, A 
pdc1 promoter-driven overexpression of the endogenous Trcip1 gene was observed 
in T. reesei Rut C30, and the Trcip1 transcription levels of the two 
transformants, T. reesei OE-cip1-1 and OE-cip1-2, demonstrated 31.2- and 
164.6-fold increases, respectively, but there was no significant change in 
cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase and filter paper activity at 48 h. The crude 
enzyme was then used to hydrolyze corn stover. For T. reesei OE-cip1-1 and 
OE-cip1-2, the hydrolysis efficiency increased by 25.0 and 28.6% with a solid 
loading of 5% at 2 h, respectively. Simultaneously, 85.5 and 85.2 g/L glucose 
were released using a cellulase cocktail at high solid loading (20%), and these 
glucose release rates were significantly greater than that of T. reesei Rut C30 
cellulase (77.4 g/L) at 120 h. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
and X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that the enhanced hydrolysis efficiency was 
primarily triggered by the decrease in the crystallinity of lignocellulose, and 
the fiber structure had varying degrees of loosening and disintegration."
798,"This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of static magnetic field (SMF) 
and nanoparticles (NPs) on the vitrification of cumulus-oocyte-complex (COC). To 
this end, the non-vitrified (nVit) and vitrified groups (Vit) that contain NPs, 
with or without SMF were labeled nVit_NPs, nVit_NPs_SMF, Vit_NPs, and 
Vit_NPs_SMF, respectively. The non-toxic dosages of NPs were first determined to 
be 0.008% w/v. The survival, apoptosis, and necrosis, mitochondrial activity, 
fertilization rate, subsequent-derived embryo development, and gene expressions 
were examined. The viability rates obtained by trypan blue and Anx-PI staining 
were meaningfully smaller in the Vit groups, compared to the nVit groups. The 
JC1 red/green signal ratios were reduced considerably in the Vit group, compared 
to the nVit. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed to assess the 
entry of the NPs into the oocytes. TEM images showed that NPs were present in 
nVit_NPs, and Vit_NPs. Thereafter, the effects of NPs and SMF on in vitro 
fertilization (IVF) were examined. The difference in blastocyst rates between 
nVit and Vit_NPs_SMF groups was significant. Finally, Nanog, Cdx2, Oct4, and 
Sox2 genes were evaluated. There were substantial differences in Cdx2 gene 
expressions between the Vit_NPs and nVit groups. The expression of Nanog in Vit 
was significantly higher than those of the Vit_NPs, Vit_NPs_SMF, and nVit 
groups. The data presented here provide deeper insight into the application of 
iron oxide nanoparticles in COC vitrification. It appears that using SMF and 
supplemented CPA by NPs inhibits cryoinjury and promote the embryo development 
capacity of vitrified-warmed COCs."
799,"Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (hamp) is active in teleosts against invading 
pathogens and plays important roles in the stress and immune responses of 
finfish. The response of hamp gene was studied in yellow perch (yp) (Perca 
flavescens) challenged with lipopolysaccharides to understand if this immunity 
response is sex-specifically different. The cloned hamp gene consists of an 
open-reading frame of 273 bp and encodes a deduced protein of 90 amino acids 
(a.a.), which includes a signal peptide of 24 a.a., a pro-domain of 40 a.a. and 
a mature peptide of 26 a.a. Yp hamp involves 8 cysteine residues with 4 
disulfide bonds, and a protein with an internal alpha helix flanked with C- and 
N-terminal random coils was modeling predicted. RT-qPCR was used to analyze the 
relative abundances (RAs) of hamp mRNA in the livers of juvenile female and male 
yellow perch challenged with lipopolysaccharide. The expression levels of hamp 
were significantly elevated by 3 h (RA = 7.3) and then peaked by 6 h (RA = 29.4) 
post-treatment in females but the peak was delayed to 12 h (RA = 65.4) 
post-treatment in males. The peak mRNA level of challenged males was shown 
7.6-fold higher than females. The post-treatment responses in both genders 
decreased to their lowest levels by 24 h and 48 h. Overall, female perch had an 
earlier but less-sensitive response to the lipopolysaccharide challenge than 
male."
800,"Infertility is experienced by 8%-12% of adults in their reproductive period 
globally and has become a prevalent concern. Besides routine therapeutic 
methods, stem cells are rapidly being examined as viable alternative therapies 
in regenerative medicine and translational investigation. Remarkable progress 
has been made in understanding the biology and purpose of stem cells. The 
affected pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are 
further studied for their possible use in reproductive medicine, particularly 
for infertility induced by premature ovarian insufficiency and azoospermia. 
Accordingly, this study discusses current developments in the use of some kinds 
of MSCs such as adipose-derived stem cells, bone marrow stromal cells, umbilical 
cord MSCs, and menstrual blood MSCs. These methods have been used to manage 
ovarian and uterine disorders, and each technique presents a novel method for 
the therapy of infertility."
801,"BACKGROUND: Anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury (AT-DILI) is one of the 
most common side effects in TB patients during treatment. The prime cause of 
liver injury during TB treatment is reported to be isoniazid and its 
metabolites. Different factors influenced the development of AT-DILI, and 
genetic factors are one of the major factors.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Polymorphisms in drug metabolism genes like NAT2, CYP2E1, 
PXR, and GST have been reported to be associated with AT-DILI, and they are one 
of the major areas of focus at present. Attempts are met in this review to 
analyse the different markers in these drug metabolism genes for their 
association with AT-DILI.
CONCLUSION: A better understanding of the polymorphisms in these genes and their 
functional effects will give better insights into the development of AT-DILI, 
and it could facilitate in designing and developing more effective personalized 
treatment for TB."
802,"BACKGROUND: Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis is an important medicinal plant, 
and the main active ingredient of the plant is polyphyllin, which is a steroid 
saponin with pharmacological activities. The central enzyme genes participating 
in the biosynthesis of polyphyllin are increasingly being uncovered; however, 
UGTs are rarely illustrated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, we cloned a new sterol glycosyltransferase 
from Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis and identified its catalytic function in 
vitro. PpUGT6 showed the ability to catalyse the C-3 glycosylation of pennogenin 
sapogenin of polyphyllin, and PpUGT6 showed catalytic promiscuity towards 
steroids at the C-17 position of testosterone and methyltestosterone and the 
triterpene at the C-3 position of glycyrrhetinic acid. Homology modelling of the 
PpUGT6 protein and virtual molecular docking of PpUGT6 with sugar acceptors and 
donors were performed, and we predicted the key residues interacting with 
ligands.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, PpUGT6, a novel sterol glycosyltransferase related to the 
biosynthesis of polyphyllin from P. polyphylla, was characterized. PpUGT6 
catalysed C-3 glycosylation to pennogenin sapogenin of polyphyllin, which is the 
first glycosylation step of the biosynthetic pathway of polyphyllins. 
Interestingly, PpUGT6 demonstrated glycodiversification to testosterone and 
methyltestosterone at C-17 and triterpene of glycyrrhetinic acid at the C-3 
position. The virtual molecular docking of PpUGT6 protein with ligands predicted 
the key residues interacting with them. This work characterized a novel SGT 
glycosylating pennogenin sapogenin at C-3 of polyphyllin from P. polyphylla and 
provided a reference for further elucidation of the phytosterol 
glycosyltransferases in catalytic promiscuity and key residues interacting with 
substrates."
803,"Recently, nucleic acid drugs have been considered as promising candidates in 
treatment of various diseases, especially cancer. Because of developing 
resistance to conventional chemotherapy, use of genetic tools in cancer therapy 
appears inevitable. siRNA is a RNAi tool with capacity of suppressing target 
gene. Owing to overexpression of oncogenic factors in cancer, siRNA can be used 
for suppressing those pathways. This review emphasizes the function of siRNA in 
treatment of breast tumor. The anti-apoptotic-related genes including Bcl-2, 
Bcl-xL and survivin can be down-regulated by siRNA in triggering cell death in 
breast cancer. STAT3, STAT8, Notch1, E2F3 and NF-κB are among the factors with 
overexpression in breast cancer that their silencing by siRNA paves the way for 
impairing tumor proliferation and invasion. The oncogenic mechanisms in drug 
resistance development in breast tumor such as lncRNAs can be suppressed by 
siRNA. Furthermore, siRNA reducing P-gp activity can increase drug 
internalization in tumor cells. Because of siRNA degradation at bloodstream and 
low accumulation at tumor site, nanoplatforms have been employed for siRNA 
delivery to suppress breast tumor progression via improving siRNA efficacy in 
gene silencing. Development of biocompatible and efficient nanostructures for 
siRNA delivery can make milestone progress in alleviation of breast cancer 
patients."
804,"Slowing aging can reduce the risk of chronic diseases. In particular, 
eliminating senescent cells is a promising approach to slow aging. Previous 
studies found that both cells from older animals and senescent cells have noisy 
gene expression. Here, we performed a large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing 
time course to understand how transcriptional heterogeneity develops among 
senescent cells. We found that cells experiencing senescence-inducing oxidative 
stress rapidly adopt one of two major transcriptional states. One senescent cell 
state is associated with stress response, and the other is associated with 
tissue remodeling. We did not observe increased stochastic gene expression. This 
data is consistent with the idea that reproducible, limited, distinct, and 
coherent transcriptional states exist in senescent cell populations. These 
physiologically distinct senescent cell subtypes may each affect the aging 
process in unique ways and constitute a source of heterogeneity in aging."
805,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that destroys 
joint cartilage and causes disability. Synovial inflammation, with angiogenesis, 
is an early event in the progression of the disease. Angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) is 
a cytokine with both inflammatory and angiogenic effects. Many genes can 
influence RA susceptibility and disease activity. The aim is to assess the 
relationship between ANGPT2 gene polymorphism (rs3020221) and RA. The study was 
a case-control study that included 212 RA patients and 238 age-and 
gender-matched healthy volunteers. RA disease activity was assessed using the 
Disease Activity Score 28 index. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive 
protein, rheumatoid factor, and antibody to cyclic citrullinated peptide were 
measured. ANGPT2 rs3020221 C > T SNP genotyping was done using real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The TT genotype was more frequently represented 
in RA patients than in healthy controls (18.9% and 7.1%, respectively, p < 
0.001) and increased the chance of developing RA four-fold, as compared to other 
genotypes (OR = 4.00, 95% CI = 2.09-7.63) (p < 0.001). The CT genotype was 
associated with elevated levels of the inflammatory markers ESR and CRP in RA 
patients (p = 0.012 and 0.037, respectively) as well as the DAS28 ESR Score (p < 
0.001). The presence of the T allele either under the dominant model (for 
genotypes CT and TT) or the recessive model (for the genotype TT) predicts RA 
disease. Assessment of ANGPT2 gene polymorphism is useful to predict the 
patients with susceptibility to RA. The presence of T allele increased the risk 
of developing RA disease by two folds."
806,"This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of bovine gammaherpesvirus 4 
(BoHV-4) among healthy cattle and buffaloes as well as those associated with 
different diseases (respiratory tract infection, mastitis and reproductive tract 
infection) in District Chakwal, Pakistan. Blood, swab and milk samples of cattle 
and buffaloes were randomly collected from different areas of Chakwal. DNA was 
isolated from the samples and subjected to nested PCR using thymidine kinase 
gene primers. Out of 300 samples (200 blood, 50 swab and 50 milk samples) from 
both species (cattle and buffalo), an overall prevalence of BoHV-4 of 3.33% was 
obtained. Samples from cattle showed a higher species-specific prevalence 
(4.16%) than samples from buffalo (2.78%). One sample out of 50 swab samples and 
1 out of 50 milk samples were also positive for BoHV-4. DNA sequencing of a 
positive PCR product from cattle confirmed that the sequence was from the 
thymidine kinase gene of BoHV-4. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed close 
similarities with other BOHV-4 thymidine kinase sequences. To detect BoHV-4 
antibodies, an indirect ELISA was also performed. Two hundred blood samples were 
also collected from the same animals in nonanticoagulant-containing tubes for 
the isolation of serum and were subjected to indirect ELISA. Sixteen samples 
(8%) were positive for BoHV-4 antibodies. This study will be useful in further 
diagnoses of BoHV-4 in Pakistan and in devising measures to control the spread 
of BoHV-4."
807,"As the most prevalent brain tumor, glioma is malignant with poor prognostic 
outcomes. As a result, it is of great importance to detect biomarkers for glioma 
diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we determined grade-based characteristic 
gene clusters with gradual expression following grade change, including 1479 
down- and 526 up-regulated genes. Combined interaction among proteins 
originating from these genes was analyzed, and hub genes were exhibited after 
GSEA enrichment, containing 12 and 11 genes which were correlated with 
prognostic outcomes, named as unfavorable and favorable gene sets, respectively. 
The GSVA score of each gene set was calculated and divided into high/low groups; 
we observed that cases in the low score group had better outcomes than the high 
score group based on the GSVA of the unfavorable set, while with favorable GSVA 
score, the low group had poorer outcomes than the high group. Eventually, we 
compared a variety of infiltrating immune cells between low/high GSVA subgroup, 
showing various immune cell types (B cell naive, activated mast cells, resting 
CD4 memory T cell, and so on) with opposite proportion. And interestingly, these 
cell types also accounted for a contrary percentage between unfavorable and 
favorable conditions. In conclusion, these two hub gene sets are of good 
importance as an evaluation system for clinical grade classification and 
prognosis prediction."
808,"Annelid chaetae are extracellular chitinous structures that are formed in an 
extracellular epidermal invagination, the chaetal follicle. The basalmost cell 
of this follicle, the chaetoblast, serves like a 3D-printer as it dynamically 
shapes the chaeta. During chaetogenesis apical microvilli of the chaetoblast 
form the template for the chaeta, any structural details result from modulating 
the microvilli pattern. This study describes this process in detail in the model 
organism Platynereis dumerilii and clarifies some aspects of chaetogenesis in 
its close relative Nereis vexillosa, the first annelid in which the 
ultrastructure of chaetogenesis had been described. Nereid species possess 
compound chaetae characteristic for numerous subgroups of errant annelids. The 
distal most section of these chaetae is movable; a hinge connects this part of 
the chaeta to the shaft. Modulation of the microvilli and differences in their 
structure, diameter and number of microvilli, and their withdrawal and 
reappearance determine the shape of these compound chaetae. Chaetal structure 
and pattern also change during life history. While larvae possess a single type 
of chaeta (in addition to internal aciculae), juveniles and adults possess two 
types of chaetae that are replaced by large paddle-shaped chaetae in swimming 
epitokous stages. Chaetogenesis is a continuous process that lasts during the 
entire lifespan. The detailed developmental sequence of chaetae and their site 
of formation are very similar within species and species groups. We expect that 
similarity results from a conserved gene regulatory network making this an 
optimal system to test the phylogenetic affinity of taxa and the homology of 
their chaetae."
809,"Orf virus (ORFV) causes an acute, contagious, skin disease of sheep and goats 
which is economically important. The objectives of this study were to identify 
ORFV and to explore its pathological and phylogenetic profiles in 350 goats and 
91 sheep of 14 districts of Punjab, Pakistan, from July 2020 to July 2021. Skin 
scrapings (total no. of samples = 441) of suspected animals were subjected to 
polymerase chain reactions, phylogenetic analysis, and pathological 
observations. The partial length of GIF/IL-2 gene (408 bp) was successfully 
amplified in 58/441 samples. Phylogenetic analysis of GIF/IL2 gene showed that 
the study isolates belonged to ORFV-cluster I, together with the viruses 
reported in India and China. Pakistan ORFV isolates were shared 97.6-98.7% 
nucleotide and 97.6-100% amino acid identities with the reference strain 
(NC_005336). Moreover, Chinese ORFV-isolates were detected unique multiple amino 
acid substitutions (F11L, Q21H, D27N, I46V, N49S, N82D, D103N, S129G) with study 
isolates. Naturally infected animals were anorexic, emaciated, dull, and 
depressed. The macroscopic lesions included multifocal to coalescing, ulceration 
followed by proliferative papules, pustules, and crust formation on the 
epidermis of gums, lips, mouth commissure, muzzles, nose, and udder. 
Histopathological examination revealed hyperplasia, anastomosing rete ridges 
formation and degenerative changes, including spongiosis and vacuolation of 
epidermal cells. Keratinocytes exhibited eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion 
bodies with pyknotic and karyorrhexis nuclei. This is the first report on 
molecular characterization of ORFV from Pakistan, with insight into its 
pathogenesis and comparative analysis of pathological alterations and genetic 
diversity between ORFV strains reported in different geographical areas."
810,"Plant cuticular wax was a major consideration affecting the growth and quality 
of plants through protecting the plant from drought and other diseases. 
According to existing studies, CER1, as the core enzyme encoding the synthesis 
of alkanes, the main component of wax, can directly affect the response of 
plants to stress. However, there were few studies on the related functions of 
CER1 in apple. In this study, three MdCER1 genes in Malus domestica were 
identified and named MdCER1-1, MdCER1-2, and MdCER1-3 according to their 
distribution on chromosomes. Then, their physicochemical properties, sequence 
characteristics, and expression patterns were analyzed. MdCER1-1, with the 
highest expression level among the three members, was screened for cloning and 
functional verification. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) 
analysis also showed that drought stress could increase the expression level of 
MdCER1-1. The experiment of water loss showed that overexpression of MdCER1-1 
could effectively prevent water loss in apple calli, and the effect was more 
significant under drought stress. Meanwhile, MdYPB5, MdCER3, and MdKCS1 were 
significantly up-regulated, which would be bound up with waxy metabolism. Gas 
chromatography-mass spectrometer assay of wax fraction makes known that 
overexpression of MdCER1-1 apparently scaled up capacity of alkanes. The enzyme 
activities (SOD, POD) of overexpressed apple calli increased significantly, 
while the contents of proline increased compared with wild-type calli. In 
conclusion, MdCER1-1 can resist drought stress by reducing water loss in apple 
calli epidermis, increasing alkanes component content, stimulating the 
expression of waxy related genes (MdYPB5, MdCER3, and MdKCS1), and increasing 
antioxidant enzyme activity, which also provided a theoretical basis for 
exploring the role of waxy in other stresses."
811,"Wheat is one of the most important food sources on Earth. MicroRNAs (miRNA) play 
important roles in wheat productivity. To identify wheat miRNAs, we constructed 
and sequenced sRNA libraries from leaves and roots of two wheat cultivars 
(RAC875 and Kukri) with many different traits. Given that available miRNA wheat 
complement in the plant-specific database PmiREN ( https://pmiren.com ) does not 
include root tissues and root-associated miRNAs might thus be missing, we 
performed first the prediction of novel miRNAs using the sRNAbench tool. We 
found a total of 150 putatively novel miRNA genes with expression of both arms 
from 289 unique mature sequences and nearly 30% of all miRNA reads in roots 
corresponded to novel miRNAs. In contrast, this figure in leaves dropped to 
under 3%, confirming the undersampling of roots in the complement of known 
miRNAs. By using 120 publicly available wheat datasets, 598 Zea mays small RNA 
libraries, 64 plant species genomes, wheat degradome library, and functional 
enrichment analysis, a subset of novel miRNAs were confirmed as bona-fide 
miRNAs. Of the total 605 miRNAs identified in this study inclusive of 316 known 
miRNAs, 528 miRNAs were shared by both cultivars, 429 miRNAs were shared by both 
root tissues and 329 miRNAs were shared by both leaf tissues. In addition, 32 
miRNAs were specific to Kukri while 45 miRNAs were specific to RAC875. These 
miRNAs had diverse functions, such as regulation of gene transcription, protein 
translation, energy metabolism, and cell cycle progression. Our data provide a 
genome-wide miRNA expression profile in these two wheat cultivars and help 
functional studies of wheat genomics."
812,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the deadliest form of urological cancer and is 
projected to be the fourth most common neoplasm in the USA in males by 2040. In 
addition to the current poor prognosis with 5-year survival rates hardly 
reaching 15%, the prevalence of resistance to currently available systemic 
therapies has also established an urgent need to develop new treatment 
regimen(s) for advanced RCC. Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is the first 
identified ubiquitin-like modifier and has been intensively studied for its 
central role in innate immunity against intracellular pathogens. However, in 
this study, we identified ISG15 as a novel tumor-associated antigen and 
prognostic marker in RCC. Further, we therapeutically targeted elevated ISG15 
expression by means of a Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)-based vaccine, designated 
Lm-LLO-ISG15, in both subcutaneous and orthotopic RCC mouse models. Treatment 
with Lm-LLO-ISG15 resulted in an influx of tumor-infiltrating effector T cells 
and significant anti-tumor efficacy in both subcutaneous and orthotopic RCC 
tumor models. Treatment with Lm-LLO-ISG15 also generated a robust 
interferon-gamma response and attracted a larger pool of polyfunctional T cells 
into the tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the therapeutic efficacy of 
Lm-LLO-ISG15 in RCC is comparable to that of anti-PD-1 and sunitinib, the 
current frontline therapies for RCC patients. Collectively, our work illustrates 
that targeting ISG15 in RCC with a CTL-based immunotherapy such as Lm-LLO-ISG15 
is a promising and potentially translatable therapeutic strategy to enhance 
survival in RCC patients."
813,"Pantoea bacteria species cause human animal infections, and contribute to soil 
and aquatic environmental pollution. A novel bacteriophage, vB_Pd_C23 was 
isolated from a Tunisian wastewater system and represents the first new phage 
infecting P. dispersa. Lysis kinetics, electron microscopy, and genomic analyses 
revealed that the vB_Pd_C23 phage has a head diameter of 50 nm and contractile 
tail dimensions of 100 nm by 23 nm; vB_Pd_C23 has a linear double-stranded DNA 
genome consisting of 44,714-bp and 49.66% GC-content. Predicted functions were 
assigned to 75 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding proteins and one tRNA, the 
annotation revealed that 21 ORFs encode for unique proteins of yet unknown 
function with no reliable homologies. This indicates that the new species 
vB_Pd_C23 exhibits novel viral genes. Phylogenetic analysis along with 
comparative analyses generating nucleotide identity and similarity of vB_Pd_C23 
whole genome suggests that the phage is a candidate for a new genus within the 
Caudoviricetes Class. The characteristics of this phage could not be attributed 
to any previous genera recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of 
Viruses (ICTV)."
814,"BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer (BCa) has a high incidence and recurrence rate 
worldwide. So far, there is no noninvasive detection of BCa therapy and 
prognosis based on urine multi-omics. Therefore, it is necessary to explore 
noninvasive predictive models and novel treatment modalities for BCa.
METHODS: First, we performed protein analysis of urine from five BCa patients 
and five healthy individuals using liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Combining multi-omics data to mine particular and 
sensitive molecules to predict BCa prognosis. Second, urine proteomics data were 
combined with TCGA transcriptome data to select differential genes that were 
specifically highly expressed in urine and tissues. Further, the Lasso equation 
was used to screen specific molecules to construct a noninvasive prediction 
model of BCa. Finally, natural compounds of specific molecules were selected by 
combined network pharmacology and molecular docking to complete molecular 
structure docking.
RESULTS: A noninvasive predictive model was constructed using PSMB5, P4HB, 
S100A16, GET3, CNP, TFRC, DCXR, and MPZL1, specific molecules screened by 
multi-omics, and clinical features, which had good predictive value at 1, 3, and 
5 years of prediction. High expression of these target genes suggests a poor 
prognosis in patients with BCa, and they were mainly involved in cell adhesion 
molecules and the IGF pathway. In addition, the corresponding drugs and natural 
compounds were selected by network pharmacology, and the molecular structure 
7NHT of PSMB5 was found to be well docked to Ellagic acid, a natural compound in 
Hetaoren that we found. The 3D structure 6I7S of P4HB was able to bind to 
Stigmasterol in Shanzha stably, and the structure 6WRV of TFRC as an iron 
transport carrier was also able to bind to Stigmasterol in Shanzha stably. The 
structures 1WOJ, 3D3W, and 6IGW of CNP, DCXR, and MPZL1 can also play an 
important role in combination with the natural compounds (S)-Stylopine, 
Kryptoxanthin, and Sitosterol in Maqianzi, Yumixu, and Laoguancao.
CONCLUSION: The noninvasive prediction model based on urinomics had excellent 
potential in predicting the prognosis of patients with BCa. The multi-omics 
screening of specific molecules combined with pharmacology and compound 
molecular docking can promote the research and development of novel drugs."
815,"Photoperiod plays a critical role in controlling the formation of sexual or 
vegetative reproductive organs in potato. Although StPHYF-silenced plants 
overcome day-length limitations to tuberize through a systemic effect on 
tuberigen StSP6A expression in the stolon, the comprehensive regulatory network 
of StPHYF remains obscure. Therefore, the present study investigated the 
transcriptomes of StPHYF-silenced plants and observed that, in addition to known 
components of the photoperiodic tuberization pathway, florigen StSP3D and other 
flowering-related genes were activated in StPHYF-silenced plants, exhibiting an 
early flowering response. Additionally, grafting experiments uncovered the 
long-distance effect of StPHYF silencing on gene expression in the stolon, 
including the circadian clock components, flowering-associated MADSs, and 
tuberization-related regulatory genes. Similar to the AtFT-AtAP1 regulatory 
module in Arabidopsis, the present study established that the AP1-like StMADS1 
functions downstream of the tuberigen activation complex (TAC) and that 
suppressing StMADS1 inhibits tuberization in vitro and delays tuberization 
in vivo. Moreover, the expression of StSP6A was downregulated in 
StMADS1-silenced plants, implying the expression of StSP6A may be 
feedback-regulated by StMADS1. Overall, these results reveal that the regulatory 
network of StPHYF controls flowering and tuberization and targets the crucial 
tuberization factor StMADS1 through TAC, thereby providing a better 
understanding of StPHYF-mediated day-length perception during potato 
reproduction."
816,"Rare and geographically restricted species may be vulnerable to genetic effects 
from inbreeding depression in small populations or from genetic swamping through 
hybridization with common species, but a third possibility is that selective 
gene flow can restore fitness (genetic rescue). Climate-sensitive pikas 
(Ochotona spp.) of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QHTP) and its vicinity have been 
reduced to residual populations through the movement of climatic zones during 
the Pleistocene and recent anthropogenic disturbance, while the plateau pika (O. 
curzoniae) remains common. Population-level whole-genome sequencing (n = 142) of 
six closely related species in the subgenus Ochotona revealed several phases of 
ancient introgression, lineage replacement, and bidirectional introgression. The 
strength of gene flow was greatest from the dominant O. curzoniae to 
ecologically distinct species in areas peripheral to the QHTP. Genetic analyses 
were consistent with environmental reconstructions of past population movements. 
Recurrent periods of introgression throughout the Pleistocene revealed an 
increase in genetic variation at first but subsequent loss of genetic variation 
in later phases. Enhanced dispersion of introgressed genomic regions apparently 
contributed to demographic recovery in three peripheral species that underwent 
range shifts following climate oscillations on the QHTP, although it failed to 
drive recovery of northeastern O. dauurica and geographically isolated O. 
sikimaria. Our findings highlight differences in timescale and environmental 
background to determine the consequence of hybridization and the unique role of 
the QHTP in conserving key evolutionary processes of sky island species."
817,"Five versions of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii reference genome have been 
produced over the last two decades. Here we present version 6, bringing 
significant advances in assembly quality and structural annotations. 
PacBio-based chromosome-level assemblies for two laboratory strains, CC-503 and 
CC-4532, provide resources for the plus and minus mating type alleles. We 
corrected major misassemblies in previous versions and validated our assemblies 
via linkage analyses. Contiguity increased over ten-fold and >80% of filled gaps 
are within genes. We used Iso-Seq and deep RNA-seq datasets to improve 
structural annotations, and updated gene symbols and textual annotation of 
functionally characterized genes via extensive manual curation. We discovered 
that the cell wall-less classical reference strain CC-503 exhibits genomic 
instability potentially caused by deletion of the helicase RECQ3, with major 
structural mutations identified that affect >100 genes. We therefore present the 
CC-4532 assembly as the primary reference, although this strain also carries 
unique structural mutations and is experiencing rapid proliferation of a Gypsy 
retrotransposon. We expect all laboratory strains to harbor gene-disrupting 
mutations, which should be considered when interpreting and comparing 
experimental results. Collectively, the resources presented here herald a new 
era of Chlamydomonas genomics and will provide the foundation for continued 
research in this important reference organism."
818,"Transcriptional enhanced associate domains (TEADs) are transcription factors 
that bind to cotranscriptional activators like the yes-associated protein (YAP) 
or its paralog transcriptional coactivator with a PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). 
TEAD·YAP/TAZ target genes are involved in tissue and immune homeostasis, organ 
size control, tumor growth, and metastasis. Here, we report isoindoline and 
octahydroisoindole small molecules with a cyanamide electrophile that forms a 
covalent bond with a conserved cysteine in the TEAD palmitate-binding cavity. 
Time- and concentration-dependent studies against TEAD1-4 yielded second-order 
rate constants kinact/KI greater than 100 M-1 s-1. Compounds inhibited YAP1 
binding to TEADs with submicromolar IC50 values. Cocrystal structures with TEAD2 
enabled structure-activity relationship studies. In mammalian cells, compounds 
suppressed CTGF mRNA levels and inhibited TEAD1-4 transcriptional activity with 
submicromolar IC50 values. Inhibition of TEAD binding to YAP1 in mammalian cells 
was also observed. Several compounds inhibited the cell viability of sarcoma, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, and breast cancer cells with 
single-digit micromolar IC50 values."
819,"Intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins has increased advantages over 
current small-molecule drugs and gene therapies, especially in therapeutic 
efficacies for a broad spectrum of diseases. Hence, developing the protein 
therapeutics approach provides a needed alternative. Here, we designed a 
mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-mediated protein delivery approach and 
demonstrated effective intracellular delivery of the denatured superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) protein, overcoming the delivery challenges and achieving higher 
enzymatic activity than native SOD-conjugated MSNs. The denatured SOD-conjugated 
MSN delivery strategy provides benefits of reduced size and steric hindrance, 
increased protein flexibility without distorting its secondary structure, 
exposure of the cell-penetrating peptide transactivator of transcription for 
enhanced efficient delivery, and a change in the corona protein composition, 
enabling cytosolic delivery. After delivery, SOD displayed a specific activity 
around threefold higher than in our previous reports. Furthermore, the in vivo 
biosafety and therapeutic potential for neuron therapy were evaluated, 
demonstrating the biocompatibility and the effective antioxidant effect in 
Neuro-2a cells that protected neurite outgrowth from paraquat-induced reactive 
oxygen species attack. This study offers an opportunity to realize the druggable 
possibility of cytosolic proteins using MSNs."
820,"Fibrosis is an important pathological process in the development of 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and the activation of hepatic stellate 
cell (HSC) is a central event in liver fibrosis. However, the transcriptomic 
change of activated HSCs (aHSCs) and resting HSCs (rHSCs) in NASH patients has 
not been assessed. This study aimed to identify transcriptomic signature of HSCs 
during the development of NASH and the underlying key functional pathways. 
NASH-associated transcriptomic change of HSCs was defined by single cell 
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, and those top up-regulated genes were 
identified as NASH-associated transcriptomic signatures. Those functional 
pathways involved in the NASH-associated transcriptomic change of aHSCs were 
explored by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and functional 
enrichment analyses. Key regulators were explored by upstream regulator analysis 
and transcription factor enrichment analysis. scRNA-seq analysis identified 
numerous differentially expressed genes in both rHSCs and aHSCs between NASH 
patients and healthy controls. Both scRNA-seq analysis and in-vivo experiments 
showed the existence of rHSCs (mainly expressing a-SMA) in the normal liver and 
the increased aHSCs (mainly expressing Collagen 1) in the fibrosis liver 
tissues. NASH-associated transcriptomic signature of rHSC (NASHrHSCsignature) 
and NASH-associated transcriptomic signature of aHSC (NASHaHSCsignature) were 
identified. WGCNA revealed the main pathways correlated with transcriptomic 
change of aHSCs. Several key upstream regulators and transcription factors of 
determining the functional change of aHSCs in NASH were identified. This study 
developed a useful transcriptomic signature with the potential in assessing the 
fibrosis severity in the development of NASH. This study also identified the 
main pathways in the activation of HSCs during the development of NASH."
821,"OBJECTIVE: Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive tubulopathy 
resulting from inactivating mutations in the SLC12A3 gene that encodes the 
thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC). To date, more than 500 
mutations have been identified in the SLC12A3 gene. In this study, we identified 
two new mutations in the SLC12A3 gene in two Chinese GS pedigrees.
DESIGN, PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: The clinical characteristics and laboratory 
examination of two suspected GS patients in our hospital were analyzed. In 
addition, two pedigrees including 11 members and 2 patients underwent SLC12A3 
gene analysis.
RESULTS: Both patients were middle-aged women with characteristics of 
hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, low level of urinary calcium 
and the elevated levels of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. So, they were 
clinically diagnosed as GS. Patient 2 also had type 2 diabetes and 
Graves' disease. Both patients were found to carry two mutations of SLC12A3 gene 
by Sanger direct sequencing, which were all compound heterozygous mutations. We 
identified three mutations in these two Chinese GS pedigrees, one of which was 
c.179C>T (Thr60Met). The novel c.2159G>T (p. Gly720Val) and c.2675T>C (p. 
Leu892Pro) mutations were strongly predicted to be pathogenic using four network 
programs-Polyphen-2, SIFT, Mutation Taster and LRT.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified two novel SLC12A3 genetic variant [c.2159G>T 
(p.Gly720Val) and c.2675T>C (p.Leu892Pro)] in two Chinese GS pedigrees. The 
discovery of new mutations has enriched the spectrum of SLC12A3 genotypes."
822,"The high accumulation of galloylated flavan-3-ols in Camellia sp. is a 
noteworthy phenomenon. We identified a flavan-3-ol galloylation-related 
functional gene cluster in tannin-rich plant Camellia sp., which included 
UGT84A22 and SCPL-AT gene clusters. We investigated the possible correlation 
between the accumulation of metabolites and the expression of SCPL-ATs and 
UGT84A22. The results revealed that C. sinensis, C. ptilophylla, and C. oleifera 
accumulated galloylated cis-flavan-3-ols (EGCG), galloylated trans-flavan-3-ols 
(GCG), and hydrolyzed tannins, respectively; however, C. nitidissima did not 
accumulate any galloylated compounds. C. nitidissima exhibited no expression of 
SCPL-AT or UGT84A22, whereas the other three species of Camellia exhibited 
various expression patterns. This indicated that the functions of the paralogs 
of SCPL-AT vary. Enzymatic analysis revealed that SCPL5 was neofunctionalized as 
a noncatalytic chaperone paralog, a type of chaerone-like protein, associating 
with flavan-3-ol galloylation; moreover, CsSCPL4 was subfunctionalized in 
association with the galloylation of cis- and trans-flavan-3-ols. In C. 
nitidissima, an SCPL4 homolog was noted with mutations in two cysteine residues 
forming a disulfide bond, which suggested that this homolog was 
defunctionalized. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the 
functional diversification of SCPL paralogs in Camellia sp."
823,"The analysis of whole genomes of pan-cancer data sets provides a challenge for 
researchers, and we contribute to the literature concerning the identification 
of robust subgroups with clear biological interpretation. Specifically, we 
tackle this unsupervised problem via a novel rank-based Bayesian clustering 
method. The advantages of our method are: the integration and quantification of 
all uncertainties related to both the input data and the model; the 
probabilistic interpretation of final results to allow straightforward 
assessment of the stability of clusters leading to reliable conclusions; and the 
transparent biological interpretation of the identified clusters, since each 
cluster is characterized by its top-ranked genomic features. We applied our 
method to RNA-seq data from cancer samples from 12 tumor types from The Cancer 
Genome Atlas. We identified a robust clustering that mostly reflects tissue of 
origin, but also includes pan-cancer clusters. Importantly, we identified three 
pan-squamous clusters composed of a mix of lung squamous cell carcinoma, head 
and neck squamous carcinoma and bladder cancer, with different biological 
functions over-represented in the top genes that characterize the three 
clusters. We also found two novel subtypes of kidney cancer that show different 
prognosis, and we reproduced known subtypes of breast cancer. Taken together, 
our method allows identification of robust and biologically meaningful clusters 
of pan-cancer samples."
824,"We investigated SNPs in alternative oxidase (AOX) genes and their connection to 
ecotype origins (climate, altitude and rainfall) by using genomic data sets of 
Arabidopsis and rice populations from 1190 and 90 ecotypes, respectively. 
Parameters were defined to detect non-synonymous SNPs in the AOX ORF, which 
revealed amino acid (AA) changes in AOX1c, AOX1d and AOX2 from Arabidopsis and 
AOX1c from rice in comparison to AOX references from Columbia-0 and Japonica 
ecotypes, respectively. Among these AA changes, Arabidopsis AOX1c_A161E&G165R 
and AOX1c_R242S revealed a link to high rainfall and high altitude, 
respectively, while all other changes in Arabidopsis and rice AOX were connected 
to high altitude and rainfall. Comparative 3D modeling showed that all mutant 
AOX presented structural differences in relation to the respective references. 
Molecular docking analysis uncovered lower binding affinity values between AOX 
and the substrate ubiquinol for most of the identified structures compared to 
their reference, indicating better enzyme-substrate binding affinities. Thus, 
our in silico data suggest that the majority of the AA changes found in the 
available ecotypes will confer better enzyme-subtract interactions and thus 
indicate environment-related, more efficient AOX activity. This article is

825,"In vivo, cells collectively migrate in a variety of developmental and 
pathological contexts. Coordinated epithelial rotation represents a unique type 
of collective cell migrations, which has been modeled in vitro under spatially 
confined conditions. Although it is known that the coordinated rotation depends 
on intercellular interactions, the contribution of E-cadherin, a major cell-cell 
adhesion molecule, has not been directly addressed on two-dimensional (2D) 
confined substrates. Here, using well-controlled fibronectin-coated surfaces, we 
tracked and compared the migratory behaviors of MDCK cells expressing or lacking 
E-cadherin. We observed that wild-type MDCK II cells exhibited persistent and 
coordinated rotations on discoidal patterns, while E-cadherin knockout cells 
migrated in a less coordinated manner without large-scale rotation. Our 
comparison of the collective dynamics between these two cell types revealed a 
series of changes in migratory behavior caused by the loss of E-cadherin, 
including a decreased global migration speed, less regularity in quantified 
coordination and increased average density of topological defects. Taken 
together, these data demonstrate that spontaneous initiation of collective 
epithelial rotations depends on E-cadherin under 2D discoidal confinements. This

826,"BACKGROUND: Anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) is an uncommon malignancy with a 
rising incidence that has a high cure rate in its early stages. There is an 
unmet need for a reliable method to monitor response to treatment and assist in 
surveillance. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing has shown great promise in 
other solid tumors for monitoring disease progression and detecting relapse in 
real time. This study aimed to determine the feasibility and use of personalized 
and tumor-informed ctDNA testing in SCCA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed real-world data from 251 patients (817 plasma 
samples) with stages I-IV SCCA, collected between 11/5/19 and 5/31/22. The tumor 
genomic landscape and feasibility of ctDNA testing was examined for all 
patients. The prognostic value of longitudinal ctDNA testing was assessed in 
patients with clinical follow-up (N = 37).
RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed PIK3CA as the most commonly 
mutated gene, and no associations between mutations and stage. Anytime ctDNA 
positivity and higher ctDNA levels (MTM/mL) were associated with metastatic 
disease (P = .004). For 37 patients with clinical follow-up, median follow-up 
time was 21.0 months (range: 4.1-67.3) post-diagnosis. For patients with stages 
I-III disease, anytime ctDNA-positivity after definitive treatment was 
associated with reduced DFS (HR: 28.0; P = .005).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of personalized and 
tumor-informed ctDNA testing as an adjunctive tool in patients with SCCA as well 
as potential use for detection of molecular/minuteimal residual disease, and 
relapse during surveillance. Prospective studies are needed to better evaluate 
the use of ctDNA testing in this indication."
827,"We present the case of a 38-year-old woman who, in the context of a 22-week 
gestation, was diagnosed with diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma. The age of the 
patient and the way in which the cancer presented itself, make genetic 
counseling mandatory to rule out hereditary diffuse gastric carcinoma syndrome. 
This rare entity, of autosomal dominant inheritance and closely linked to 
mutations in the CDH1 (in most cases) and CTNNA1 genes, is associated with a 
greater predisposition to develop malignant neoplasms of the breast and stomach. 
Genetic sequencing ruled out hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome. 
Unfortunately, 24 months after the cesarean section, our patient dies."
828,"Self-assembled DNA nanocages are among the most promising candidates for 
bioimaging and payload delivery into cells. DNA nanocages have great potential 
to efficiently address drug resistance and nucleic acid delivery problems due to 
precise control of their shape and size, and excellent biocompatibility. 
Although DNA nanostructures demonstrate some cellular uptake, because they bear 
a highly negative charge, the uptake of tetrahedral nanostructures is hindered 
by electrostatic repulsion. In this study, we describe a method to enhance the 
cellular uptake of DNA nanostructures using a binary system containing DNA and a 
positively charged head group with a hydrophobic lipid chain containing lipids 
for cellular internalization. Here we represent the functionalization of a model 
cage, DNA tetrahedron (TD) with a cationic lipid, 
N-[1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA). Atomic 
force microscopy (AFM) and other standard characterization techniques were used 
to explore the co-assembly of the DNA tetrahedron and DOTMA. We revealed a 
simple confocal microscopy-based approach to show the enhancement in the 
cellular uptake of DNA nanocages. This new method will find multiple 
applications in delivery applications such as gene transfection, drug delivery 
and targeted bioimaging."
829,"Triple-negative breast cancer TNBC) is a malignant tumor with high incidence and 
high mortality that threaten the health of women worldwide. Circular RNAs 
(circRNAs) are a new class of noncoding RNAs that participate in the biological 
processes of various tumors, but the regulatory roles of circRNAs in TNBC have 
not been fully elucidated. In this study, the expression and characterization of 
circDUSP1 was detected via quantitative real-time PCR, nuclear-cytoplasmic 
fractionation assay, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Then, in vitro and 
in vivo functional experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of 
circDUSP1 in TNBC. The interaction among circDUSP1, miR-761, DACT2 were 
confirmed by dual luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down, and RNA 
immunoprecipitation experiments. We identified the circRNA named circDUSP1 that 
was inversely correlated with tumorigenesis and progression in TNBC. 
Overexpression of circDUSP1 significantly attenuated cell proliferation, 
migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, while increased the 
sensitivity of TNBC cells to paclitaxel. In-depth mechanism analysis indicated 
that circDUSP1 acts as an endogenous sponge of miR-761 to reduce its suppression 
on target gene DACT2 expression in TNBC. Upregulation of miR-761 or 
downregulation of DACT2 partially reversed the biological process of TNBC and 
the prognosis of paclitaxel affected by circDUSP1. Taken together, our findings 
revealed a role for the regulation of the miR-761/DACT2 axis by circDUSP1 in the 
biological process of TNBC. These results provided new insights into the 
biological mechanism and targeted therapy of TNBC."
830,"Prometastatic and antitumor effects of different anesthetics have been 
previously analyzed in several studies with conflicting results. Thus, the 
underlying perioperative molecular mechanisms mediated by anesthetics 
potentially affecting tumor phenotype and metastasis remain unclear. It was 
hypothesized that anesthetic‑specific long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) expression 
changes are induced in the blood circulation and play a crucial role in tumor 
outcome. In the present study, high‑throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR 
were performed in order to identify lncRNA and mRNA expression changes affected 
by two therapeutic regimes, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and volatile 
anesthetic gas (VAG) in patients undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC) resection. 
Total blood RNA was isolated prior to and following resection and characterized 
using RNA sequencing. mRNA‑lncRNA interactions and their roles in cancer‑related 
signaling of differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified using 
bioinformatics analyses. The comparison of these two time points revealed 35 
differentially expressed lncRNAs in the TIVA‑group, and 25 in the VAG‑group, 
whereas eight were shared by both groups. Two lncRNAs in the TIVA‑group, and 23 
in the VAG‑group of in silico identified target‑mRNAs were confirmed as 
differentially regulated in the NGS dataset of the present study. Pathway 
analysis was performed and cancer relevant canonical pathways for TIVA were 
identified. Target‑mRNA analysis of VAG revealed a markedly worsened 
immunological response against cancer. In this proof‑of‑concept study, 
anesthesic‑specific expression changes in lncRNA and mRNA profiles in blood were 
successfully identified. Moreover, the data of the present study provide the 
first evidence that anesthesia‑induced lncRNA pattern changes may contribute 
further in the observed differences in CRC outcome following tumor resection."
831,"High glycolytic activity of cancer cells leads to lactic acidosis (LA) in the 
tumor microenvironment. LA is not merely a consequence of metabolic activities, 
but also has functional roles in metabolic reprogramming and cancer progression. 
Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells exhibit a high dependency on glycolysis for 
survival and growth, but the specific effects of LA on cellular characteristics 
remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that long-term LA (LLA) reprograms the 
metabolic phenotype of CCA cells from glycolytic to oxidative, and enhances 
their migratory activity. In CCA cell culture, short-term LA (SLA, 24 h) showed 
a growth inhibitory effect, while extended LA exposure for more than two weeks 
(LLA) led to enhanced cell motility. Coincidentally, LLA enhanced the 
respiratory capacity with an increase in mitochondrial mass. Inhibition of 
mitochondrial function abolished LLA-induced cell motility, suggesting that 
metabolic remodeling affects the phenotypic outcomes. RNA-sequencing analysis 
revealed that LLA upregulated genes associated with cell migration and 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), 
which encodes a pro-EMT-secreted protein. Inhibition of THBS1 resulted in the 
suppression of both LLA-induced cell motility and respiratory capacity. 
Moreover, high THBS1 expression was associated with poor survival in patients 
with CCA. Collectively, our study suggests that the increased expression of 
THBS1 by LLA promotes phenotypic alterations leading to CCA progression."
832,"INTRODUCTION: Mutations in the RPGR gene are responsible for one of the most 
prevalent and severe types of retinitis pigmentosa. Gene therapy has shown great 
promise to treat inherited retinal diseases, and currently, four RPGR gene 
therapy vectors are being evaluated in clinical trials.
AREAS COVERED: This manuscript reviews the gene therapy products that are in 
development for X-linked retinitis pigmentosa caused by mutations in RPGR, and 
the challenges that scientists and clinicians have faced.
EXPERT OPINION: The development of a gene therapy product for RPGR-associated 
retinal degeneration has been a great challenge due to the incomplete 
understanding of the underlying genetics and mechanism of action of RPGR, and on 
the other hand, due to the instability of the RPGR gene. Three of the four gene 
therapy vectors currently in clinical trials include a codon-optimized version 
of the human RPGR sequence, and the other vector contains a shortened version of 
the human RPGR. To date, the only Phase I/II results published in a 
peer-reviewed journal demonstrate a good safety profile and an improvement in 
the visual field using a codon optimized version of RPGRORF15."
833,"Tumor is the major cause of death all around the world in recent days. Early 
detection and prediction of a cancer type are important for a patient's 
well-being. Functional genomic data has recently been used in the effective and 
early detection of cancer. According to previous research, the use of microarray 
data in cancer prediction has evidenced two main problems as high dimensionality 
and limited sample size. Several researchers have used numerous statistical and 
machine learning-based methods to classify cancer types but still, limitations 
are there which makes cancer classification a difficult job. Deep Learning (DL) 
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been proven with effective analyses 
of unstructured data including gene expression data. In the proposed method gene 
expression data for five types of cancer is collected from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA). Prominent features are selected using a hybrid Particle Swarm 
Optimization (PSO) and Random Forest (RF) algorithm followed by the use of 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Finally, for 
classification blend of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bi-directional 
Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) is used to predict the target type of cancer. 
Experimental results demonstrate that accuracy of the proposed method is 96.89%. 
As compared to existing work, our method outperformed with better results."
834,"The use of small molecule kinase inhibitors, which target specific enzymes that 
are overactive in cancer cells, has revolutionized cancer patient treatment. To 
treat some types of breast cancer, CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as palbociclib, have 
been developed that target the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor 
suppressor gene. Acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors may be due to 
activation of the AKT pro‑survival signaling pathway that stimulates several 
processes, such as growth, metastasis and changes in metabolism that support 
rapid cell proliferation. The aim of the present study was to investigate 
whether targeting ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), a downstream target of AKT, may 
combine with CDK4/6 inhibition to inhibit tumorigenesis. The present study 
determined that ACLY is activated in breast and pancreatic cancer cells in 
response to palbociclib treatment and AKT mediates this effect. Inhibition of 
ACLY using bempedoic acid used in combination with palbociclib reduced cell 
viability in a panel of breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. This effect was 
also observed using breast cancer cells grown in 3D cell culture. 
Mechanistically, palbociclib inhibited cell proliferation, whereas bempedoic 
acid stimulated apoptosis. Finally, using Transwell invasion assays and 
immunoblotting, the present study demonstrated that ACLY inhibition blocked cell 
invasion, when used alone or in combination with palbociclib. These data may 
yield useful information that could guide the development of future therapies 
aimed at the reduction of acquired resistance observed clinically."
835,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a frequent malignant tumor of the 
kidney which has a dismal prognosis. At present, targeted therapies and 
immunotherapy have achieved significant results; however, the overall survival 
rate of patients with ccRCC remains unacceptably poor. It is therefore necessary 
to find novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets for ccRCC. It has been reported 
that enolase 2 (ENO2) is an oncogene, although its function in the immune 
microenvironment and in the growth of ccRCC has yet to be fully elucidated. The 
present study analyzed the data of patients with ccRCC both from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases, and from 
clinical samples obtained from Third Affiliated Hospital of the Second Military 
Medical University to investigate the role of ENO2 in the progression of ccRCC 
and the correlation between ENO2 and certain clinical features. It was found 
that the expression of ENO2 was elevated both in patients with ccRCC retrieved 
from the GEO and TCGA databases and in clinical ccRCC samples obtained from 
Third Affiliated Hospital of the Second Military Medical University. In 
addition, the prognosis of patients was poorer when ENO2 was highly expressed. 
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) confirmed 
that ENO2 participated in the regulation of various pathways in ccRCC. In vitro 
experiments including Cell Counting Kit‑8 cell proliferation assay, Transwell 
and Matrigel assays confirmed that ENO2 could promote the proliferation and 
migration of ccRCC cells. Furthermore, a number of immunosuppressive indicators 
were identified that positively correlated with ENO2 expression. In conclusion, 
the present study revealed that ENO2 expression promotes the proliferation, 
invasion and migration of ccRCC cells, and may serve as a novel predictor to 
evaluate prognosis and the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade treatment for 
patients with ccRCC."
836,"Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a common clinical disease of the 
reproductive system in which patients lose normal gonadal function prior to the 
age of 40. Common pathogenic factors include iatrogenic injury, genetics, 
inflammation, autoimmune, environmental and psychological factors. Patients with 
POI experience decreased estrogen secretion levels, ovulation disorder and 
infertility. POI appears frequently in clinical practice and the burden of the 
disease is heavy; however, the detailed pathological mechanism requires further 
experimental evaluation. Furthermore, there is a lack of effective treatment 
options. Certain causes of the pathogenesis of POI can be explained by 
epigenetic changes. Front fork transcription factor 3 (FOXO3) is a member of the 
forkhead box family of transcription factors. FOXO3 was initially considered to 
affect insulin/insulin growth factor signal transduction. However, the target 
gene range of FOXO3 includes numerous genes that affect metabolism and protein 
stability and are associated with aging. There is an association between 
decreased FOXO3 expression levels and POI. In the present review article, the 
role of FOXO3 in POI was evaluated, which emphasized the importance of this 
protein in the investigation of this disease. Moreover, the present review 
evaluated the evidence for the potential targets and biomarkers of FOXO3 that 
may be used in the treatment and diagnosis of POI."
837,"Advanced antibacterial biomaterials can help reduce the severe consequences of 
infections. Using copper compounds is an excellent option to achieve this goal; 
they offer a combination of regenerative and antimicrobial functions. In this 
study, new CuCl2-doped sol-gel coatings were developed and physicochemically 
characterised. Their osteogenic and inflammatory responses were tested in vitro 
using human osteoblasts and THP-1 macrophages. Their antibacterial effect was 
evaluated using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The Cu influence on 
the adsorption of human serum proteins was analysed employing proteomics. The 
materials released Cu2+ and were not cytotoxic. The osteoblasts in contact with 
these materials showed an increased ALP, BMP2 and OCN gene expression. THP-1 
showed an increase in pro-inflammatory markers related to M1 polarization. 
Moreover, Cu-doped coatings displayed a potent antibacterial behaviour against 
E. coli and S. aureus. The copper ions affected the adsorption of proteins 
related to immunity, coagulation, angiogenesis, fibrinolysis, and osteogenesis. 
Interestingly, the coatings had increased affinity to proteins with 
antibacterial functions and proteins linked to the complement system activation 
that can lead to direct bacterial killing via large pore-forming complexes. 
These results contribute to our understanding of the antibacterial mechanisms of 
Cu-biomaterials and their interaction with biological systems."
838,"BACKGROUND: NDRG-1 (N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1) is a member of NDRG 
family that plays essential roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, and 
stress responses. Although the expression of NDRG1 is regulated by fluid shear 
stress, its roles in vascular biology remain poorly understood. The purpose of 
the study is to determine the functional significance of NDRG1 in vascular 
inflammation and remodeling.
METHODS AND RESULTS: By using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western 
blot, and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that the expression of NDRG1 is 
markedly increased in cytokine-stimulated endothelial cells and in human and 
mouse atherosclerotic lesions. To determine the role of NDRG1 in endothelial 
activation, we performed loss-of-function studies using NDRG1 short hairpin RNA. 
Our results demonstrate that NDRG1 knockdown by lentivirus bearing NDRG1 short 
hairpin RNA substantially attenuates both IL-1β and TNF-α (tumor necrosis 
factor-α)-induced expression of cytokines/chemokines and adhesion molecules. 
Intriguingly, inhibition of NDRG1 also significantly attenuates the expression 
of procoagulant molecules, such as PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor type 
1) and TF (tissue factor), and increases the expression of TM (thrombomodulin) 
and t-PA (tissue-type plasminogen activator), thus exerting potent 
antithrombotic effects in endothelial cells. Mechanistically, we showed that 
NDRG1 interacts with orphan Nur77 (nuclear receptor) and functionally inhibits 
the transcriptional activity of Nur77 and NF-κB (nuclear factor Kappa B) in 
endothelial cells. Moreover, in NDRG1 knockdown cells, both cytokine-induced 
mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, c-Jun phosphorylation, and AP-1 
(activator protein 1) transcriptional activity are substantially inhibited. 
Neointima and atherosclerosis formation induced by carotid artery ligation and 
arterial thrombosis were markedly attenuated in endothelial cell-specific NDRG1 
knockout mice compared with their wild-type littermates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results for the first time identify NDRG1 as a critical 
mediator implicated in regulating endothelial inflammation, thrombotic 
responses, and vascular remodeling, and suggest that inhibition of NDRG1 may 
represent a novel therapeutic strategy for inflammatory vascular diseases, such 
as atherothrombosis and restenosis."
839,"Several studies have suggested a strong interaction between the circadian clock 
and lipid metabolism in mammals. The circadian clock is driven by endogenous 
cyclic gene expression patterns, commonly referred to as clock genes, and 
transcription-translation negative feedback loops. Clock genes regulate the 
transcription of some lipid metabolism-related genes; however, the relationship 
between the circadian clock and triglyceride (TG) accumulation at the cellular 
level remains unclear. Here, we evaluated rhythms of intracellular TG 
accumulation levels as well as the expression of clock genes and lipid 
metabolism-related genes for 54 h in mouse and bovine adipose-derived cell 
cultures. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report 
demonstrating that TG accumulation exhibits diurnal variations, with the pattern 
differing among cell types. Furthermore, we found that expression of clock genes 
and corresponding lipid metabolism-related genes exhibited circadian rhythms. 
Our results suggest that the cellular clock regulates lipid metabolism-related 
genes to relate circadian rhythms of TG accumulation in each cell type. We 
anticipate that the amount of fat stored depends on the timing of the supply of 
glucose-the precursor of fat. The findings of this study will contribute to the 
advancement of chrono-nutrition."
840,"BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance has emerged in various western flower thrips 
(WFT) populations across the world, threatening the efficiency of chemical 
control applications. Elucidation of insecticide resistance mechanisms at the 
molecular level provides markers for the development of diagnostics, to monitor 
the trait and support evidence-based resistance management.
RESULTS: TaqMan and Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) diagnostics were developed and 
validated, against Sanger sequencing, in individual and pooled WFT samples, 
respectively, for the: G275E mutation (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α6 gene- 
nAChR α6) associated with resistance to nAChR allosteric modulators - site I 
(spinosyns), L1014F, T929I, T929C and T292V mutations (voltage-gated sodium 
channel gene- vgsc) linked with pyrethroid resistance and I1017M (chitin 
synthase 1 gene- chs1) conferring resistance to growth inhibitors affecting CHS1 
(benzoylureas). The detection limits of ddPCR assays for mutant allelic 
frequencies (MAFs) were in the range of 0.1%-0.2%. The assays were applied in 
nine WFT field populations from Crete, Greece. The G275E (MAF = 29.66%-100.0%), 
T929I and T929V (combined MAFs = 100%), L1014F (MAF = 11.01%-37.29%) and I1017M 
(MAF = 17.74%-51.07%) mutations, were present in all populations.
CONCLUSION: The molecular diagnostics panel that was developed in this study can 
facilitate the quick and sensitive pesticide resistance monitoring of WFT 
populations at the molecular level, to support evidence-based IRM strategies."
841,"The nuclear pore complex (NPC) provides a permeable barrier between the 
nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. In a subset of NPC constituents that regulate meiosis 
in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we found that nucleoporin Nup132 
(homolog of human Nup133) deficiency resulted in transient leakage of nuclear 
proteins during meiosis I, as observed in the nup132 gene-deleted mutant. The 
nuclear protein leakage accompanied the liberation of the small ubiquitin-like 
modifier (SUMO)-specific ubiquitin-like protease 1 (Ulp1) from the NPC. Ulp1 
retention at the nuclear pore prevented nuclear protein leakage and restored 
normal meiosis in a mutant lacking Nup132. Furthermore, using mass spectrometry 
analysis, we identified DNA topoisomerase 2 (Top2) and RCC1-related protein 
(Pim1) as the target proteins for SUMOylation. SUMOylation levels of Top2 and 
Pim1 were altered in meiotic cells lacking Nup132. HyperSUMOylated Top2 
increased the binding affinity at the centromeres of nup132 gene-deleted meiotic 
cells. The Top2-12KR sumoylation mutant was less localized to the centromeric 
regions. Our results suggest that SUMOylation of chromatin-binding proteins is 
regulated by the NPC-bound SUMO-specific protease and is important for the 
progression of meiosis."
842,"Known hereditary human diseases featuring impaired copper trafficking across 
cellular membranes involve ATP7A (Menkes disease, occipital horn disease, 
X-linked spinal muscular atrophy type 3) and ATP7B (Wilson disease). Herein, we 
report a newborn infant of consanguineous parents with a homozygous pathogenic 
variant in a highly conserved sequence of SLC31A1, coding for the copper influx 
transporter 1, CTR1. This missense variant, c.236T > C, was detected by whole 
exome sequencing. The infant was born with pulmonary hypoplasia and suffered 
from severe respiratory distress immediately after birth, necessitating 
aggressive mechanical ventilation. At 2 weeks of age, multifocal brain 
hemorrhages were diagnosed by cerebral ultrasound and magnetic resonance 
imaging, together with increased tortuosity of cerebral arteries. Ensuing 
seizures were only partly controlled by antiepileptic drugs, and the infant 
became progressively comatose. Laboratory investigations revealed very low serum 
concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin. No hair shaft abnormalities were 
detected by dermatoscopy or light microscopic analyses of embedded hair shafts 
obtained at 4 weeks of life. The infant died after redirection of care and 
elective cessation of invasive mechanical ventilation at 1 month of age. This 
case adds SLC31A1 to the genes implicated in severe hereditary disorders of 
copper transport in humans."
843,"Mycorrhizal fungi form mutually beneficial interactions with a wide range of 
terrestrial plants. During this symbiosis, the associated fungus provides 
mineral nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, to its host plant in 
exchange of photosynthesis-derived carbohydrates. Genome sequencing of 
mycorrhizal fungi has shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and 
ectomycorrhizal fungi have a restricted set of plant-cell wall degrading enzymes 
(PCWDE) genes, while orchid and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi have an extended PCWDE 
repertoire similar to soil decomposers and wood-decay fungi. On the other hand, 
mycorrhizal fungi have retained a substantial set of carbohydrate active enzymes 
(CAZymes) acting on microbial polysaccharides. Functional analysis has shown 
that several of the remaining PCWDEs are involved in the fungal root 
colonization and establishment of the symbiotic interface. In this review, we 
highlight the current knowledge on the evolution and function of PCWDEs in 
mycorrhizal fungi."
844,"BACKGROUND: Humans with inactivating mutations in growth hormone receptor (GHR) 
have lower rates of cancer, including prostate cancer. Similarly, mice with 
inactivating Ghr mutations are protected from prostatic intraepithelial 
neoplasia in the C3(1)/TAg prostate cancer model. However, gaps in clinical 
relevance in those models persist. The current study addresses these gaps and 
the ongoing role of Ghr in prostate cancer using loss-of-function and 
gain-of-function models.
METHODS: Conditional Ghr inactivation was achieved in the C3(1)/TAg model by 
employing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre and a prostate-specific Cre. In parallel, a 
transgenic GH antagonist was also used. Pathology, proliferation, and gene 
expression of 6-month old mouse prostates were assessed. Analysis of The Cancer 
Genome Atlas data was conducted to identify GHR overexpression in a subset of 
human prostate cancers. Ghr overexpression was modeled in PTEN-P2 and TRAMP-C2 
mouse prostate cancer cells using stable transfectants. The growth, 
proliferation, and gene expression effects of Ghr overexpression was assessed in 
vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: Loss-of-function for Ghr globally or in prostatic epithelial cells 
reduced proliferation and stratification of the prostatic epithelium in the 
C3(1)/TAg model. Genes and gene sets involved in the immune system and 
tumorigenesis, for example, were dysregulated upon global Ghr disruption. 
Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed higher GHR expression in human 
prostate cancers with ERG-fusion genes or ETV1-fusion genes. Modeling the GHR 
overexpression observed in these human prostate cancers by overexpressing Ghr in 
mouse prostate cancer cells with mutant Pten or T-antigen driver genes increased 
proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Ghr overexpression 
regulated the expression of multiple genes oppositely to Ghr loss-of-function 
models.
CONCLUSIONS: Loss-of-function and gain-of-function Ghr models, including 
prostatic epithelial cell specific alterations in Ghr, altered proliferation, 
and gene expression. These data suggest that changes in GHR activity in human 
prostatic epithelial cells play a role in proliferation and gene regulation in 
prostate cancer, suggesting the potential for disrupting GH signaling, for 
example by the FDA approved GH antagonist pegvisomant, may be beneficial in 
treating prostate cancer."
845,"The bioethical debate about using gene drives to alter or eradicate wild 
populations has focused mostly on issues concerning short-term risk assessment 
and management, governance and oversight, and public and community engagement, 
but has not examined big-picture- 'where is this going?'-questions in great 
depth. In other areas of bioethical controversy, big-picture questions often 
enter the public forum via slippery slope arguments. Given the incredible 
potential of gene drive organisms to alter the Earth's biota, it is somewhat 
surprising that slippery slope arguments have not played a more prominent role 
in ethical and policy debates about these emerging technologies. In this 
article, we examine a type of slippery slope argument against using gene drives 
to alter or suppress wild pest populations and consider whether it has a role to 
play in ethical and policy debates. Although we conclude that this argument does 
not provide compelling reasons for banning the use of gene drives in wild pest 
populations, we believe that it still has value as a morally instructive 
cautionary narrative that can motivate scientists, ethicists, and members of the 
public to think more clearly about appropriate vs. inappropriate uses of gene 
drive technologies, the long-term and cumulative and emergent risks of using 
gene drives in wild populations, and steps that can be taken to manage these 
risks, such as protecting wilderness areas where people can enjoy life forms 
that have not been genetically engineered."
846,"Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) is treated as a homogeneous disease, although the 
expression of NEUROD1, ASCL1, POU2F3, and YAP1 identifies distinct molecular 
subtypes. The MYC oncogene, amplified in SCLC, was recently shown to act as a 
lineage-specific factor to associate subtypes with histological classes. Indeed, 
MYC-driven SCLCs show a distinct metabolic profile and drug sensitivity. To 
disentangle their molecular features, we focused on the co-amplified PVT1, 
frequently overexpressed and originating circular (circRNA) and chimeric RNAs. 
We analyzed hsa_circ_0001821 (circPVT1) and PVT1/AKT3 (chimPVT1) as examples of 
such transcripts, respectively, to unveil their tumorigenic contribution to 
SCLC. In detail, circPVT1 activated a pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic 
program when over-expressed in lung cells, and knockdown of chimPVT1 induced a 
decrease in cell growth and an increase of apoptosis in SCLC in vitro. Moreover, 
the investigated PVT1 transcripts underlined a functional connection between MYC 
and YAP1/POU2F3, suggesting that they contribute to the transcriptional 
landscape associated with MYC amplification. In conclusion, we have uncovered a 
functional role of circular and chimeric PVT1 transcripts in SCLC; these 
entities may prove useful as novel biomarkers in MYC-amplified tumors. This

847,"Immunotherapy has led to a paradigm shift in the treatment of cancer. Current 
cancer immunotherapies are mostly antibody-based, thus possessing advantages in 
regard to pharmacodynamics (e.g., specificity and efficacy). However, they have 
limitations in terms of pharmacokinetics including long half-lives, poor 
tissue/tumor penetration, and little/no oral bioavailability. In addition, 
therapeutic antibodies are immunogenic, thus may cause unwanted adverse effects. 
Therefore, researchers have shifted their efforts towards the development of 
small molecule-based cancer immunotherapy, as small molecules may overcome the 
above disadvantages associated with antibodies. Further, small molecule-based 
immunomodulators and therapeutic antibodies are complementary modalities for 
cancer treatment, and may be combined to elicit synergistic effects. Recent 
years have witnessed the rapid development of small molecule-based cancer 
immunotherapy. In this review, we describe the current progress in small 
molecule-based immunomodulators (inhibitors/agonists/degraders) for cancer 
therapy, including those targeting PD-1/PD-L1, chemokine receptors, stimulator 
of interferon genes (STING), Toll-like receptor (TLR), etc. The tumorigenesis 
mechanism of various targets and their respective modulators that have entered 
clinical trials are also summarized."
848,"We report the inverse association between the expression of androgen receptor 
(AR) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) in a cohort of patients with metastatic 
castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We also discovered that AR 
represses the IL-1β gene by binding an androgen response element (ARE) half-site 
located within the promoter, which explains the IL-1β expression in AR-negative 
(ARNEG) cancer cells. Consistently, androgen-depletion or AR-pathway inhibitors 
(ARIs) de-repressed IL-1β in ARPOS cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. The 
AR transcriptional repression is sustained by histone de-acetylation at the 
H3K27 mark in the IL-1β promoter. Notably, patients' data suggest that DNA 
methylation prevents IL-1β expression, even if the AR-signaling axis is 
inactive. Our previous studies show that secreted IL-1β supports metastatic 
progression in mice by altering the transcriptome of tumor-associated bone 
stroma. Thus, in prostate cancer patients harboring ARNEG tumor cells or treated 
with ADT/ARIs, and with the IL-1β gene unmethylated, IL-1β could condition the 
metastatic microenvironment to sustain disease progression."
849,"Inflammatory edema formation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (neutrophil) 
accumulation are common components of cutaneous vascular inflammation, and their 
assessment is a powerful investigative and drug development tool but typically 
requires independent cohorts of animals to assess each. We have established the 
use of a mathematical formula to estimate the ellipsoidal-shaped volume of the 
edematous wheal or bleb after intradermal injections of substances in mice 
pretreated intravenously with Evans blue dye (which binds to plasma albumin) to 
act as an edema marker. Whereas previous extraction of Evans blue dye with 
formamide is suitable for all strains of mice, we report this quicker and more 
reliable assessment of edema volume in situ. This therefore allows neutrophil 
accumulation to be assessed from the same mouse using the myeloperoxidase assay. 
Importantly, we examined the influence of Evans blue dye on the spectrometry 
readout at the wavelength at which myeloperoxidase activity is measured. The 
results indicate that it is feasible to quantify edema formation and neutrophil 
accumulation in the same mouse skin site. Thus, we show techniques that can 
assess edema formation and neutrophil accumulation at the same site in the same 
mouse, allowing paired measurements and reducing the total use of mice by 50%."
850,"BACKGROUND: Recently, the in vitro blood brain barrier (BBB) models derived from 
human pluripotent stem cells have been given extensive attention in therapeutics 
due to the implications it has with the health of the central nervous system. It 
is essential to create an accurate BBB model in vitro in order to better 
understand the properties of the BBB and how it can respond to inflammatory 
stimulation and be passed by targeted or non-targeted cell therapeutics, more 
specifically extracellular vesicles.
METHODS: Brain-specific pericytes (iPCs) were differentiated from iPSK3 cells 
using dual SMAD signaling inhibitors and Wnt activation plus fibroblast growth 
factor 2 (FGF-2). The derived cells were characterized by immunostaining, flow 
cytometry and RT-PCR. In parallel, blood vessels organoids were derived using 
Wnt activation, BMP4, FGF2, VEGF and SB431542. The organoids were replated and 
treated with retinoic acid to enhance the blood brain barrier (BBB) features in 
the differentiated brain endothelial cells (iECs). Co-culture was performed for 
the iPCs and iECs in transwell system and 3-D microfluidics channels.
RESULTS: The derived iPCs expressed common markers PDGFRb and NG2, as well as 
brain-specific genes FOXF2, ABCC9, KCNJ8, and ZIC1. The derived iECs expressed 
common endothelial cell markers CD31, VE-cadherin, as well as BBB-associated 
genes BRCP, GLUT-1, PGP, ABCC1, OCLN, SLC2A1. The co-culture of the two cell 
types responded to the stimulation of amyloid β42 oligomers by the upregulation 
of expression of TNFa, IL6, NFKB, Casp3, SOD2 and TP53. The co-culture also 
showed the property of trans-endothelial electrical resistance. The 
proof-of-concept vascularization strategy was demonstrated in a 3-D 
microfluidics-based device.
CONCLUSION: The derived iPCs and iECs have brain-specific properties and the 
co-culture of iPCs and iECs provides an in vitro BBB model that show 
inflammatory response. This study has significance in establishing 
micro-physiological systems for neurological disease modeling and drug 
screening."
851,"Background. Hypodontia, or the absence of one or more teeth during tooth 
formation, is a highly prevalent dental anomaly. Nevertheless, the main causes 
are still unknown. Mutations in PAX9, MSX1, WNT10A, and AXIN2 genes are most 
commonly associated with non-syndromic tooth agenesis in the literature. This 
study investigated these candidate genes in an Iranian family with non-syndromic 
hypodontia and oligodontia. Methods. Peripheral blood samples of the proband and 
her family members were collected, and DNA extractions using the salting-out 
method were carried out. In addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger 
sequencing for candidate genes were performed. Results. A missense variant 
(rs4904210) was identified in the PAX9 gene, with one heterozygous missense 
variant (rs2240308) and one stop-gained variant (rs121908568) in the AXIN2 gene. 
Conclusion. By surveying similar studies and analyzing the variant in 
bioinformatics websites, we concluded that the heterozygous stop-gained variant 
rs121908568 in exon 8 of the AXIN2 gene could be responsible for tooth agenesis 
in the Iranian population."
852,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that deep learning (DL) methods can produce robust 
prediction of gene expression profile (GEP) in uveal melanoma (UM) based on 
digital cytopathology images.
DESIGN: Evaluation of a diagnostic test or technology.
SUBJECTS PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: Deidentified smeared cytology slides stained 
with hematoxylin and eosin obtained from a fine needle aspirated from UM.
METHODS: Digital whole-slide images were generated by fine-needle aspiration 
biopsies of UM tumors that underwent GEP testing. A multistage DL system was 
developed with automatic region-of-interest (ROI) extraction from digital 
cytopathology images, an attention-based neural network, ROI feature 
aggregation, and slide-level data augmentation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ability of our DL system in predicting GEP on a slide 
(patient) level. Data were partitioned at the patient level (73% training; 27% 
testing).
RESULTS: In total, our study included 89 whole-slide images from 82 patients and 
121 388 unique ROIs. The testing set included 24 slides from 24 patients (12 
class 1 tumors; 12 class 2 tumors; 1 slide per patient). Our DL system for GEP 
prediction achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 
0.944, an accuracy of 91.7%, a sensitivity of 91.7%, and a specificity of 91.7% 
on a slide-level analysis. The incorporation of slide-level feature aggregation 
and data augmentation produced a more predictive DL model (P = 0.0031).
CONCLUSIONS: Our current work established a complete pipeline for GEP prediction 
in UM tumors: from automatic ROI extraction from digital cytopathology 
whole-slide images to slide-level predictions. Our DL system demonstrated robust 
performance and, if validated prospectively, could serve as an image-based 
alternative to GEP testing."

854,"INTRODUCTION: Brain metastases (BM) severely affect the prognosis and quality of 
life of patients with NSCLC. Recently, molecularly targeted agents were found to 
have promising activity against BM in patients with NSCLC whose primary tumors 
carry ""druggable"" mutations. Nevertheless, it remains critical to identify 
specific pathogenic alterations that drive NSCLC-BM and that can provide novel 
and more effective therapeutic targets.
METHODS: To identify potentially targetable pathogenic alterations in NSCLC-BM, 
we profiled somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) in 51 matched pairs of 
primary NSCLC and BM samples from 33 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 18 
patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, we performed 
multiregion copy number profiling on 15 BM samples and whole-exome sequencing on 
40 of 51 NSCLC-BM pairs.
RESULTS: BM consistently had a higher burden of SCNAs compared with the matched 
primary tumors, and SCNAs were typically homogeneously distributed within BM, 
suggesting BM do not undergo extensive evolution once formed. By comparing focal 
SCNAs in matched NSCLC-BM pairs, we identified putative BM-driving alterations 
affecting multiple cancer genes, including several potentially targetable 
alterations in genes such as CDK12, DDR2, ERBB2, and NTRK1, which we validated 
in an independent cohort of 84 BM samples. Finally, we identified putative 
pathogenic alterations in multiple cancer genes, including genes involved in 
epigenome editing and 3D genome organization, such as EP300, CTCF, and STAG2, 
which we validated by targeted sequencing of an independent cohort of 115 BM 
samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study represents the most comprehensive genomic 
characterization of NSCLC-BM available to date, paving the way to functional 
studies aimed at assessing the potential of the identified pathogenic 
alterations as clinical biomarkers and targets."
855,"Species of the tribe Delphinieae (Ranunculaceae) have long been the focus of 
morphological, ecological and evolutionary studies due to their highly 
specialized, nearly zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetrical) spiral flowers with 
nested petal and sepal spurs and reduced petals. The mechanisms underlying the 
development and evolution of Delphinieae flowers, however, remain unclear. Here, 
by conducting extensive phylogenetic, comparative transcriptomic, expression, 
and functional studies, we clarified the evolutionary histories, expression 
patterns, and functions of floral organ identity and symmetry genes in 
Delphinieae. We found that duplication and/or diversification of APETALA3-3 
(AP3-3), AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6), CYCLOIDEA (CYC) and DIVARICATA (DIV) lineage 
genes was tightly associated with the origination of Delphinieae flowers. 
Specifically, an AGL6-lineage member (such as the Delphinium ajacis AGL6-1a) 
represses sepal spur formation and petal development in the lateral and ventral 
parts of the flower while determining petal identity redundantly with AGL6-1b. 
By contrast, two CYC2-like genes, CYC2b and CYC2a, define the dorsal and 
lateral-ventral identities of the flower, respectively, and form complex 
regulatory links with AP3-3, AGL6-1a and DIV1. Therefore, duplication and 
diversification of floral symmetry genes, as well as co-option of the duplicated 
copies into the pre-existing floral regulatory network, have been key for the 
origin of Delphinieae flowers."
856,"Insect herbivores are amongst the most destructive plant pests, damaging both 
naturally occurring and domesticated plants. As sessile organisms, plants make 
use of structural and chemical barriers to counteract herbivores. However, over 
75 percent of herbivorous insect species are well adapted to their host's 
defenses and these specialists are generally difficult to ward off. By actively 
antagonizing the number of insect eggs deposited on plants, future damage by the 
herbivore's offspring can be limited. Therefore, it is important to understand 
which plant traits influence attractiveness for oviposition, especially for 
specialist insects that are well adapted to their host plants. In this study, we 
investigated the oviposition preference of Pieris butterflies (Lepidoptera: 
Pieridae) by offering them the choice between 350 different naturally occurring 
Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Using a genome-wide association study of the 
oviposition data and subsequent fine mapping with full genome sequences of 164 
accessions, we identified WRKY42 and AOC1 as candidate genes that are associated 
with the oviposition preference observed for Pieris butterflies. Host plant 
choice assays with A. thaliana genotypes impaired in WRKY42 or AOC1 function 
confirmed a clear role for WRKY42 in oviposition preference of female Pieris 
butterflies, while for AOC1 the effect was mild. In contrast, WRKY42-impaired 
plants, that were preferred for oviposition by butterflies, negatively impacted 
offspring performance. These findings exemplify that plant genotype can have 
opposite effects on oviposition preference and caterpillar performance. This 
knowledge can be used for breeding trap crops or crops that are unattractive for 
oviposition by pest insects."

858,"Recently, the global spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales has 
become a concern, and rapid detection methods are required. We have developed a 
rapid and inexpensive multiplex real-time PCR with melting curve analysis using 
the BD MAX™ system and evaluated it. We used 31 carbapenemase-producing 
Gram-negative bacteria (blaIMP group, 12; blaGES group, 6; blaNDM group, 5; 
blaVIM group, 3; blaKPC group, 3; blaOXA-48-like group, 1 strain; and blaIMP 
group + blaGES, 1 strain), 10 AmpC-producing Gram-negative bacteria, and 10 
ESBLproducing Gram-negative bacteria. A BD MAX™ open platform system was used. 
Carbapenemase-positive and carbapenemase-negative strains were correctly 
identified 30 of 31 (excluding a blaIMP group and blaGES group co-coding strain) 
and all 20 of 20 isolates, respectively. Melting temperature (Tm) values of the 
various genes were as follows: blaIMP group, 81.2±0.5°C; blaVIM group, 
91.8±0.4°C; blaNDM group, 85.4±0.3°C; blaGES group, 90.5±0.3°C; blaKPC group, 
94.1±0.5°C; and blaOXA-48-like group, 82.1°C. Identification of the various 
genotypes was possible from the Tm values. However, only a peak derived from the 
blaGES group could be detected in the strains producing both blaIMP group and 
blaGES group simultaneously, suggesting that only the genotype with the highest 
expression level could be captured in cases of simultaneous production. In the 
carbapenemase-negative strains, no obvious peaks were observed in the 20 AmpC 
and 20 ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria, and even when Tm values were 
detected, the dF/dT values were low and easily differentiated. This method 
appears to be very useful as a rapid and inexpensive test that can provide 
detection in about 2 hours."
859,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the 
absence of a functional copy of the Survival of Motor Neuron 1 gene (SMN1). The 
nearly identical paralog, SMN2, cannot compensate for the loss of SMN1 because 
exon 7 is aberrantly skipped from most SMN2 transcripts, a process mediated by 
synergistic activities of Sam68/KHDRBS1 and hnRNP A1. This results in the 
production of a truncated, non-functional protein that is rapidly degraded. Here 
we present several crystal structures of Sam68 RNA-binding domain (RBD). 
Sam68-RBD forms stable symmetric homodimers by antiparallel association of 
helices α3 from two monomers. However, the details of domain organization and 
the dimerization interface differ significantly from previously characterized 
homologs. We demonstrate that Sam68 and hnRNP A1 can simultaneously bind 
proximal motifs within the central region of SMN2(ex7). Further, we show that 
the RNA-binding pockets of the two proteins are close to each other in their 
heterodimeric complex and identify contact residues using crosslinking-mass 
spectrometry. We present a model of the ternary Sam68·SMN2(ex7)·hnRNP A1 complex 
that reconciles all available information on SMN1/2 splicing. Our findings have 
important implications for the etiology of SMA and open new avenues for the 
design of novel therapeutics to treat splicing diseases. This article is

860,"Coral reef fishes are diverse in ecology and behaviour and show remarkable 
colour variability. Investigating the visual pigment gene (opsin) expression in 
these fishes makes it possible to associate their visual genotype and phenotype 
(spectral sensitivities) to visual tasks, such as feeding strategy or 
conspecific detection. By studying all major damselfish clades (Pomacentridae) 
and representatives from five other coral reef fish families, we show that the 
long-wavelength-sensitive (lws) opsin is highly expressed in algivorous and less 
or not expressed in zooplanktivorous species. Lws is also upregulated in species 
with orange/red colours (reflectance > 520 nm) and expression is highest in 
orange/red-coloured algivores. Visual models from the perspective of a typical 
damselfish indicate that sensitivity to longer wavelengths does enhance the 
ability to detect the red to far-red component of algae and orange/red-coloured 
conspecifics, possibly enabling social signalling. Character state 
reconstructions indicate that in the early evolutionary history of damselfishes, 
there was no lws expression and no orange/red colouration. Omnivory was most 
often the dominant state. Although herbivory was sometimes dominant, 
zooplanktivory was never dominant. Sensitivity to long wavelength (increased lws 
expression) only emerged in association with algivory but never with 
zooplanktivory. Higher lws expression is also exploited by social signalling in 
orange/red, which emerged after the transition to algivory. Although the 
relative timing of traits may deviate by different reconstructions and 
alternative explanations are possible, our results are consistent with sensory 
bias whereby social signals evolve as a correlated response to natural selection 
on sensory system properties in other contexts."
861,"Approximately 50-55% of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) patients 
have MYC oncogenic pathway activation. As MYC is not directly targetable, we 
have analyzed molecular pathways enriched in MYC-high HGSOC tumors to identify 
potential therapeutic targets. Here, we report that MYC-high HGSOC tumors show 
enrichment in genes controlled by NRF2, antioxidant signaling pathway along with 
increased thioredoxin redox activity. Treatment of MYC-high HGSOC tumors cells 
with FDA-approved thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1) inhibitor auranofin resulted 
in significant growth suppression and apoptosis in MYC-high HGSOC cells in 
vitro, and also significantly reduced tumor growth in a MYC-high HGSOC 
patient-derived tumor xenograft. We found that auranofin treatment inhibited 
glycolysis in MYC-high cells via oxidation-induced GAPDH inhibition. 
Interestingly, in response to auranofin-induced glycolysis inhibition, MYC-high 
HGSOC cells switched to glutamine metabolism for survival. Depletion of 
glutamine with either glutamine starvation or glutaminase (GLS1) inhibitor 
CB-839 exerted synergistic anti-tumor activity with auranofin in HGSOC cells and 
OVCAR-8 cell line xenograft. These findings suggest that applying a combined 
therapy of GLS1 inhibitor and TrxR1 inhibitor could effectively treat MYC-high 
HGSOC patients."
862,"The cytochrome b6f (Cyt b6f) complex is a multisubunit protein complex in 
chloroplast thylakoid membranes required for photosynthetic electron transport. 
Here we report the isolation and characterization of the new tiny albino 1 
(nta1) mutant in Arabidopsis, which had severe defects in Cyt b6f accumulation 
and chloroplast development. Gene cloning unveiled that the nta1 phenotypes were 
caused by the disruption of a single nuclear gene, NTA1, which encodes an 
integral thylakoid membrane protein conserved across green algae and plants. 
Overexpression of NTA1 completely rescued the nta1 phenotypes, while knockout of 
NTA1 in wild type plants recapitulated the mutant phenotypes. Loss of NTA1 
function severely impaired the accumulation of multiprotein complexes related to 
photosynthesis in thylakoid membranes, particularly the components of Cyt b6f. 
Furthermore, NTA1 was shown to directly interact with four subunits (Cyt 
b6/PetB, PetD, PetG and PetN) of Cyt b6f through the DUF1279 domain and 
C-terminal sequence to mediate their assembly. Taken together, our study 
identified NTA1 as a new and key regulator of chloroplast development, which 
plays essential roles in the assembly of Cyt b6f complex through interacting 
with multiple Cyt b6f subunits."
863,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) form a group of RNAs greater than 200 nucleotides 
exhibiting low or no coding potential, which are involved in diverse biological 
functions through their molecular interaction with proteins, DNA or other RNAs. 
With the emergence of advanced high-throughput RNA sequencing technologies, tens 
of thousands of novel long noncoding RNAs have been identified in plant 
transcriptomes in the last decade. More importantly, functional studies revealed 
that several lncRNAs play key regulatory roles in plant development and stress 
responses. In this review, we mainly focus on summarizing recent progresses 
uncovering regulatory roles and mechanisms of lncRNAs during plant life cycle, 
and briefly discuss the possible biotechnological applications of lncRNAs for 
plant breeding."
864,"BACKGROUND: Accumulating studies have evaluated the association between MAP3K1 
polymorphisms and cancer prognosis. However, the results of these studies are 
conflicting. Given the potential impact of MAP3K1 rs889312 SNP on the prognosis 
of various cancers, this meta-analysis was performed to obtain solid and 
credible evidence.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study was performed according to the PRISMA 2020 
statement. A comprehensive article search was conducted to find and select 
articles from multiple databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of 
Science, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library, published up to 15th September 2022. 
The data analysis was performed with Review Manager v5.2. Pooled HR with its 95% 
CI and p-value was calculated where HR >1 suggests worse/poor survival and HR <1 
suggests better survival of cancer patients.
RESULTS: A total of five articles comprising 24 439 patients were included for 
both qualitative and quantitative data synthesis. It was found that only the 
dominant genetic model (AC + CC vs. AA) showed a statistically significant poor 
overall survival for MAP3K1 rs889312 polymorphism (HR = 1.25, 95% 
CI = 1.06-1.47, p = .01). In addition, publication bias analysis by the Egger's 
test and the Begg-Mazumdar test reported no significant bias in the analysis of 
overall survival (p > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study concludes that MAP3K1 gene rs889312 polymorphism 
plays a prognostic role in the survival of cancer patients. However, future 
research is recommended that will analyze more MAP3K SNPs along with rs889312, 
which may reveal more credible outcomes in terms of cancer prognosis."
865,"The aim of this paper was to explore the role and mechanism of circHIPK3 in 
unexplained recurrent spontaneous abortion (URSA). The expression of circHIPK3 
and miR-30a-3p mRNA in URSA villous tissues was detected by quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction. The effects of circHIPK3 on the proliferation and 
migration of villous trophoblasts were analysed by MTTassay and scratch assay. 
Hoechst/PI staining was used to detect the effect of circHIPK3 on villous 
trophoblast apoptosis. The binding of circHIPK3 to miR-30a-3p and miR-30a-3p to 
Wnt2 was analysed by dual-luciferase assay. When URSA occurred, the expression 
level of circHIPK3 was downregulated, while the expression level of miR-30a-3p 
was upregulated in villous trophoblasts. Inhibition of circHIPK3 in villous 
trophoblasts can reduce the proliferation and migration of villous trophoblasts 
while promoting their apoptosis. The dual-luciferase assay showed that circHIPK3 
was able to interact with miR-30a-3p and increased the miR-30a-3p expression 
after inhibition of circHIPK3, and if miR-30a-3p was also inhibited it was able 
to reverse the effect of circHIPK3 on villous trophoblast proliferation and 
migration. It was demonstrated by prediction and dual-luciferase assay that 
miR-30a-3p binds to Wnt2, and when miR-30a-3p and Wnt2 are inhibited 
simultaneously, it has an inhibitory effect on the proliferation and migration 
process of villous trophoblasts. Downregulation of circHIPK3 expression in URSA 
leads to increased expression of miR-30a-3p, which in turn inhibits the 
expression of target gene Wnt2 and exerts a weakening effect on the 
proliferation and migration process of trophoblasts, thereby decreasing 
trophoblast invasiveness and shallow placental implantation, which in turn leads 
to recurrent spontaneous abortion."
866,"Pediatric restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is the rarest in its group and 
accounts for only 2.5-5% of all the diagnosed cardiomyopathies in children. It 
is a relentless disease with poor prognosis, and heart transplantation is the 
only long-term treatment option. The aetiology of pediatric RCM varies and 
includes conditions such as endomyocardial fibrosis, storage disorder (Fabry's 
disease, MPS), drugs, radiation, post-cardiac transplantation and genetic. 
Genetic causes encompasses mutations in sarcomeric (troponin I and T, actin, 
myosin and titin) and nonsarcomeric protein-coding genes (Desmin, RSK2, lamin 
A/C and bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3)). Inheritance of RCM could be 
autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked. Here, we report a case of 
RCM in an adolescent girl, who was symptomatic with palpitations and 
breathlessness on exertion. The patient showed presence of rare variants in FLNC 
(c.5707G>A; p.Glu1903Lys) and BAG3 genes (c.610G>A; p.Gly204Arg). These two 
variants were detected individually in asymptomatic father and mother, 
respectively. FLNC gene codes for gamma filamin. These filamin proteins play 
important role in maintaining the structural integrity of the sarcomere. BAG3 is 
the main component of the chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA) pathway. 
Mutant FLNC leads to the formation of protein aggregates which are cleared by an 
active protein quality control system including CASA pathway. For further 
verification, in silico protein-protein interaction was performed using online 
software and tools. The results showed evident interaction between FLNC and BAG3 
with significant binding score (-826.6) between them."
867,"Cholesteatoma of the middle ear is a common disease in otolaryngology that is 
receiving increasing attention. It is estimated that over 5 million people 
around the world are suffering from middle ear cholesteatoma. The yearly 
frequency of middle ear cholesteatoma is detailed as 9.2 per 100,000 in adults 
and 3 per 100,000 in children. Without timely discovery and intervention, 
cholesteatomas can become perilously large and attack intratemporal structures, 
coming about in various intra- and extracranial complications. So far, no 
practical nonsurgical treatments are available. Although multiple hypotheses 
exist, research directions are relatively consistent, focusing on cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, and bone destruction. Recently, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) 
especially miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, have received increasing attention 
because of their key roles in gene expression, cell cycle regulation, and the 
development of many diseases. Although ncRNAs are not involved in protein 
translation, they are abundant in the genome, with only approximately 2% of 
genes encoding proteins and the remaining approximately 98% encoding ncRNA. The 
purpose of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding 
the specific role of ncRNA in middle ear cholesteatoma."
868,"Information on rotavirus C (RVC) infection is lacking, partly because the 
prevalence of RVC among humans and animals worldwide is undefined. Data on the 
characteristics of the P genotype among RVC strains are also required. We 
performed systematic searches on the infection rates of RVC since 1980 based on 
the literature and gene sequences of the PubMed and GenBank databases. A 
phylogenetic tree of VP4 genes was constructed to evaluate the distribution of 
the P genotype of RVC from various hosts. The specific mutation motifs in VP8* 
with P [2]/P [4]/P [5] specificity were analyzed to elucidate their roles in 
host range restriction. The rate of RVC infection in humans has fallen from 3% 
before 2009 to 1%, whereas in animals it has risen from 10% to 25%. The P 
genotype of RVC showed strict host species specificity, and current human RVC 
infections are exclusively caused by genotype P [2]. In the VP8* hemagglutinin 
domain of the P [4]/P [5] genotype of swine RVC, specific insertion or deletion 
were found relative to the human P [2] genotype, and these motifs are a possible 
critical factor for host range restriction. Our findings highlight the need for 
further epidemiological surveillance, preventive strategies, and elucidation of 
the factors involved in the specific host range restriction of RVC-circulating 
strains."
869,"The incidence of high-risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV)-driven head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is on the rise globally. HR-HPV-driven HNSCC 
displays molecular and clinical characteristics distinct from HPV-uninvolved 
cases. Therapeutic strategies for HR-HPV-driven HNSCC are under investigation. 
HR-HPVs encode the oncogenes E6 and E7, which are essential in tumorigenesis. 
Meanwhile, involvement of E6 and E7 provides attractive targets for developing 
new therapeutic regimen. Here we will review some of the recent advancements 
observed in preclinical studies and clinical trials on HR-HPV-driven HNSCC, 
focusing on nanotechnology related methods. Materials science innovation leads 
to great improvement for cancer therapeutics including HNSCC. This article 
discusses HPV-E6 or -E7- based vaccines, based on plasmid, messenger RNA or 
peptide, at their current stage of development and testing as well as how 
nanoparticles can be designed to target and access cancer cells and activate 
certain immunology pathways besides serving as a delivery vehicle. 
Nanotechnology was also used for chemotherapy and photothermal treatment. Short 
interference RNA targeting E6/E7 showed some potential in animal models. Gene 
editing by CRISPR-CAS9 combined with other treatments has also been assessed. 
These advancements have the potential to improve the outcome in HR-HPV-driven 
HNSCC, however breakthroughs are still to be awaited with nanomedicine playing 
an important role."
870,"Tomato is an important vegetable in the United States and around the world. 
Recently, tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), an emerging tobamovirus, has 
impacted tomato crops worldwide and can result in fruit loss. ToBRFV causes 
severe symptoms, such as mosaic, puckering, and necrotic lesions on leaves; 
other symptoms include brown rugose and marbling on fruits. More importantly, 
ToBRFV can overcome resistance in tomato cultivars carrying the Tm-22 locus. In 
this study, we recovered ToBRFV sequences from tomato seeds, leaves, and fruits 
from the U.S., Mexico, and Peru. Samples were pre-screened using a real-time 
RT-PCR assay prior to high-throughput sequencing. Virus draft genomes from 22 
samples were assembled and analyzed against more than 120 publicly available 
genomes. Overall, most sequenced isolates were similar to each other and did not 
form a distinct population. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three clades within 
the ToBRFV population. Most of the isolates (95%) clustered in clade 3. Genetic 
analysis revealed differentiation between the three clades indicating minor 
divergence occurring. Overall, pairwise identity showed limited genetic 
diversity among the isolates in this study with worldwide isolates, with a 
pairwise identity ranging from 99.36% and 99.97%. The overall population is 
undergoing high gene flow and population expansion with strong negative 
selection pressure at all ToBRFV genes. Based on the results of this study, it 
is likely that the limited ToBRFV diversity is associated with the rapid 
movement and eradication of ToBRFV-infected material between countries."
871,"Viruses are strict intracellular parasites that rely on the proteins encoded in 
their genomes for the effective manipulation of the infected cell that 
ultimately enables a successful infection. Viral proteins have to be produced 
during the cell invasion and takeover in sufficient amounts and in a timely 
manner. Silencing suppressor proteins evolved by plant viruses can boost the 
production of viral proteins; although, additional mechanisms for the regulation 
of viral protein production likely exist. The strongest silencing suppressor 
encoded by the geminivirus tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is V2: V2 
suppresses both post-transcriptional and transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS 
and TGS), activities that are associated with its localization in punctate 
cytoplasmic structures and in the nucleus, respectively. However, V2 has been 
previously described to largely localize in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 
although the biological relevance of this distribution remains mysterious. Here, 
we confirm the association of V2 to the ER in Nicotiana benthamiana and assess 
the silencing suppression activity-independent impact of V2 on protein 
accumulation. Our results indicate that V2 has no obvious influence on the 
localization of ER-synthesized receptor-like kinases (RLKs) or ER quality 
control (ERQC)/ER-associated degradation (ERAD), but dramatically enhances the 
accumulation of the viral C4 protein, which is co-translationally myristoylated, 
possibly in proximity to the ER. By using the previously described V2C84S/86S 
mutant, in which the silencing suppression activity is abolished, we uncouple 
RNA silencing from the observed effect. Therefore, this work uncovers a novel 
function of V2, independent of its capacity to suppress silencing, in the 
promotion of the accumulation of another crucial viral protein."
872,"BACKGROUND: Combination therapy has been widely explored for oncolytic virus 
(OV), as it can be met with tumor resistance. The HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) 
panobinostat is a potent pan-deacetylase inhibitor which blocks multiple 
cancer-related pathways and reverses epigenetic events in cancer progression.
METHODS: In this study, oncolytic activity in vitro and antitumor therapeutic 
efficacy in vivo when combined with oHSV and panobinostat were investigated.
RESULTS: (1) Treatment with panobinostat enhanced oHSV propagation and 
cytotoxicity in human glioma A172 and squamous cell carcinoma SCC9 cells. (2) 
Combined treatment with oHSV and panobinostat enhanced virus replication 
mediated by the transcriptional downregulation of IFN-β- and IFN-responsive 
antiviral genes in human glioma A172 and squamous cell carcinoma SCC9 cells. (3) 
Panobinostat treatment induced upregulation of PD-L1 expression in both glioma 
and squamous cell carcinoma cells. (4) A significantly enhanced therapeutic 
efficacy was shown in vivo for the murine glioma CT-2A and squamous cell 
carcinoma SCC7 models when treated with a combination of oHSV, including 
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and HDAC inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, these data provide some new clues for the clinical 
development of combination therapy with OVs, epigenetic modifiers, and 
checkpoint blockades for glioma and squamous cell carcinoma."
873,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-associated neurodegenerative disorder 
(HAND) is frequently reported in HIV-infected individuals. The gp120 envelope 
viral protein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HAND in HIV-1-infected 
patients; however, its pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we 
first overexpressed gp120 proteins in pc12 cells and used PI staining, a CCK8 
assay, a TUNEL assay, and caspase-9/caspase-3-induced apoptosis to ascertain the 
mediated cell death. Subsequently, the gp120-overexpressed cells were subjected 
to RNA transcriptomics and mass spectrometry. The obtained results were 
integrated and validated using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) 
and the postmortem brain samples with HIV-associated dementia were analyzed 
against the normal control (using the GSE35864 data set on gene ontology omnibus 
repository). Upon the integration of the RNA transcriptomic and proteomic 
results, 78 upregulated genes were revealed. Fut8, Unc13c, Cdk1, Loc100359539, 
and Hspa2 were the top five upregulated genes. Upon the analysis of the GSE35864 
data set, the results indicate that Cdk1 was upregulated in HIV-associated 
dementia in comparison to the normal control. Moreover, the protein expression 
of Cdk1 was significantly higher in the gp120 transfected group compared to the 
normal control and decreased significantly upon inhibition using Roscovitine (a 
known Cdk1 inhibitor). Taken together, our results provide a possible molecular 
signature of the neurological impairment secondary to HIV glycoprotein 120."
874,"The inhibitor of virus replication (IVR) is an inducible protein that is not 
virus-target-specific and can be induced by several viruses. The GenBank was 
interrogated for sequences closely related to the tobacco IVR. Various RNA 
fragments from tobacco, tomato, and potato and their genomic DNA contained 
IVR-like sequences. However, IVRs were part of larger proteins encoded by these 
genomic DNA sequences, which were identified in Arabidopsis as being related to 
the cyclosome protein designated anaphase-promoting complex 7 (APC7). Sequence 
analysis of the putative APC7s of nine plant species showed proteins of 558-561 
amino acids highly conserved in sequence containing at least six protein-binding 
elements of 34 amino acids called tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), which form 
helix-turn-helix structures. The structures of Arabidopsis APC7 and the tobacco 
IVR proteins were modeled using the AlphaFold program and superimposed, showing 
that IVR had the same structure as the C-terminal 34% of APC7, indicating that 
IVR was a product of the APC7 gene. Based on the presence of various 
transcription factor binding sites in the APC7 sequences upstream of the IVR 
coding sequences, we propose that IVR could be expressed by these APC7 gene 
sequences involving the transcription factor SHE1."
875,"Baculoviruses have been widely used as expression vectors. However, numerous 
genes in the baculoviral genome are non-essential for cellular infection and 
protein expression, making the optimisation of baculovirus expression vectors 
possible. We used a synthetic biological method to reduce the number of genes in 
a partial region of the autograph californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 
(AcMNPV), the most widely used baculovirus expression vector. The C1 region of 
the AcMNPV is 46.4 kb and is subdivided into B1, B2, and B3 fragments. We first 
designed modified B1, B2, and B3 fragments by deleting the non-essential genes, 
and then synthesised complete viral genomes containing either individual 
modified B fragments or joint modified B fragments through 
transformation-related recombination in yeast. The synthetic genomes were then 
transfected into Sf9 cells to rescue the progeny viruses and test their 
infectivity. The design-build-test cycle was repeated until the ultimately 
rescued virus could produce progeny viruses efficiently. Finally, 
AcMNPV-Syn-mC1-1.1 by deleting approximately 17.2 kb, including 20 ORFs, in the 
C1 region, was obtained. This is essential to the synthesis of a minimal AcMNPV 
genome that can generate infectious progeny viruses and can be further used to 
optimise the foundation of baculovirus expression vectors."
876,"Genetic analysis of intra-host viral populations provides unique insight into 
pre-emergent mutations that may contribute to the genotype of future variants. 
Clinical samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 collected in California during the 
first months of the pandemic were sequenced to define the dynamics of mutation 
emergence as the virus became established in the state. Deep sequencing of 90 
nasopharyngeal samples showed that many mutations associated with the 
establishment of SARS-CoV-2 globally were present at varying frequencies in a 
majority of the samples, even those collected as the virus was first detected in 
the US. A subset of mutations that emerged months later in consensus sequences 
were detected as subconsensus members of intra-host populations. Spike mutations 
P681H, H655Y, and V1104L were detected prior to emergence in variant genotypes, 
mutations were detected at multiple positions within the furin cleavage site, 
and pre-emergent mutations were identified in the nucleocapsid and the envelope 
genes. Because many of the samples had a very high depth of coverage, a 
bioinformatics pipeline, ""Mappgene"", was established that uses both iVar and 
LoFreq variant calling to enable identification of very low-frequency variants. 
This enabled detection of a spike protein deletion present in many samples at 
low frequency and associated with a variant of concern."
877,"Epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), defined by co-infection with Human Herpes Virus 
8 (HHV-8) and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), is a major cause of 
mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly 
reduces the risk of developing KS, and for those with KS, tumors frequently 
resolve with ART alone. However, for unknown reasons, a significant number of KS 
cases do not resolve and can progress to death. To explore how HIV responds to 
ART in the KS tumor microenvironment, we sequenced HIV env-nef found in DNA and 
RNA isolated from plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and tumor 
biopsies, before and after ART, in four Ugandan study participants who had 
unresponsive or progressive KS after 180-250 days of ART. We performed 
immunohistochemistry experiments to detect viral proteins in matched 
formalin-fixed tumor biopsies. Our sequencing results showed that HIV diversity 
and RNA expression in KS tumors are maintained after ART, despite undetectable 
plasma viral loads. The presence of spliced HIV transcripts in KS tumors after 
ART was consistent with a transcriptionally active viral reservoir. 
Immunohistochemistry staining found colocalization of HIV Nef protein and 
tissue-resident macrophages in the KS tumors. Overall, our results demonstrated 
that even after ART reduced plasma HIV viral load to undetectable levels and 
restored immune function, HIV in KS tumors continues to be transcriptionally and 
translationally active, which could influence tumor maintenance and progression."
878,"Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are particles containing defective viral 
genomes (DVGs) generated during viral replication. DIPs have been found in 
various RNA viruses, especially in influenza viruses. Evidence indicates that 
DIPs interfere with the replication and encapsulation of wild-type viruses, 
namely standard viruses (STVs) that contain full-length viral genomes. DIPs may 
also activate the innate immune response by stimulating interferon synthesis. In 
this review, the underlying generation mechanisms and characteristics of 
influenza virus DIPs are summarized. We also discuss the potential impact of 
DIPs on the immunogenicity of live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) and 
development of influenza vaccines based on NS1 gene-defective DIPs. Finally, we 
review the antiviral strategies based on influenza virus DIPs that have been 
used against both influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. This review provides 
systematic insights into the theory and application of influenza virus DIPs."
879,"Clostridioides difficile causes antibiotic-induced diarrhoea and 
pseudomembranous colitis in humans and animals. Current conventional treatment 
relies solely on antibiotics, but C. difficile infection (CDI) cases remain 
persistently high with concomitant increased recurrence often due to the 
emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Antibiotics used in treatment also 
induce gut microbial imbalance; therefore, novel therapeutics with improved 
target specificity are being investigated. Bacteriophages (phages) kill bacteria 
with precision, hence are alternative therapeutics for the targeted eradication 
of the pathogen. Here, we review current progress in C. difficile phage 
research. We discuss tested strategies of isolating C. difficile phages 
directly, and via enrichment methods from various sample types and through 
antibiotic induction to mediate prophage release. We also summarise phenotypic 
phage data that reveal their morphological, genetic diversity, and various ways 
they impact their host physiology and pathogenicity during infection and 
lysogeny. Furthermore, we describe the therapeutic development of phages through 
efficacy testing in different in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo infection models. We 
also discuss genetic modification of phages to prevent horizontal gene transfer 
and improve lysis efficacy and formulation to enhance stability and delivery of 
the phages. The goal of this review is to provide a more in-depth understanding 
of C. difficile phages and theoretical and practical knowledge on pre-clinical, 
therapeutic evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of phage therapy for CDI."
880,"Older adults experience declining influenza vaccine-induced immunity and are at 
higher risk of influenza and its complications. For this reason, high dose 
(e.g., Fluzone) and adjuvanted (e.g., Fluad) vaccines are preferentially 
recommended for people age 65 years and older. However, T cell transcriptional 
activity shaping the humoral immune responses to Fluzone and Fluad vaccines in 
older adults is still poorly understood. We designed a study of 234 older adults 
(≥65 years old) who were randomly allocated to receive Fluzone or Fluad vaccine 
and provided blood samples at baseline and at Day 28 after immunization. We 
measured the humoral immune responses (hemagglutination inhibition/HAI antibody 
titer) to influenza A/H3N2 and performed mRNA-Seq transcriptional profiling in 
purified CD4+ T cells, in order to identify T cell signatures that might explain 
differences in humoral immune response by vaccine type. Given the large 
differences in formulation (higher antigen dose vs adjuvant), our hypothesis was 
that each vaccine elicited a distinct transcriptomic response after vaccination. 
Thus, the main focus of our study was to identify the differential gene 
expression influencing the antibody titer in the two vaccine groups. Our 
analyses identified three differentially expressed, functionally linked 
genes/proteins in CD4+ T cells: the calcium/calmodulin dependent 
serine/threonine kinase IV (CaMKIV); its regulator the TMEM38B/transmembrane 
protein 38B, involved in maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ release; and the 
transcriptional coactivator CBP/CREB binding protein, as regulators of 
transcriptional activity/function in CD4+ T cells that impact differences in 
immune response by vaccine type. Significantly enriched T cell-specific 
pathways/biological processes were also identified that point to the importance 
of genes/proteins involved in Th1/Th2 cell differentiation, IL-17 signaling, 
calcium signaling, Notch signaling, MAPK signaling, and regulation of TRP cation 
Ca2+ channels in humoral immunity after influenza vaccination. In summary, we 
identified the genes/proteins and pathways essential for cell activation and 
function in CD4+ T cells that are associated with differences in influenza 
vaccine-induced humoral immunity by vaccine type. These findings provide an 
additional mechanistic perspective for achieving protective immunity in older 
adults."
881,"Cancer induced by a viral infection is among the leading causes of cancer. 
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a hepatotropic oncogenic positive-sense RNA virus 
that leads to chronic infection, exposing the liver to a continuous process of 
damage and regeneration and promoting hepatocarcinogenesis. The virus promotes 
the development of carcinogenesis through indirect and direct molecular 
mechanisms such as chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, steatosis, genetic 
alterations, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, proliferation, and apoptosis, 
among others. Recently, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) showed sustained 
virologic response in 95% of cases. Nevertheless, patients treated with DAAs 
have reported an unexpected increase in the early incidence of Hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC). Studies suggest that HCV induces epigenetic regulation through 
non-coding RNAs, DNA methylation, and chromatin remodeling, which modify gene 
expressions and induce genomic instability related to HCC development that 
persists with the infection's clearance. The need for a better understanding of 
the molecular mechanisms associated with the development of carcinogenesis is 
evident. The aim of this review was to unravel the molecular pathways involved 
in the development of carcinogenesis before, during, and after the viral 
infection's resolution, and how these pathways were regulated by the virus, to 
find control points that can be used as potential therapeutic targets."
882,"Culex spp. mosquitoes transmit several pathogens concerning public health, 
including West Nile virus and Saint Louis encephalitis virus. Understanding the 
antiviral immune system of Culex spp. mosquitoes is important for reducing the 
transmission of these viruses. Mosquitoes rely on RNA interference (RNAi) to 
control viral replication. While the siRNA pathway in mosquitoes is heavily 
studied, less is known about the piRNA pathway. The piRNA pathway in mosquitoes 
has recently been connected to mosquito antiviral immunity. In Aedes aegypti, 
Piwi4 has been implicated in antiviral responses. The antiviral role of the 
piRNA pathway in Culex spp. mosquitoes is understudied compared to Ae. aegypti. 
Here, we aimed to identify the role of PIWI genes and piRNAs in Culex 
quinquefasciatus and Culex tarsalis cells during virus infection. We examined 
the effect of PIWI gene silencing on virus replication of two arboviruses and 
three insect-specific viruses in Cx. quinquefasciatus derived cells (Hsu) and 
Cx. tarsalis derived (CT) cells. We show that Piwi4 is antiviral against the La 
Crosse orthobunyavirus (LACV) in Hsu and CT cells, and the insect-specific 
rhabdovirus Merida virus (MERDV) in Hsu cells. None of the silenced PIWI genes 
impacted replication of the two flaviviruses Usutu virus (USUV) and Calbertado 
virus, or the phasivirus Phasi-Charoen-like virus. We further used small RNA 
sequencing to determine that LACV-derived piRNAs, but not USUV-derived piRNAs 
were generated in Hsu cells and that PIWI gene silencing resulted in a small 
reduction in vpiRNAs. Finally, we determined that LACV-derived DNA was produced 
in Hsu cells during infection, but whether this viral DNA is required for vpiRNA 
production remains unclear. Overall, we expanded our knowledge on the piRNA 
pathway and how it relates to the antiviral response in Culex spp mosquitoes."
883,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genera alphacoronavirus, 
causes acute watery diarrhea and dehydration in suckling piglets and results in 
enormous economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. Identification and 
characterization of different cell lines are not only invaluable for PEDV entry 
and replication studies but also important for the development of various types 
of biological pharmaceuticals against PEDV. In this study, we present an 
approach to identify suitable permissive cell lines for PEDV research. Human 
cell lines were screened for a high correlation coefficient with the established 
PEDV infection model Huh7 based on RNA-seq data from the Cancer Cell Line 
Encyclopedia (CCLE). Experimentally testing permissiveness towards PEDV 
infection, three highly permissive human cell lines, HepG2, Hep3B217, and SNU387 
were identified. The replication kinetics of PEDV in HepG2, Hep3B217, and SNU387 
cells were similar to that in Vero and Huh7 cells. Additionally, the 
transcriptomes analysis showed robust induction of transcripts associated with 
the innate immune in response to PEDV infection in all three cell lines, 
including hundreds of inflammatory cytokine and interferon genes. Moreover, the 
expression of inflammatory cytokines and interferons were confirmed by qPCR 
assay. Our findings indicate that HepG2, Hep3B217, and SNU387 are suitable cell 
lines for PEDV replication and innate immune response studies."
884,"Because of the interface between coagulation and the immune response, it is 
expected that COVID-19-associated coagulopathy occurs via activated protein C 
signaling. The objective was to explore putative changes in the expression of 
the protein C signaling network in the liver, peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells, and nasal epithelium of patients with COVID-19. Single-cell 
RNA-sequencing data from patients with COVID-19 and healthy subjects were 
obtained from the COVID-19 Cell Atlas database. A functional protein-protein 
interaction network was constructed for the protein C gene. Patients with 
COVID-19 showed downregulation of protein C and components of the downstream 
protein C signaling cascade. The percentage of hepatocytes expressing protein C 
was lower. Part of the liver cell clusters expressing protein C presented 
increased expression of ACE2. In PBMC, there was increased ACE2, inflammatory, 
and pro-coagulation transcripts. In the nasal epithelium, PROC, ACE2, and PROS1 
were expressed by the ciliated cell cluster, revealing co-expression of ACE-2 
with transcripts encoding proteins belonging to the coagulation and immune 
system interface. Finally, there was upregulation of coagulation factor 3 
transcript in the liver and PBMC. Protein C could play a mechanistic role in the 
hypercoagulability syndrome affecting patients with severe COVID-19."
885,"Bats carry thousands of viruses from 28 different families. To determine the 
presence of various pathogens in bat populations in Kazakhstan, 1149 samples 
(393 oropharyngeal swabs, 349 brain samples, 407 guano) were collected. The 
samples were collected from four species of bats (Vespertilio murinus, Nyctalus 
noctula, Myotis blythii, Eptesicus serotinus) in nine regions. The Coronavirus 
RNA was found in 38 (4.75%) samples, and the rabies virus in 27 (7.74%) samples 
from bats. Coronaviruses and the rabies virus were found in bats in six out of 
nine studied areas. The RNAs of SARS-CoV-2, MERS, TBE, CCHF, WNF, influenza A 
viruses were not detected in the bat samples. The phylogeny of the RdRp gene of 
12 samples made it possible to classify them as alphacoronaviruses and divide 
them into two groups. The main group (n = 11) was closely related to bat 
coronaviruses from Ghana, Zimbabwe and Kenya. The second group (n = 1) was 
closely related to viruses previously isolated in the south of Kazakhstan. The 
phylogeny of the N gene sequence from a bat from west Kazakhstan revealed its 
close relationship with isolates from the Cosmopolitan group of rabies viruses 
(Central Asia). These results highlight the need for a continuous monitoring of 
volatile populations to improve the surveillance and detection of infectious 
diseases."
886,"The H9N2 subtype of avian influenza virus (AIV) has been reported to infect not 
only birds, but also humans. The hemagglutinin (HA) protein is the main surface 
antigen of AIV and plays an important role in the viral infection. For treatment 
strategies and vaccine development, HA protein has been an important target for 
the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza A virus. To 
investigate the vital target determinant cluster in HA protein in this work, HA 
gene was cloned and expressed in the prokaryotic expression vector pET28a. The 
spleen lymphocytes from BALC/c mice immunized with the purified recombinant HA 
protein were fused with SP2/0 cells. After Hypoxanthine-Aminopterin-Thymidine 
(HAT) medium screening and indirect ELISA detection, six hybridoma cell lines 
producing anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were screened. The gradually truncated 
HA gene expression and western blotting were used to identify their major 
locations in epitopes specific to these monoclonal antibodies. It was found that 
the epitopes were located in three areas: 112NVENLEEL119, 117EELRSLFS124, and 
170PIQDAQ175. Epitope 112NVENLEEL119 has a partial amino acid crossover with 
117EELRSLFS124, which is located in the vestigial esterase domain ""110-helix"" of 
HA, and the monoclonal antibody recognizing these epitopes showed the 
neutralizing activity, suggesting that the region 112NVENLEELRSLFS124 might be a 
novel neutralizing epitope. The results of the homology analysis showed that 
these three epitopes were generally conserved in H9N2 subtype AIV, and will 
provide valuable insights into H9N2 vaccine design and improvement, as well as 
antibody-based therapies for treatment of H9N2 AIV infection."
887,"Aeromonas popoffii is one of the environmental Aeromonas species. A number of 
factors of virulence have been described for this species and it has been 
reported as a causative agent of urinary tract infection. The first A. popoffii 
bacteriophage AerP_220 along with its host strain A. popoffii CEMTC 4062 were 
isolated from river water. The phage has a podovirus morphotype, shows a narrow 
host range and is lytic against the host strain. The AerP_220 genome comprises 
45,207 bp and does not contain genes responsible for antibiotic resistance and 
toxin production. Fifty-nine co-directional putative ORFs were found in the 
AerP_220 genome. Thirty-three ORFs encoded proteins with predicted functions; 
the products of 26 ORFs were hypothetical proteins. AerP_220 genome analysis 
revealed that this phage can be considered a novel species within the 
Autographiviridae family. Comparative genomic and proteomic analysis revealed 
that AerP_220 along with the Aeromonas phage vB_AspA_Tola (OM913599) are members 
of a new putative Tolavirus genus in the family Autographiviridae. The 
Gajwadongvirus and proposed Tolavirus genera along with Pantoea phage Nufs112 
and phage Reminis could form a new Tolavirinae subfamily within the 
Autographiviridae family."
888,"An adenoviral (AdV)-based vector system is a promising platform for vaccine 
development and gene therapy applications. Administration of an AdV vector 
elicits robust innate immunity, leading to the development of humoral and 
cellular immune responses against the vector and the transgene antigen, if 
applicable. The use of high doses (1011-1013 virus particles) of an AdV vector, 
especially for gene therapy applications, could lead to vector toxicity due to 
excessive levels of innate immune responses, vector interactions with blood 
factors, or high levels of vector transduction in the liver and spleen. 
Additionally, the high prevalence of AdV infections in humans or the first 
inoculation with the AdV vector result in the development of vector-specific 
immune responses, popularly known as preexisting vector immunity. It 
significantly reduces the vector efficiency following the use of an AdV vector 
that is prone to preexisting vector immunity. Several approaches have been 
developed to overcome this problem. The utilization of rare human AdV types or 
nonhuman AdVs is the primary strategy to evade preexisting vector immunity. The 
use of heterologous viral vectors, capsid modification, and vector encapsulation 
are alternative methods to evade vector immunity. The vectors can be optimized 
for clinical applications with comprehensive knowledge of AdV vector immunity, 
toxicity, and circumvention strategies."
889,"Globodera pallida, a potato cyst nematode (PCN), is a quarantine endoparasitic 
pest of potato (Solanum tuberosum) in the US due to its effects on yield and 
quality of potato tubers. A new rhabdovirus, named potato cyst nematode 
rhabdovirus (PcRV), was revealed and characterized in the G. pallida populations 
collected in Idaho through use of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and RT-PCR 
and found to be most closely related to soybean cyst nematode rhabdovirus 
(ScRV). PcRV has a 13,604 bp long, single-stranded RNA genome encoding five open 
reading frames, including four rhabdovirus-specific genes, N, P, G, and L, and 
one unknown gene. PcRV was found present in eggs, invasive second-stage 
juveniles, and parasitic females of G. pallida, implying a vertical transmission 
mode. RT-PCR and partial sequencing of PcRV in laboratory-reared G. pallida 
populations maintained over five years suggested that the virus is highly 
persistent and genetically stable. Two other Globodera spp. reproducing on 
potato and reported in the US, G. rostochiensis and G. ellingtonae, tested 
negative for PcRV presence. To the best of our knowledge, PcRV is the first 
virus experimentally found infecting G. pallida. Based on their similar genome 
organizations, the phylogeny of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domains (L 
gene), and relatively high identity levels in their protein products, PcRV and 
ScRV are proposed to form a new genus, provisionally named ""Gammanemrhavirus"", 
within the family Rhabdoviridae."
890,"We have previously demonstrated that both the original γ-globin lentiviral 
vector (LV) GGHI and the optimized GGHI-mB-3D LV, carrying the novel regulatory 
elements of the 3D HPFH-1 enhancer and the 3' β-globin UTR, can significantly 
increase HbF production in thalassemic CD34+ cells and ameliorate the disease 
phenotype in vitro. In the present study, we investigated whether the GGHI-mB-3D 
vector can also exhibit an equally therapeutic effect, following the 
transduction of sickle cell disease (SCD) CD34+ cells at MOI 100, leading to HbF 
increase coupled with HbS decrease, and thus, to phenotype improvement in vitro. 
We show that GGHI-mB-3D LV can lead to high and potentially therapeutic HbF 
levels, reaching a mean 2-fold increase to a mean value of VCN/cell of 1.0 and a 
mean transduction efficiency of 55%. Furthermore, this increase was accompanied 
by a significant 1.6-fold HbS decrease, a beneficial therapeutic feature for 
SCD. In summary, our data demonstrate the efficacy of the optimized γ-globin 
lentiviral vector to improve the SCD phenotype in vitro, and highlights its 
potential use in future clinical SCD trials."
891,"Despite decades of focus on crickets (family: Gryllidae) as a popular commodity 
and model organism, we still know very little about their immune responses to 
microbial pathogens. Previous studies have measured downstream immune effects 
(e.g., encapsulation response, circulating hemocytes) following an immune 
challenge in crickets, but almost none have identified and quantified the 
expression of immune genes during an active pathogenic infection. Furthermore, 
the prevalence of covert (i.e., asymptomatic) infections within insect 
populations is becoming increasingly apparent, yet we do not fully understand 
the mechanisms that maintain low viral loads. In the present study, we measured 
the expression of several genes across multiple immune pathways in Gryllodes 
sigillatus crickets with an overt or covert infection of cricket iridovirus 
(CrIV). Crickets with overt infections had higher relative expression of key 
pathway component genes across the Toll, Imd, Jak/STAT, and RNAi pathways. These 
results suggests that crickets can tolerate low viral infections but can mount a 
robust immune response during an overt CrIV infection. Moreover, this study 
provides insight into the immune strategy of crickets following viral infection 
and will aid future studies looking to quantify immune investment and improve 
resistance to pathogens."
892,"(1) Background: Vaccination of horses and sheep against Borna disease (BD) was 
common in endemic areas of Germany in the 20th century but was abandoned in the 
early 1990s. The recent occurrence of fatal cases of human encephalitis due to 
Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) has rekindled the interest in vaccination. (2) 
Methods: The full genomes of the BD live vaccine viruses ""Dessau"" and ""Giessen"" 
were sequenced and analyzed for the first time. All vaccination experiments 
followed a proof-of-concept approach. Dose-titration infection experiments were 
performed in rabbits, based on both cell culture- and brain-derived viruses at 
various doses. Inactivated vaccines against BD were produced from concentrated 
cell culture supernatants and investigated in rabbits and horses. The BoDV-1 
live vaccine ""Dessau"" was administered to horses and antibody profiles were 
determined. (3) Results: The BD live vaccine viruses ""Dessau"" and ""Giessen"" 
belong to clusters 3 and 4 of BoDV-1. Whereas the ""Giessen"" virus does not 
differ substantially from field viruses, the ""Dessau"" virus shows striking 
differences in the M gene and the N-terminal part of the G gene. Rabbits 
infected with high doses of cell-cultured virus developed neutralizing 
antibodies and were protected from disease, whereas rabbits infected with low 
doses of cell-cultured virus, or with brain-derived virus did not. Inactivated 
vaccines were administered to rabbits and horses, following pre-defined 
vaccination schemes consisting of three vaccine doses of either adjuvanted or 
nonadjuvanted inactivated virus. Their immunogenicity and protective efficacy 
were compared to the BD live vaccine ""Dessau"". Seventy per cent of horses 
vaccinated with the BD live vaccine ""Dessau"" developed neutralizing antibodies 
after vaccination. (4) Conclusion: Despite a complex evasion of immunological 
responses by bornaviruses, some vaccination approaches can protect against 
clinical disease. For optimal effectiveness, vaccines should be administered at 
high doses, following vaccination schemes consisting of three vaccine doses as 
basic immunization. Further investigations are necessary in order to investigate 
and improve protection against infection and to avoid side effects."
893,"Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) is the most important pathogen 
threatening the aquaculture of salmonid fish in China. In addition to the common 
genogroup J IHNV, genogroup U has been newly discovered in China. However, there 
is no effective DNA vaccine to fight against this emerging genogroup U IHNV in 
China. In this study, DNA vaccines encoding the IHNV viral glycoprotein (G) gene 
of the GS2014 (genogroup J) and BjLL (genogroup U) strains isolated from 
northern China were successfully developed, which were identified by restriction 
analysis and IFA. The expression of the Mx-1 gene and G gene in the spleens and 
muscles of the injection site as well as the titers of the serum antibodies were 
measured to evaluate the vaccine efficacy by RT-qPCR and ELISA. We found that 
DNA vaccine immunization could activate Mx1 gene expression and upregulate G 
gene expression, and the mRNA levels of the Mx1 gene in the muscles were 
significantly higher than those in the spleens. Notably, DNA vaccine 
immunization might not promote the serum antibody in fish at the early stage of 
immunization. Furthermore, the efficacy of the constructed vaccines was tested 
in intra- and cross-genogroup challenges by a viral challenge in vivo. It seemed 
that the DNA vaccines were able to provide great immune protection against IHNV 
infection. In addition, the genogroup J IHNV-G DNA vaccine showed better immune 
efficacy than the genogroup U IHNV-G or divalent vaccine, which could provide 
cross-immune protection against the genogroup U IHNV challenge. Therefore, this 
is the first study to construct an IHNV DNA vaccine using the G gene from an 
emerging genogroup U IHNV strain in China. The results provide great insight 
into the advances of new prophylactic strategies to fight both the genogroup J 
and U IHNV in China."
894,"The Salmon gill poxvirus (SGPV) has emerged in recent years as the cause of an 
acute respiratory disease that can lead to high mortality in farmed Atlantic 
salmon presmolts, known as Salmon gill poxvirus disease. SGPV was first 
identified in Norway in the 1990s, and its large DNA genome, consisting of over 
206 predicted protein-coding genes, was characterized in 2015. This review 
summarizes current knowledge relating to disease manifestation and its effects 
on the host immune system and describes dissemination of the virus. It also 
demonstrates how newly established molecular tools can help us to understand 
SGPV and its pathogenesis. Finally, we conclude and ask some burning questions 
that should be addressed in future research."
895,"The family Herpesviridae includes viruses identified in mammals, birds and 
reptiles. All herpesviruses share a similar structure, consisting of a large 
linear double-stranded DNA genome surrounded by a proteic icosahedral capsid 
further contained within a lipidic bilayer envelope. The continuous rise of 
genetic variability and the evolutionary selective pressure underlie the 
appearance and consolidation of novel viral strains. This applies also to 
several gamma(γ)-herpesviruses, whose role as primary pathogen has been often 
neglected and, among these to newly emerged viruses or virus variants 
responsible for the development of Malignant Catarrhal Fever (MCF) or MCF-like 
disease. The identification of γ-herpesviruses adapted to new zoological hosts 
requires specific molecular tools for detection and characterization. These 
viruses can cause MCF in livestock and wild animals, a disease generally 
sporadic but with serious welfare implications and which, in many cases, leads 
to death within a few days from the appearance of the clinical signs. In the 
absence of a vaccine, the first step to improve disease control is based on the 
improvement of molecular tools to identify and characterize these viruses, their 
phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary interaction with the host species. A 
Panherpes PCR-specific test, based on the conserved DNA polymerase gene, 
employing consensus/degenerate and deoxyinosine-substituted primers followed by 
sequencing, is still the preferred diagnostic test to confirm and characterize 
herpesviral infections. The drawback of this test is the amplification of a 
relatively short sequence, which makes phylogenetic analysis less stringent. 
Based on these diagnostic requirements, and with a specific focus on 
γ-herpesviruses, the present review aims to critically analyze the currently 
available methods to identify and characterize novel MCFV strains, to highlight 
advantages and drawbacks and to identify the gaps to be filled in order to 
address research priorities. Possible approaches for improving or further 
developing these molecular tools are also suggested."
896,"Background: Exosomes are involved in intercellular communication and can 
transfer regulatory molecules between cells. Consequently, they can participate 
in host immune response regulation. For the influenza A virus (IAV), there is 
very limited information on changes in exosome composition during cell infection 
shedding light on the potential role of these extracellular membrane vesicles. 
Thus, the aim of our work was to study changes in exosomal composition following 
IAV infection of cells, as well as to evaluate their effect on uninfected cells. 
Methods: To characterize changes in the composition of cellular miRNAs and mRNAs 
of exosomes during IAV infection of A549 cells, NGS was used, as well as PCR to 
identify viral genes. Naïve A549 cells were stimulated with 
infected-cell-secreted exosomes for studying their activity. Changes in the 
expression of genes associated with the cell's immune response were shown using 
PCR. The effect of exosomes on IAV replication was shown in MDCK cells using 
In-Cell ELISA and PCR of the supernatants. Results: A change in the miRNA 
composition (miR-21-3p, miR-26a-5p, miR-23a-5p, miR-548c-5p) and mRNA 
composition (RPL13A, MKNK2, TRIB3) of exosomes under the influence of the IAV 
was shown. Many RNAs were involved in the regulation of the immune response of 
the cell, mainly by suppressing it. After exosome stimulation of naïve cells, a 
significant decrease in the expression of genes involved in the immune response 
was shown (RIG1, IFIT1, MDA5, COX2, NFκB, AnxA1, PKR, IL6, IL18). When infecting 
MDCK cells, a significant decrease in nucleoprotein levels was observed in the 
presence of exosomes secreted by mock-infected cells. Viral levels in 
supernatants also decreased. Conclusions: Exosomes secreted by IAV-infected 
cells could reduce the immune response of neighboring intact cells, leading to 
more effective IAV replication. This may be associated both with regulatory 
functions of cellular miRNAs and mRNAs carried by exosomes, or with the presence 
of viral mRNAs encoding proteins with an immunosuppressive function."
897,"The COVID-19 pandemic has modified the seasonal pattern of respiratory 
infections. The objective of the present study is to characterize the 
out-of-season circulation of influenza viruses and an influenza outbreak that 
occurred in southern Italy in August 2022. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from 
patients with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) were tested for the presence of 
influenza and other respiratory viruses. Epidemiological investigations on 85 
patients involved in an influenza outbreak were performed. Sequencing and 
phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin genes was undertaken on samples positive 
for influenza A. In August 2022, in the Apulia region (Italy), influenza A 
infection was diagnosed in 19 patients, 18 infected with A/H3N2 and one with 
A/H1N1pdm09 virus. Seven influenza-positive patients were hospitalized with ILI. 
A further 17 symptomatic subjects, associated with an influenza outbreak, were 
also tested; 11 were positive for influenza A/H3N2 virus. Phylogenetic analysis 
of 12 of the A/H3N2 sequences showed that they all belonged to subclade 
3C.2a1b.2a.2. The A/H1N1pdm09 strain belonged to subclade 6B.1A.5a.2. The 
out-of-season circulation of the influenza virus during the summer months could 
be linked to changing dynamics in the post-COVID-19 era, as well as to the 
impact of climate change. Year-round surveillance of respiratory viruses is 
needed to monitor this phenomenon and to provide effective prevention 
strategies."
898,"As for the case of SARS-CoV-2, genome sequencing of influenza viruses is of 
potential interest to raise and address virological issues. Recently, 
false-negativity of real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qPCR) assays that 
detect influenza A/H3N2 virus RNA were reported and associated with two 
mutations (A37T and C161T) in the Matrix-encoding (M1) gene located on viral 
segment 7. This triggered a national alert in France. The present study sought 
to assess the association between the presence of these mutations and potential 
false negative results of influenza A/H3N2 virus RNA detection by commercialized 
qPCR assays at the clinical virology laboratory of our university hospitals in 
southern France. This study focused on the genetic diversity in the M1 gene and 
segment 7 of 624 influenza A/H3N2 virus genomes obtained from respiratory 
samples having tested qPCR-positive with M1 gene-targeting assays in our 
clinical virology laboratory. A total of 585 among the 624 influenza A/H3N2 
virus genomes (93.7%) were of clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2, and 39 (6.3%) were of clade 
3C.2a1b.1a. M1 gene substitutions A37T and C161T were both present in 582 
(93.3%) genomes, only of clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2. Substitution A37T was present in 
621 (99.5%) genomes. Substitution C161T was present in 585 genomes (93.8%), all 
of clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2. Moreover, 21 other nucleotide positions were mutated in 
≥90% of the genomes. The present study shows that A37T/C and C161T mutations, 
and other mutations in the M1 gene and segment 7, were widely present in 
influenza A/H3N2 virus genomes recovered from respiratory samples diagnosed 
qPCR-positive with commercialized assays."
899,"Based on analyses of recent open-source data, this paper describes novel 
horizons in the diversity and taxonomy of beny-like viruses infecting hosts of 
the plant kingdom (Plantae or Archaeplastida). First, our data expand the known 
host range of the family Benyviridae to include red algae. Second, our 
phylogenetic analysis suggests that the evolution of this virus family may have 
involved cross-kingdom host change events and gene recombination/exchanges 
between distant taxa. Third, the identification of gene blocks encoding known 
movement proteins in beny-like RNA viruses infecting non-vascular plants 
confirms other evidence that plant virus genomic RNAs may have acquired movement 
proteins simultaneously or even prior to the evolutionary emergence of the plant 
vascular system. Fourth, novel data on plant virus diversity highlight that 
molecular evolution gave rise to numerous provisional species of 
land-plant-infecting viruses, which encode no known potential movement genetic 
systems."
900,"The cervical microbiota is essential in female sexual health, and its altered 
states seem to have a central role in the dynamic of high-risk papillomavirus 
(hrHPV) infections. This study aimed to evaluate the variation in bacterial 
communities' compositions according to hrHPV. We collected two samples per 
woman, with a difference of 12 ± 1 months between them, and performed a 
follow-up on 66 of these women. The viral load (VL) of the hrHPV was estimated 
by quantitative PCR (qPCR), then it was normalized (using the HMBS gene as 
reference) and transformed to the Log10 scale to facilitate the interpretation. 
The VL was categorized as Negative, without hrHPV copies; Low, less than 100 
hrHPV copies; Medium, between 100 to 102 hrHPV copies; and High, &gt;102 hrHPV 
copies. The microbiota composition was described through the Illumina Novaseq 
PE250 platform. The diversity analyses revealed changes regarding the hrHPV VL, 
where women with low VL (&lt;100 hrHPV copies) presented high diversity. The 
community state type (CST) IV was the most common. However, in women with high 
VL, a lower association with Lactobacillus depletion was found. Lactobacillus 
gallinarum and L. iners were the most abundant species in women with high VL, 
whereas women with low VL had a 6.06 greater probability of exhibiting 
Lactobacillus dominance. We identified conspicuous differences in the abundance 
of 78 bacterial genera between women with low and high VL, where 26 were 
depleted (e.g., Gardnerella) and 52 increased (e.g., Mycoplasma). A multilevel 
mixed-effects linear regression showed changes in the diversity due to the 
interaction between the measurement time and the VL, with a decrease in 
diversity in the second follow-up in women with low VL (Coeff. = 0.47), whereas 
the women with medium VL displayed an increase in diversity (Coeff. = 0.58). 
Here, we report for the first time that the cervical microbiota is influenced by 
the number of copies of hrHPV, where a decrease in the abundance of 
Lactobacillus, greater diversity, and enrichment of bacterial taxa is relevant 
in women with low VL."
901,"The tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes a most important viral 
life-threatening illness transmitted by ticks. The interactions between the 
virus and ticks are largely unexplored, indicating a lack of experimental tools 
and systematic studies. One such tool is recombinant reporter TBEV, offering 
antibody-free visualization to facilitate studies of transmission and 
interactions between a tick vector and a virus. In this paper, we utilized a 
recently developed recombinant TBEV expressing the reporter gene mCherry to 
study its fitness in various tick-derived in vitro cell cultures and live unfed 
nymphal Ixodes ricinus ticks. The reporter virus was successfully replicated in 
tick cell lines and live ticks as confirmed by the plaque assay and the 
mCherry-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Although a strong mCherry 
signal determined by fluorescence microscopy was detected in several tick cell 
lines, the fluorescence of the reporter was not observed in the live ticks, 
corroborated also by immunoblotting. Our data indicate that the mCherry reporter 
TBEV might be an excellent tool for studying TBEV-tick interactions using a tick 
in vitro model. However, physiological attributes of a live tick, likely 
contributing to the inactivity of the reporter, warrant further development of 
reporter-tagged viruses to study TBEV in ticks in vivo."
902,"The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is a widely used platform for 
recombinant protein production for use in a wide variety of applications. Of 
particular interest is production of virus-like particles (VLPs), which consist 
of multiple viral proteins that self-assemble in strict stoichiometric ratios to 
mimic the structure of a virus but lacks its genetic material, while a 
significant amount of effort has been spent on optimizing expression ratios by 
co-infecting cells with multiple recombinant BEVs and modulating different 
process parameters, co-expressing multiple foreign genes from a single rBEV may 
offer more promise. However, there is currently a lack of promoters available 
with which to optimize co-expression of each foreign gene. To address this, 
previously published transcriptome data was used to identify promoters that have 
incrementally lower expression profiles and compared by expressing model 
cytoplasmic and secreted proteins. Bioinformatics was also used to identify 
sequence determinants that may be important for late gene transcription 
regulation, and translation initiation. The identified promoters and 
bioinformatics analyses may be useful for optimizing expression of foreign genes 
in the BEVS."
903,"Recombination is the main driver of bacteriophage evolution. It may serve as a 
tool for extending the phage host spectrum, which is significant not only for 
phages' ecology but also for their utilisation as therapeutic agents of 
bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to detect the recombination 
events in the genomes of Litunavirus phages infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
and present their impact on phylogenetic relations within this phage group. The 
phylogenetic analyses involved: the whole-genome, core-genome (Schitoviridae 
conserved genes), variable genome region, and the whole-genome minus variable 
region. Interestingly, the recombination events taking place in the putative 
host recognition region (tail fibre protein gene and the adjacent downstream 
gene) significantly influenced tree topology, suggesting a strong phylogenetic 
signal. Our results indicate the recombination between phages from two genera 
Litunavirus and Luzeptimavirus and demonstrate its influence on phage phylogeny."
904,"A teleost's kidney was divided into head kidney and trunk kidney. The head 
kidney is an important lymphatic organ, while the trunk kidney mainly performs 
osmotic pressure regulation and excretion functions. Previous studies have shown 
that the teleost's head kidney exerts a strong immune response against pathogen 
invasion, while the mechanism of immune response in the trunk kidney is still 
rarely reported. Therefore, in this study, we established an Infectious 
hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) immersion infection model to compare the 
similarities and differences of immune response mechanisms between the head 
kidney and trunk kidney against viral infection. The results showed that IHNV 
infection causes severe tissue damage and inflammatory reaction in the head and 
trunk kidney, triggers a series of interferon cascade reactions, and produces 
strong immune response. In addition, the transcriptome data showed that the head 
kidney and trunk kidney had similar immune response mechanisms, which showed 
that the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling 
pathway were activated. In conclusion, despite functional differentiation, the 
teleost's trunk kidney still has a strong immune response, especially the 
interferon-stimulated genes, which have stronger immune response in the trunk 
kidney than in the head kidney when responding to IHNV infection. This study 
contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the teleost immune system 
and enriches the theory of kidney immunity in teleosts."
905,"Equine sarcoids are common, locally aggressive skin tumors induced by bovine 
papillomavirus types 1, 2, and possibly 13 (BPV1, BPV2, BPV13). Current in vitro 
models do not mimic de novo infection. We established primary fibroblasts from 
horse skin and succeeded in infecting these cells with native BPV1 and BPV2 
virions. Subsequent cell characterization was carried out by cell culture, 
immunological, and molecular biological techniques. Infection of fibroblasts 
with serial 10-fold virion dilutions (2 × 106-20 virions) uniformly led to DNA 
loads settling at around 150 copies/cell after four passages. Infected cells 
displayed typical features of equine sarcoid cells, including 
hyperproliferation, and loss of contact inhibition. Neither multiple passaging 
nor storage negatively affected cell hyperproliferation, viral DNA replication, 
and gene transcription, suggestive for infection-mediated cell immortalization. 
Intriguingly, extracellular vesicles released by BPV1-infected fibroblasts 
contained viral DNA that was most abundant in the fractions enriched for 
apoptotic bodies and exosomes. This viral DNA is likely taken up by non-infected 
fibroblasts. We conclude that equine primary fibroblasts stably infected with 
BPV1 and BPV2 virions constitute a valuable near-natural model for the study of 
yet unexplored mechanisms underlying the pathobiology of BPV1/2-induced 
sarcoids."
906,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity 
worldwide, since chronic HBV infection is associated with elevated risk of 
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current licensed therapies against HBV 
efficiently suppress viral replication; however, they do not have significant 
effects on the intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) of the viral 
minichromosome responsible for viral persistence. Thus, life-long treatment is 
required to avoid viral rebound. There is a significant need for novel therapies 
that can reduce, silence or eradicate cccDNA, thus preventing HBV reemergence 
after treatment withdrawal. In this review, we discuss the latest developments 
and applications of gene editing and related approaches for directly targeting 
HBV DNA and, more specifically, cccDNA in infected hepatocytes."
907,"Food contamination by Salmonella can lead to serious foodborne diseases that 
constantly threaten public health. Innovative and effective strategies are 
needed to control foodborne pathogenic contamination since the incidence of 
foodborne diseases has increased gradually. In the present study, two 
broad-spectrum phages named Salmonella phage PSE-D1 and Salmonella phage PST-H1 
were isolated from sewage in China. Phages PSE-D1 and PST-H1 were obtained by 
enrichment with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. 
Enteritidis) CVCC1806 and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar 
Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) CVCC3384, respectively. They were able to lyse 
Salmonella, E. coli and K. pneumoniae and exhibited broad host range. Further 
study demonstrated that PSE-D1 and PST-H1 showed high pH and thermal tolerances. 
Phage PSE-D1 belongs to the Jiaodavirus genus, Tevenvirinae subfamily, while 
phage PST-H1 belongs to the Jerseyvirus genus, Guernseyvirinae subfamily 
according to morphology and phylogeny. The results of genome analysis showed 
that PSE-D1 and PST-H1 lack virulence and drug-resistance genes. The effects of 
PSE-D1 and PST-H1 on controlling S. Enteritidis CVCC1806 and S. Typhimurium 
CVCC3384 contamination in three kinds of foods (eggshells, sausages and milk) 
were further investigated, respectively. Our results showed that, compared to 
phage-free groups, PSE-D1 and PST-H1 inhibited the growth of their host strain 
significantly. A significant reduction of host bacteria titers (1.5 and 1.9 
log10 CFU/sample, p &lt; 0.001) on eggshells was observed under PSE-D1 and 
PST-H1 treatments, respectively. Furthermore, administration of PSE-D1 and 
PST-H1 decreased the counts of bacteria by 1.1 and 1.2 log10 CFU/cm2 (p &lt; 
0.001) in sausages as well as 1.5 and 1.8 log10 CFU/mL (p &lt; 0.001) in milk, 
respectively. Interesting, the bacteriostasis efficacy of both phages exhibited 
more significantly at 4 °C than that at 28 °C in eggshells and milk and 
sausages. In sum, the purpose of our research was evaluating the counteracting 
effect of phage PSE-D1 and PST-H1 on the spread of Salmonella on contaminated 
foods products. Our results suggested that these two phage-based biocontrol 
treatments are promising strategies for controlling pathogenic Salmonella 
contaminated food."
908,"Punica granatum is a rich source of bioactive compounds which exhibit various 
biological effects. In this study, pomegranate peel and leaf ethanolic crude 
extracts (PPE and PLE, respectively) were phytochemically characterized and 
screened for antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiviral activity. LC-PDA-ESI-MS 
analysis led to the identification of different compounds, including 
ellagitannins, flavonoids and phenolic acids. The low IC50 values, obtained by 
DPPH and FRAP assays, showed a noticeable antioxidant effect of PPE and PLE 
comparable to the reference standards. Both crude extracts and their main 
compounds (gallic acid, ellagic acid and punicalagin) were not toxic on Vero 
cells and exhibited a remarkable inhibitory effect on herpes simplex type 1 
(HSV-1) viral plaques formation. Specifically, PPE inhibited HSV-1 adsorption to 
the cell surface more than PLE. Indeed, the viral DNA accumulation, the 
transcription of viral genes and the expression of viral proteins were 
significantly affected by PPE treatment. Amongst the compounds, punicalagin, 
which is abundant in PPE crude extract, inhibited HSV-1 replication, reducing 
viral DNA and transcripts accumulation, as well as proteins of all three phases 
of the viral replication cascade. In contrast, no antibacterial activity was 
detected. In conclusion, our findings indicate that Punica granatum peel and 
leaf extracts, especially punicalagin, could be a promising therapeutic 
candidate against HSV-1."
909,"It has been previously shown that amino acid polymorphisms in reovirus proteins 
μ2 and λ1 are associated with differing levels of interferon induction. In the 
present study, viruses carrying these polymorphisms in either or both proteins, 
were further studied. The two viral determinants exert a synergistic effect on 
the control of β-interferon induction at the protein and mRNA level, with a 
concomitant increase in RIG-I. In contrast, levels of phospho-Stat1 and 
interferon-stimulated genes are increased in singly substituted viruses but with 
no further increase when both substitutions were present. This suggests that the 
viral determinants are acting during initial events of viral recognition. 
Accordingly, difference between viruses was reduced when infection was performed 
with partially uncoated virions (ISVPs) and transfection of RNA recovered from 
early-infected cells recapitulates the differences between viruses harboring the 
different polymorphisms. Altogether, the data are consistent with a redundant or 
complementary role of μ2 and λ1, affecting either early disassembly or the 
nature of the viral RNA in the incoming viral particle. Proteins involved in 
viral RNA synthesis are thus involved in this likely critical aspect of the 
ability of different reovirus variants to infect various cell types, and to 
discriminate between parental and transformed/cancer cells."
910,"The human microbiome and its importance in health and disease have been the 
subject of numerous research articles. Most microbes reside in the digestive 
tract, with up to 1012 cells per gram of faecal material found in the colon. In 
terms of gene number, it has been estimated that the gut microbiome harbours 
&gt;100 times more genes than the human genome. Several human intestinal 
diseases are strongly associated with disruptions in gut microbiome composition. 
Less studied components of the gut microbiome are the bacterial viruses called 
bacteriophages that may be present in numbers equal to or greater than the 
prokaryotes. Their potential to lyse their bacterial hosts, or to act as agents 
of horizontal gene transfer makes them important research targets. In this study 
in vitro faecal fermentation systems were developed and compared for their 
ability to act as surrogates for the human colon. Changes in bacterial and viral 
composition occurred after introducing a high-titre single phage preparation 
both with and without a known bacterial host during the 24 h-long fermentation. 
We also show that during this timeframe 50 mL plastic tubes can provide data 
similar to that generated in a sophisticated faecal fermenter system. This 
knowledge can guide us to a better understanding of the short-term impact of 
bacteriophage transplants on the bacteriomes and viromes of human recipients."
911,"Newcastle disease (ND) is endemic in poultry in Bangladesh. We performed 
genotypic and pathotypic characterization of four ND virus (NDV) isolates from 
recent outbreaks in broiler chickens in Bangladesh during the period of 
2020-2021. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete fusion protein gene 
coding sequences classified the viruses into NDV class II genotype VII.2 
together with viruses from Indonesia isolated between 2014 and 2021 and a single 
2020 Indian isolate. Pathogenicity testing using the intracerebral pathogenicity 
index in day-old chickens and mean embryo death time in embryonating chicken 
eggs revealed that the Bangladeshi isolates are velogenic. Inoculation of 
35-day-old chickens with two NDV isolates (LT67 and N5) resulted in 100% 
morbidity by 3 days post inoculation (DPI), and all birds succumbed to infection 
by 7 DPI. Massive hemorrhages, congestion and necrotic lesions were observed in 
different visceral organs, which were typical for infection with a velogenic 
viscerotropic pathotype of NDV. At microscopic examination, tracheitis, severe 
pneumonia, focal proventriculitis, transmural enteritis, focal myocarditis, 
severe congestion and necrosis in kidneys, and lymphoid depletion in lymphoid 
tissues were found. Our study reports the first outbreak of the panzootic 
genotype VII.2 NDV in poultry in Bangladesh and documents a possible recent 
re-introduction of this NDV genotype from Southeast or East Asia. This study 
further provides viral distribution and epidemiological data that can facilitate 
the effective control of NDV."
912,"The ponds of the Moscow region during the autumn migration of birds are a place 
with large concentrations of mallard ducks, which are the main hosts of 
avulaviruses (avian paramyxoviruses) and influenza A viruses (IAV). The purpose 
of this study was the determination of the biological diversity of IAV and 
avulaviruses isolated from mallards in Moscow's ponds. A phylogenetic analysis 
of IAV was performed based on complete genome sequencing, and virus genomic 
reassortment in nature was studied. Almost all IAV genome segments clustered 
with apathogenic duck viruses according to phylogenetic analysis. The origin of 
the genes of Moscow isolates were different; some of them belong to European 
evolutionary branches, some to Asian ones. The majority of closely related 
viruses have been isolated in the Western Eurasian region. Much less frequently, 
closely related viruses have been isolated in Siberia, China, and Korea. The 
quantity and diversity of isolated viruses varied considerably depending on the 
year and have decreased since 2014, perhaps due to the increasing proportion of 
nesting and wintering ducks in Moscow."
913,"In South Korea, a total of 21 African swine fever (ASF) infected farms were 
confirmed during 2019-2021. ASF viruses (ASFVs) were isolated from the blood and 
spleen samples of the 21 affected farms and their genetic characteristics were 
analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 21 Korean ASFV strains 
belonged to p72 genotype II and serogroup 8. All isolates were of the intergenic 
region (IGR) II variant with 10 tandem repeat sequences between I73R and I329L 
and the central variable region (CVR) 1 variant of the B602L gene. There were no 
IGR variations between the A179L and A137R and between the MGF 505 9R and10R nor 
mutations in the O174L, K145R, MGF 505-5R, CP204L, and Bt/Sj regions. The genes 
of the 21 ASFV strains were identical to those of Georgia 2007/1 and Chinese and 
Vietnamese strains (Pig/HLJ/2018, China/2018/AnhuiXCGQ, and ASFV_NgheAn_2019); 
however, X69R of the J268L region of the 18th isolate (Korea/Pig/Goseong/2021) 
had three nucleotide (CTA) insertions at the 209th position, which led to the 
addition of one tyrosine (Y) at the C-terminal. This suggests that there are 
variations among ASFVs circulating in South Korea and the 18th ASFV-infected 
farm was due to a variant different from those of the other 20 pig farms."
914,"The recent centennial anniversary of R.E. Montgomery's seminal published 
description of ""a form of swine fever"" disease transmitted from wild African 
pigs to European domestic pigs is a call to action to accelerate African Swine 
Fever (ASF) vaccine research and development. ASF modified live virus (MLV) 
first-generation gene deleted vaccine candidates currently offer the most 
promise to meet international and national guidelines and regulatory 
requirements for veterinary product licensure and market authorization. A major, 
rate-limiting impediment to the acceleration of current as well as future 
vaccine candidates into regulatory development is the absence of internationally 
harmonized standards for assessing vaccine purity, potency, safety, and 
efficacy. This review summarizes the asymmetrical landscape of peer-reviewed 
published literature on ASF MLV vaccine approaches and lead candidates, 
primarily studied to date in the research laboratory in proof-of-concept or 
early feasibility clinical safety and efficacy studies. Initial recommendations 
are offered toward eventual consensus of international harmonized guidelines and 
standards for ASF MLV vaccine purity, potency, safety, and efficacy. To help 
ensure the successful regulatory development and approval of ASF MLV first 
generation vaccines by national regulatory associated government agencies, the 
World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) establishment and publication of 
harmonized international guidelines is paramount."
915,"The 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of positive-strand RNA plant viruses commonly 
contain elements that promote viral replication and translation. The ~700 nt 
3'UTR of umbravirus pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) contains three 3' 
cap-independent translation enhancers (3'CITEs), including one (PTE) found in 
members of several genera in the family Tombusviridae and another (the 3'TSS) 
found in numerous umbraviruses and several carmoviruses. In addition, three 3' 
terminal replication elements are found in nearly every umbravirus and 
carmovirus. For this report, we have identified a set of three hairpins and a 
putative pseudoknot, collectively termed ""Trio"", that are exclusively found in a 
subset of umbraviruses and are located just upstream of the 3'TSS. Modification 
of these elements had no impact on viral translation in wheat germ extracts or 
in translation of luciferase reporter constructs in vivo. In contrast, Trio 
hairpins were critical for viral RNA accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana 
protoplasts and for replication of a non-autonomously replicating replicon using 
a trans-replication system in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Trio and other 3' 
terminal elements involved in viral replication are highly conserved in 
umbraviruses possessing different classes of upstream 3'CITEs, suggesting 
conservation of replication mechanisms among umbraviruses despite variation in 
mechanisms for translation enhancement."
916,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an important viral 
disease, causing significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. 
Atypical cases caused by highly pathogenic PRRS virus (HP-PRRSV) emerged in 2006 
in China. The vaccine strain HuN4-F112 has been developed from the wild-type 
HP-PRRSV HuN4 through repeated passages on MARC-145 cells. However, the 
mechanisms of attenuation have yet to be defined. Previous studies have shown 
that the vaccine strain HuN4-F112 could not effectively replicate in porcine 
alveolar macrophages (PAMs). In the present study, a series of chimeric and 
mutant PRRSVs were constructed to investigate regions associated with the virus 
attenuation. Firstly, the corresponding genome regions (ORF1a, ORF1b and ORFs 
2-7) were exchanged between two infectious clones of HuN4 and HuN4-F112, and 
then the influence of small regions in ORF1a and ORF2-7 was evaluated, then 
influence of specific amino acids on NSP2 was tested. NSP2 was determined to be 
the key gene that regulated infection efficiency on PAMs, and amino acids at 893 
and 979 of NSP2 were the key amino acids. The results of in vivo study indicated 
that NSP2 was not only important for infection efficiency in vitro, but also 
influenced the virulence, which was indicated by the results of survival rate, 
temperature, viremia, lung score and tissue score."
917,"Thousands of unique noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) exist within the genomes of higher 
eukaryotes. Upon virus infection, the host generates interferons (IFNs), which 
initiate the expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) 
through IFN receptors on the cell surface, establishing a barrier as the host's 
antiviral innate immunity. With the development of novel RNA-sequencing 
technology, many IFN-induced ncRNAs have been identified, and increasing 
attention has been given to their functions as regulators involved in the 
antiviral innate immune response. IFN-induced ncRNAs regulate the expression of 
viral proteins, IFNs, and ISGs, as well as host genes that are critical for 
viral replication, cytokine and chemokine production, and signaling pathway 
activation. This review summarizes the complex regulatory role of IFN-induced 
ncRNAs in antiviral innate immunity from the above aspects, aiming to improve 
understanding of ncRNAs and provide reference for the basic research of 
antiviral innate immunity."
918,"Phytophthora cactorum is an important oomycetous plant pathogen with numerous 
host plant species, including garden strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) and silver 
birch (Betula pendula). P. cactorum also hosts mycoviruses, but their phenotypic 
effects on the host oomycete have not been studied earlier. In the present 
study, we tested polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced water stress for virus curing 
and created an isogenic virus-free isolate for testing viral effects in pair 
with the original isolate. Phytophthora cactorum bunya-like viruses 1 and 2 
(PcBV1 & 2) significantly reduced hyphal growth of the P. cactorum host isolate, 
as well as sporangia production and size. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses 
revealed an increase in the production of elicitins due to bunyavirus infection. 
However, the presence of bunyaviruses did not seem to alter the pathogenicity of 
P. cactorum. Virus transmission through anastomosis was unsuccessful in vitro."
919,"A co-expressed Penaeus stylirostris densovirus (PstDNV) capsid and dsRNA 
specific to the yellow head virus (YHV) protease (CoEx cpPstDNV/dspro) has been 
shown to suppress YHV replication in the Pacific white-legged shrimp 
(Litopenaeus vannamei). However, maintaining two plasmids in a single bacterial 
cell is not desirable; therefore, a single plasmid harboring both the PstDNV 
capsid and the dsRNA-YHV-pro gene was constructed under the regulation of a 
single T7 promoter, designated pET28a-Linked cpPstDNV-dspro. Following 
induction, this novel construct expressed an approximately 37-kDa recombinant 
protein associated with a roughly 400-bp dsRNA (Linked cpPstDNV-dspro). Under a 
transmission electron microscope, the virus-like particles (VLP; Linked PstDNV 
VLPs-dspro) obtained were seen to be monodispersed, similar to the native PstDNV 
virion. A nuclease digestion assay indicated dsRNA molecules were both 
encapsulated and present outside the Linked PstDNV VLPs-dspro. In addition, the 
amount of dsRNA produced from this strategy was higher than that obtained with a 
co-expression strategy. In a YHV infection challenge, the Linked PstDNV 
VLPs-dspro was more effective in delaying and reducing mortality than other 
constructs tested. Lastly, the linked construct provides protection for the 
dsRNA cargo from nucleolytic enzymes present in the shrimp hemolymph. This is 
the first report of a VLP carrying virus-inhibiting dsRNA that could be produced 
without disassembly and reassembly to control virus infection in shrimp."
920,"With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, routine surveillance combined with sequence 
and phylogenetic analysis of coronaviruses is urgently required. In the current 
study, the four common human coronaviruses (HCoVs), OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E, 
were screened in 361 clinical samples collected from hospitalized children with 
respiratory symptoms during four winter seasons. RT-PCR-based detection and 
typing revealed different prevalence rates of HCoVs across the four seasons. 
Interestingly, none of the four HCoVs were detected in the samples (n = 100) 
collected during the winter season of the COVID-19 pandemic. HCoV-OC43 (4.15%) 
was the most frequently detected, followed by 229E (1.1%). Partial sequences of 
S and N genes of OC43 from the winter seasons of 2015/2016 and 2021/2022 were 
used for sequence and phylogenetic analysis. Multiple sequence alignment of the 
two Saudi OC43s strains with international strains revealed the presence of 
sequence deletions and several mutations, of which some changed their 
corresponding amino acids. Glycosylation profiles revealed a number of O-and 
N-glycosylation sites in both genes. Based on phylogenetic analysis, four 
genotypes were observed with Riyadh strains grouped into the genotype C. Further 
long-term surveillance with a large number of clinical samples and sequences is 
necessary to resolve the circulation patterns and evolutionary kinetics of OC43 
in Saudi Arabia."
921,"BACKGROUND: Outbreaks of small ruminant morbillivirus (SRMV) are regularly 
occurring in Pakistan despite vaccine availability. This study was designed to 
identify substitutions within the immunogenic structural and functional regions 
of the nucleocapsid, fusion, and hemagglutinin genes of SRMV and their 
comparison with vaccinal strains of Nigerian and Indian origin.
METHODS: Swabs and tissue samples were collected from diseased animals. RT-PCR 
was used to characterize selected genes encoded by viral RNA. The study's N, F, 
and H protein sequences and vaccinal strains were analyzed for B and T cell 
epitope prediction using ABCpred, Bipred, and IEDB, respectively.
RESULTS: Significant substitutions were found on the C terminus of the 
nucleocapsid, within the fusion motif region of the fusion gene and in the 
immunoreactive region of the hemagglutinin gene.
CONCLUSION: Our results emphasize the need for the development of effective 
vaccines that match the existing variants of SRMV strains circulating in 
Pakistan."
922,"Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a complex and often fatal disease of 
ungulates. Effective vaccines are needed to avoid MCF outbreaks and mitigate 
losses. This study aimed to evaluate a sheep-associated MCF (SA-MCF) vaccine 
candidate targeting ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2) glycoprotein B (gB). Rabbits 
were used as a laboratory animal model to test the safety, immunogenicity, and 
protective efficacy of a chimeric virus consisting of a recombinant, 
non-pathogenic strain of alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 encoding OvHV-2 ORF8 to 
express gB (AlHV-1∆ORF73/OvHV-2-ORF8). Viral-vectored immunizations were 
performed by using the AlHV-1∆ORF73/OvHV-2-ORF8 chimera alone or as a DNA prime 
(OvHV-2-ORF8)-virus boost regimen. The viral vector was inoculated by 
intravenous or intramuscular routes and the DNA was delivered by intradermal 
shots using a gene gun. The vaccine candidates were deemed safe as no clinical 
signs were observed following any of the immunizations. Anti-OvHV-2 gB 
antibodies with neutralizing activity were induced by all immunogens. At three 
weeks post-final immunization, all animals were challenged intranasally with a 
lethal dose of OvHV-2. MCF protection rates ranging from 66.7% to 71.4% were 
observed in vaccinated rabbits, while all mock-vaccinated animals developed the 
disease. The significant protective efficacy obtained with the vaccine platforms 
tested in this study encourages further trials in relevant livestock species, 
such as cattle and bison."
923,"The current influenza vaccines only confer protection against the circulating 
influenza subtypes, therefore universal vaccines are needed to prevent upcoming 
influenza outbreaks caused by emerging influenza subtypes. The extracellular 
domain of influenza A M2 protein (M2e) is highly conserved among different 
subtypes of influenza A viruses, and it is able to elicit protective immunity 
against the viruses. The influenza nucleoprotein (NP) was used to display the 
M2e in this study due to its promising T-cell response and adjuvanticity. The 
M2e gene was fused to the 5'-end of the NP gene and then cloned into pRSET B 
vector. The DNA sequencing analysis revealed six point mutations in the M2e-NP 
fusion gene, including one mutation in the M2e peptide and five mutations in the 
NP. The mutations were reverted using PCR site-directed mutagenesis. The 
recombinant plasmids (pRSET B-M2e-NP and pRSET B-mM2e-NP) were introduced into 
Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. The mutated and 
non-mutated proteins were subsequently expressed and named mM2e-NP and M2e-NP, 
respectively. The expression of mM2e-NP and M2e-NP was not affected by the 
mutations. The binding of anti-M2e antibody to the purified native mM2e-NP and 
M2e-NP also remained active. However, when the anti-NP antibody was tested, the 
signal produced by mM2e-NP was very weak. The results implied that the amino 
acid changes in the NP had adversely impacted on the conformation of mM2e-NP and 
subsequently affected the antibody binding. In light of the remarkable antibody 
binding to the M2e-NP fusion protein, this study highly recommends the potential 
of M2e-NP as a universal influenza vaccine candidate."
924,"Skeletal muscle is a promising tissue for therapeutic gene delivery because it 
is highly vascularized, accessible, and capable of synthesizing protein for 
therapies or vaccines. The application of electric pulses (electroporation) 
enhances plasmid DNA delivery and expression by increasing membrane 
permeability. Four hours after plasmid electroporation, we evaluated acute gene 
and protein expression changes in mouse skeletal muscle to identify regulated 
genes and genetic pathways. RNA sequencing followed by functional annotation was 
used to evaluate differentially expressed mRNAs. Our data highlighted immune 
signaling pathways that may influence the effectiveness of DNA electroporation. 
Cytokine and chemokine protein levels in muscle lysates revealed the 
upregulation of a subset of inflammatory proteins and confirmed the RNA 
sequencing analysis. Several regulated DNA-specific pattern recognition receptor 
mRNAs were also detected. Identifying unique molecular changes in the muscle 
will facilitate a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms 
and the development of safety biomarkers and novel strategies to improve 
skeletal muscle targeted gene therapy."
925,"African swine fever (ASF) is an obligated declaration swine disease, provoking 
farm isolation measures and the closing of affected country boarders. ASF virus 
(ASFV) is currently the cause of a pandemic across China and Eurasia. By the end 
of 2019, ASF was detected in nine EU Member States: Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, 
Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Belgium. The affected area of 
the EU extended progressively, moving mostly in a southwestern direction (EFSA). 
Inactivated and/or subunit vaccines have proven to fail since certain virus 
replication is needed for protection. LAVs are thus the most realistic option, 
which must be safe, effective and industrially scalable. We here generated a 
vaccine prototype from the Arm/07/CBM/c2 genotype II strain, in which we have 
deleted the EP402R (CD2v) and A238L genes by CRISPR/Cas9 in COS-1 cells, without 
detectable further genetic changes. The successful immunization of pigs has 
proven this vaccine to be safe and fully protective against the circulating 
Korean Paju genotype II strain, opening the possibility of a new vaccine on the 
market in the near future."
926,"Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is a thyroid disease associated with viral 
infections. Its relationship with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
antigens was shown before. SAT cases triggered by different types of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines have been 
reported. In this study, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes of 27 SAT 
patients (13 vaccine-associated (V-SAT) and 14 non-SARS-CoV-2-infection 
non-vaccine-associated (non-V-SAT)) were compared with those of 362 healthy 
donors. HLA analyses were performed with low-resolution DNA-based 
sequence-specific oligonucleotide or sequence-specific primer methods. 
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and Stata/MP 
14.1 with the hapipf function. Allele and haplotype frequencies were estimated 
by PyPop and gene[RATE] tool programs. The allele frequencies of HLA-A*11, 
HLA-B*35, and HLA-C*04 were higher in the patient groups. Both the allele 
frequency of HLA-A*11 and the haplotype frequency of A*11-B*35-C*04 were higher 
in the V-SAT group. The A*11-B*35-C*04 haplotype, including all three loci of 
MHC class I genes, is shown to be associated with the disease for the first 
time, especially in the V-SAT group. This finding will contribute to a better 
understanding of the etiopathogenesis of vaccine-associated SAT and the role of 
HLA genotypes in the functioning mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines."
927,"Conventional medical agents for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with some 
adverse effects no longer meet the needs of the public. In this study, the 
prognosis-related hub genes of osmanthus-targeted therapy for OSCC were 
predicted and analyzed by network pharmacology and molecular docking. Osmanthus 
was extracted using the ethanol reflux method and osmanthus-loaded PVP/PVA 
(OF/PVP/PVA) hydrogel was prepared by electron beam radiation. The molecular 
structure, crystal structure and microscopic morphology of hydrogels were 
observed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. OSCC cells CAL-27 
were cultured with OF/PVP/PVA hydrogel at different concentrations of extract to 
discover cell proliferation by MTT assay. The scratching test and JC-1 staining 
were used to observe the migration and mitochondrial membrane potential. Through 
experimental exploration, we found that a total of six prognosis-related targets 
were predicted, which are PYGL, AURKA, SQLE, etc., and osmanthus extract had 
good binding activity to AURKA. In vitro, except for proliferation inhibition, 
OF/PVP/PVA hydrogel prevented cell migration and changed the mitochondrial 
membrane potential of CAL-27 cells at a concentration equal to or greater than 
50 μg/mL (p &lt; 0.05). The addition of autophagy inhibitor chloroquine and 
3-methyladenine weakened the migration inhibition of hydrogel (p &lt; 0.05)."
928,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease 
with limited treatment options. The widely distributed plant Aloe vera has shown 
protective effects against NASH in animals, yet the precise mechanism remains 
unknown. In this study, we investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the 
anti-NASH effects of Aloe vera using a network pharmacology and molecular 
docking approach. By searching online databases and analyzing the Gene 
Expression Omnibus dataset, we obtained 260 Aloe vera-NASH common targets. Gene 
Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses showed 
that the common targets were strongly associated with the key pathological 
processes implicated in NASH, including lipid and glucose metabolism, 
inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and liver fibrosis. Four core 
proteins, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNFα), transcription factor c-Jun, and tumor suppressor protein p53, were 
identified from compound-target-pathway and protein-protein interaction 
networks. Molecular docking analysis verified that the active ingredients of 
Aloe vera were able to interact with the core proteins, especially AKT1 and 
TNFα. The results demonstrate the multi-compound, multi-target, and 
multi-pathway mechanisms of Aloe vera against NASH. Our study has shown the 
scientific basis for further experiments in terms of the mechanism to develop 
Aloe vera-based natural products as complementary treatments for NASH. 
Furthermore, it identifies novel drug candidates based on the structures of Aloe 
vera's active compounds."
929,"Transposable elements (TEs) contribute not only to genome diversity but also to 
transcriptome diversity in plants. To unravel the sources of LTR retrotransposon 
(RTE) transcripts in sunflower, we exploited a recently developed transposon 
activation method ('TEgenesis') along with long-read cDNA Nanopore sequencing. 
This approach allows for the identification of 56 RTE transcripts from different 
genomic loci including full-length and non-autonomous RTEs. Using the mobilome 
analysis, we provided a new set of expressed and transpositional active 
sunflower RTEs for future studies. Among them, a Ty3/Gypsy RTE called SUNTY3 
exhibited ongoing transposition activity, as detected by eccDNA analysis. We 
showed that the sunflower genome contains a diverse set of non-autonomous RTEs 
encoding a single RTE protein, including the previously described TR-GAG 
(terminal repeat with the GAG domain) as well as new categories, TR-RT-RH, 
TR-RH, and TR-INT-RT. Our results demonstrate that 40% of the loci for 
RTE-related transcripts (nonLTR-RTEs) lack their LTR sequences and resemble 
conventional eucaryotic genes encoding RTE-related proteins with unknown 
functions. It was evident based on phylogenetic analysis that three nonLTR-RTEs 
encode GAG (HadGAG1-3) fused to a host protein. These HadGAG proteins have 
homologs found in other plant species, potentially indicating GAG domestication. 
Ultimately, we found that the sunflower retrotranscriptome originated from the 
transcription of active RTEs, non-autonomous RTEs, and gene-like RTE 
transcripts, including those encoding domesticated proteins."
930,"In an olive orchard on the western part of Istria, Croatia, twig and branch 
dieback was observed on several olive trees. In total, seven samples from 
symptomatic trees were collected. Samples were analyzed, and four fungal 
isolates showed morphological similarities to the species Phaeoacremonium. One 
isolate, chosen as a representative, was taken for molecular identification and 
pathogenicity tests. Based on the DNA sequence data of the ITS, TUB, and EF1α 
gene regions, the isolate was identified as P. iranianum. Pathogenicity tests 
were conducted on detached olive branches and olive trees in the greenhouse. To 
the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of twig and branch dieback 
on olive caused by Phaeoacremonium iranianum."
931,"Grapevine cultivation, such as the whole horticulture, is currently challenged 
by several factors, among which the extreme weather events occurring under the 
climate change scenario are the most relevant. Within this context, the present 
study aims at characterizing at the berry level the physiological response of 
Vitis vinifera cv. Sauvignon Blanc to sequential stresses simulated under a 
semi-controlled environment: flooding at bud-break followed by multiple summer 
stress (drought plus heatwave) occurring at pre-vèraison. Transcriptomic and 
metabolomic assessments were performed through RNASeq and NMR, respectively. A 
comprehensive hormone profiling was also carried out. Results pointed out a 
different response to the heatwave in the two situations. Flooding caused a 
developmental advance, determining a different physiological background in the 
berry, thus affecting its response to the summer stress at both transcriptional 
levels, with the upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress responses, 
and metabolic level, with the increase in osmoprotectants, such as proline and 
other amino acids. In conclusion, sequential stress, including a flooding event 
at bud-break followed by a summer heatwave, may impact phenological development 
and berry ripening, with possible consequences on berry and wine quality. A 
berry physiological model is presented that may support the development of 
sustainable vineyard management solutions to improve the water use efficiency 
and adaptation capacity of actual viticultural systems to future scenarios."
932,"General Control Non-Derepressible 5 (GCN5) is a histone acetyltransferase that 
targets multiple genes and is essential for the acetylation of Lysine residues 
in the N-terminal tail of histone H3 in Arabidopsis. GCN5 interacts with the 
transcriptional coactivator Alteration/Deficiency in Activation 2b (ADA2b), 
which enhances its activity functioning in multiprotein complexes, such as the 
Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase complex (SAGA). Mutations in GCN5 and ADA2b 
result in pleiotropic phenotypes, including alterations in the growth of roots. 
Auxin is known to regulate root development by modulating gene expression 
patterns. Auxin moves polarly during plant growth via the Pin-formed (PIN) auxin 
efflux transport proteins. The effect of GCN5 and ADA2b on auxin distribution at 
different stages of early root growth (4 to 7 days post-germination) was studied 
using the reporter lines DR5rev::GFP and PIN1::PIN1-GFP. In wild-type plants, 
auxin efflux transporter PIN1 expression increases from the fourth to the 
seventh day of root growth. The PIN1 expression was reduced in the roots of 
gcn5-1 and ada2b-1 compared to the wild type. The expression of PIN1 in ada2b-1 
mutants is confined only to the meristematic zone, specifically in the stele 
cells, whereas it is almost abolished in the elongation zone. Gene expression 
analysis showed that genes associated with auxin transport, PIN1, PIN3 and PIN4, 
are downregulated in gcn5-1 and ada2b-1 mutants relative to the wild type. As a 
result, auxin accumulation was also reduced in gcn5-1 and ada2b-1 compared to 
wild-type roots. Furthermore, acetylation of Lysine 14 of histone H3 (H3K14) was 
also affected in the promoter and coding region of PIN1, PIN3 and PIN4 genes 
during root growth of Arabidopsis in gcn5 mutants. In conclusion, GCN5 acts as a 
positive regulator of auxin distribution in early root growth by modulating 
histone H3 acetylation and the expression of auxin efflux transport genes."
933,"SlSPL-CNR is a multifunctional transcription factor gene that plays important 
roles in regulating tomato fruit ripening. However, the molecular basis of 
SlSPL-CNR in the regulatory networks is not exactly clear. In the present study, 
the biochemical characteristics and expression levels of genes involved in 
ethylene biosynthesis in Colorless nonripening (Cnr) natural mutant were 
determined. The proteomic changes during the ripening stage were also uncovered 
by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based 
quantitative proteomic analysis. Results indicated that both the lycopene 
content and soluble solid content (SSC) in Cnr fruit were lower than those in 
wild-type AC fruit. Meanwhile, pH, flavonoid content, and chlorophyll content 
were higher in Cnr fruit. Expressions of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis 
were also downregulated or delayed in Cnr fruit. Furthermore, 1024 and 1234 
differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were respectively identified for the 
breaker and 10 days postbreaker stages. Among them, a total of 512 proteins were 
differentially expressed at both stages. In addition, the functions of DEPs were 
classified by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) enrichment analysis. Results would lay the groundwork for wider 
explorations of the regulatory mechanism of SlSPL-CNR on tomato fruit ripening."
934,"Pawpaw (Asimina triloba) trees exhibiting stunting and foliar mosaic, chlorosis, 
or distortions were observed in New York. In 2021, leaf samples from two 
symptomatic trees and a sapling, as well as two asymptomatic trees, were tested 
for the presence of viruses and viroids by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) 
using total RNA after ribosomal RNA depletion. HTS sequence information revealed 
tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) and tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV) in symptomatic 
but not in asymptomatic leaves. HTS reads and de novo-assembled contigs covering 
the genomes of both viruses were obtained, with a higher average read depth for 
RNA2 than RNA1. The occurrence of TRSV and ToRSV was confirmed in the original 
leaf samples used for HTS and 12 additional trees and saplings from New York and 
Maryland in 2022 by RT-PCR combined with Sanger sequencing, and DAS-ELISA. 
Single infections by TRSV in 11 of 14 trees and dual infections by TRSV and 
ToRSV in 3 of 14 trees were identified. The nucleotide sequence identity of 
partial gene fragments of TRSV and ToRSV was high among pawpaw isolates 
(94.9-100% and 91.8-100%, respectively) and between pawpaw isolates and isolates 
from other horticultural crops (93.6-100% and 71.3-99.3%, respectively). This 
study is the first to determine the virome of pawpaw."
935,"Many species in the genus Guettarda are known to exert anti-inflammatory effects 
and are used as traditional medicinal plants to treat various inflammatory 
symptoms. However, no studies on the inflammatory activities of Guettarda 
crispiflora Vahl have been reported. The aim of the study was to investigate in 
vitro and in vivo the anti-inflammatory effects of a methanol extract of 
Guettarda crispiflora Vahl (Gc-ME). To determine the anti-inflammatory activity 
of Gc-ME, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-, poly(I:C)-, or Pam3CSK4-treated RAW264.7 
cells, HCl/EtOH- and LPS-treated mice were employed for in vitro and in vivo 
tests. LPS-induced nitric oxide production in RAW264.7 cells was determined by 
Griess assays and cytokine gene expression in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells, 
confirmed by RT- and real-time PCR. Transcriptional activation was evaluated by 
luciferase reporter gene assay. Target protein validation was assessed by 
Western blot analysis and cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA) with LPS-treated 
RAW264.7 and gene-transfected HEK293 cells. Using both a HCl/EtOH-induced 
gastritis model and an LPS-induced lung injury model, inflammatory states were 
checked by scoring or evaluating gastric lesions, lung edema, and lung 
histology. Phytochemical fingerprinting of Gc-ME was observed by using liquid 
chromatography-mass spectrometry. Nitric oxide production induced by LPS and 
Pam3CSK4 in RAW264.7 cells was revealed to be reduced by Gc-ME. The LPS-induced 
upregulation of iNOS, COX-2, IL-6, and IL-1β was also suppressed by Gc-ME 
treatment. Gc-ME downregulated the promotor activities of AP-1 and NF-κB 
triggered by MyD88- and TRIF induction. Upstream signaling proteins for NF-κB 
activation, namely, p-p50, p-p65, p-IκBα, and p-Src were all downregulated by 
Ch-EE. Moreover, Src was revealed to be directly targeted by Gc-ME. This 
extract, orally treated strongly, attenuated the inflammatory symptoms in 
HCl/EtOH-treated stomachs and LPS-treated lungs. Therefore, these results 
strongly imply that Guettarda crispiflora can be developed as a promising 
anti-inflammatory remedy with Src-suppressive properties."
936,"Female Cannabis sativa plants have important therapeutic properties. The sex 
ratio of the dioecious cannabis is approximately 1:1. Cultivating homozygous 
female plants by inducing female plants to produce male flowers is of great 
practical significance. However, the mechanism underlying cannabis male 
development remains unclear. In this study, single-molecule real-time (SMRT) 
sequencing was performed using a mixed sample of female and induced male flowers 
from the ZYZM1 cannabis variety. A total of 15,241 consensus reads were 
identified, and 13,657 transcripts were annotated across seven public databases. 
A total of 48 lncRNAs with an average length of 986.54 bp were identified. In 
total, 8202 transcripts were annotated as transcription factors, the most common 
of which were bHLH transcription factors. Moreover, tissue-specific expression 
pattern analysis showed that 13 MADS transcription factors were highly expressed 
in male flowers. Furthermore, 232 reads of novel genes were predicted and 
enriched in lipid metabolism, and qRT-PCR results showed that CER1 may be 
involved in the development of cannabis male flowers. In addition, 1170 AS 
events were detected, and two AS events were further validated. Taken together, 
these results may improve our understanding of the complexity of full-length 
cannabis transcripts and provide a basis for understanding the molecular 
mechanism of cannabis male development."
937,"Chinese cabbage tipburn is characterized by the formation of necrotic lesions on 
the margin of leaves, including on the insides of the leafy head. This 
physiological disorder is associated with a localized calcium deficiency during 
leaf development. However, little information is available regarding the 
molecular mechanisms governing Ca-deficiency-triggered tipburn. This study 
comprehensively analysed the transcriptomic comparison between control and 
calcium treatments (CK and 0 mM Ca) in Chinese cabbage to determine its 
molecular mechanism in tipburn. Our analysis identified that the most enriched 
gene ontology (GO) categories are photosynthesis, thylakoid and cofactor 
binding. Moreover, the KEGG pathway was most enriched in photosynthesis, carbon 
metabolism and carbon fixation. We also analyzed the co-expression network by 
functional categories and identified ten critical hub differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) in each gene regulatory network (GRN). These DEGs might involve 
abiotic stresses, developmental processes, cell wall metabolism, calcium 
distribution, transcription factors, plant hormone biosynthesis and signal 
transduction pathways. Under calcium deficiency, CNX1, calmodulin-binding 
proteins and CMLs family proteins were downregulated compared to CK. In 
addition, plant hormones such as GA, JA, BR, Auxin and ABA biosynthesis pathways 
genes were downregulated under calcium treatment. Likewise, HATs, ARLs and TCP 
transcription factors were reported as inactive under calcium deficiency, and 
potentially involved in the developmental process. This work explores the 
specific DEGs' significantly different expression levels in 0 mM Ca and the 
control involved in plant hormones, cell wall developments, a light response 
such as chlorophylls and photosynthesis, transport metabolism and defence 
mechanism and redox. Our results provide critical evidence of the potential 
roles of the calcium signal transduction pathway and candidate genes governing 
Ca-deficiency-triggered tipburn in Chinese cabbage."
938,"The Arabidopsis PROSCOOP genes belong to a family predicted to encode secreted 
pro-peptides, which undergo maturation steps to produce peptides named SCOOP. 
Some of them are involved in defence signalling through their perception by a 
receptor complex including MIK2, BAK1 and BKK1. Here, we focused on the 
PROSCOOP10 gene, which is highly and constitutively expressed in aerial organs. 
The MS/MS analyses of leaf apoplastic fluids allowed the identification of two 
distinct peptides (named SCOOP10#1 and SCOOP10#2) covering two different regions 
of PROSCOOP10. They both possess the canonical S-X-S family motif and have 
hydroxylated prolines. This identification in apoplastic fluids confirms the 
biological reality of SCOOP peptides for the first time. NMR and molecular 
dynamics studies showed that the SCOOP10 peptides, although largely unstructured 
in solution, tend to assume a hairpin-like fold, exposing the two serine 
residues previously identified as essential for the peptide activity. 
Furthermore, PROSCOOP10 mutations led to an early-flowering phenotype and 
increased expression of the floral integrators SOC1 and LEAFY, consistent with 
the de-regulated transcription of PROSCOOP10 in several other mutants displaying 
early- or late-flowering phenotypes. These results suggest a role for PROSCOOP10 
in flowering time, highlighting the functional diversity within the PROSCOOP 
family."
939,"A plant cell wall is a highly complex structure consisting of networks of 
polysaccharides, proteins, and polyphenols that dynamically change during growth 
and development in various tissues. The cell wall not only acts as a physical 
barrier but also dynamically responds to disturbances caused by biotic and 
abiotic stresses. Plants have well-established surveillance mechanisms to detect 
any cell wall perturbations. Specific immune signaling pathways are triggered to 
contrast biotic or abiotic forces, including cascades dedicated to reinforcing 
the cell wall structure. This review summarizes the recent developments in 
molecular mechanisms underlying maintenance of cell wall integrity in 
plant-pathogen and parasitic interactions. Subjects such as the effect of 
altered expression of endogenous plant cell-wall-related genes or apoplastic 
expression of microbial cell-wall-modifying enzymes on cell wall integrity are 
covered. Targeted genetic modifications as a tool to study the potential of cell 
wall elicitors, priming of signaling pathways, and the outcome of disease 
resistance phenotypes are also discussed. The prime importance of understanding 
the intricate details and complete picture of plant immunity emerges, ultimately 
to engineer new strategies to improve crop productivity and sustainability."
940,"As representative of the early-divergent groups of angiosperms, Saxifragales is 
extremely divergent in morphology, comprising 15 families. Within this order, 
our previous case studies observed significant structural diversities among the 
plastomes of several lineages, suggesting a possible role in elucidating their 
deep phylogenetic relationships. Here, we collected 208 available plastomes from 
11 constituent families to explore the evolutionary patterns among Saxifragales. 
With thorough comparisons, the losses of two genes and three introns were found 
in several groups. Notably, 432 indel events have been observed from the introns 
of all 17 plastomic intron-containing genes, which could well play an important 
role in family barcoding. Moreover, numerous heterogeneities and strong 
intrafamilial phylogenetic implications were revealed in pttRNA (plastomic tRNA) 
structures, and the unique structural patterns were also determined for five 
families. Most importantly, based on the well-supported phylogenetic trees, 
evident phylogenetic signals were detected in combinations with the identified 
pttRNAs features and intron indels, demonstrating abundant lineage-specific 
characteristics for Saxifragales. Collectively, the results reported here could 
not only provide a deeper understanding into the evolutionary patterns of 
Saxifragales, but also provide a case study for exploring the plastome evolution 
at a high taxonomic level of angiosperms."
941,"In our article, we analyzed new data on the origin of the hybrid genus 
×Trisetokoeleria. According to the morphological criteria ×T. jurtzevii is a 
hybrid between Koeleria asiatica s. l. and Trisetum spicatum, ×T. taimyrica, and 
originated from Koeleria asiatica s. l. and Trisetum subalpestre, ×T. 
gorodkowii, a hybrid between Koeleria asiatica and Trisetum ruprechtianum. Later 
×T. taimyrica was transferred to Koeleria. Parental taxa are prone to active 
hybridization themselves, thus, new methods of next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
were needed to clarify the relationships of these genera. For NGS we used the 
fragment 18S rDNA (part)-ITS1-5.8S rDNA (totally 441 accessions). We analyzed 
ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2 region, trnL-trnF and trnK-rps16 from eight samples of the 
five species, using the Sanger method: ×Trisetokoeleria jurtzevii, ×T. 
taimyrica, Koeleria asiatica, Sibirotrisetum sibiricum (=Trisetum sibiricum), 
and Trisetum spicatum. We also studied the pollen fertility of ×Trisetokoeleria 
and its possible progenitors. Our data partly contradicted previous assumptions, 
based on morphological grounds, and showed us a picture of developed 
introgression within and between Koeleria and Trisetum. ×T. jurtzevii, a totally 
sterile hybrid formed rather recently. We can suppose that ×T. jurtzevii is a 
hybrid between K. asiatica and some Trisetum s. str. Species, but not T. 
spicatum. ×T. gorodkowii, a hybrid in the stage of primary stabilization; it has 
one unique ribotype related to T. spicatum s. l. The second parental species is 
unrelated to Trisetum ruprechtianum. ×T. taimyrica and is a stabilized hybrid 
species; it shares major ribotypes with the T. spicatum/T. wrangelense group and 
has a minor fraction of rDNA related to genus Deyeuxia s. l."
942,"Sorghum [Sorghum&amp;nbsp;bicolor (L.) Moench] is an important crop for food, 
feed, and fuel production. Particularly, sorghum is targeted for cellulosic 
ethanol production. Extraction of cellulose from cell walls is a key process in 
cellulosic ethanol production, and understanding the components involved in 
cellulose synthesis is important for both fundamental and applied research. 
Despite the significance in the biofuel industry, the genes involved in sorghum 
cell wall biosynthesis, modification, and degradation have not been 
characterized. In this study, we have identified and characterized three allelic 
thick leaf mutants (thl1, thl2, and thl3). Bulked Segregant Analysis sequencing 
(BSAseq) showed that the causal mutation for the thl phenotype is in 
endo-1,4-β-glucanase gene (SbKOR1). Consistent with the causal gene function, 
the thl mutants showed decreased crystalline cellulose content in the stem 
tissues. The SbKOR1 function was characterized using Arabidopsis 
endo-1,4-β-glucanase gene mutant (rsw2-1). Complementation of Arabidopsis with 
SbKOR1 (native Arabidopsis promoter and overexpression by 35S promoter) restored 
the radial swelling phenotype of rsw2-1 mutant, proving that SbKOR1 functions as 
endo-1,4-β-glucanase. Overall, the present study has identified and 
characterized sorghum endo-1,4-β-glucanase gene function, laying the foundation 
for future research on cell wall biosynthesis and engineering of sorghum for 
biofuel production."
943,"Physiological response and transcriptome changes were observed to investigate 
the effects on the growth, metabolism and genetic changes of Pinus densiflora 
grown for a long time in an environment with an elevated atmospheric CO2 
concentration. Pine trees were grown at ambient (400 ppm) and elevated (560 ppm 
and 720 ppm) CO2 concentrations for 10 years in open-top chambers. The content 
of nonstructural carbohydrates was significantly increased in elevated CO2. It 
was notable that the contents of chlorophylls significantly decreased at an 
elevated CO2. The activities of antioxidants were significantly increased at an 
elevated CO2 concentration of 720 ppm. We analyzed the differences in the 
transcriptomes of Pinus densiflora at ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations 
and elucidated the functions of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). 
RNA-Seq analysis identified 2415 and 4462 DEGs between an ambient and elevated 
CO2 concentrations of 560 ppm and 720 ppm, respectively. Genes related to 
glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and starch/sucrose metabolism were unchanged or 
decreased at an elevated CO2 concentration of 560 ppm and tended to increase at 
an elevated CO2 concentration of 720 ppm. It was confirmed that the expression 
levels of genes related to photosynthesis and antioxidants were increased at an 
elevated CO2 concentration of 720 ppm."
944,"The intra- and interdomain phyllosphere microbiome features of Quercus ilex L. 
in a Mediterranean context is reported. We hypothesized that the main driver of 
the phyllosphere microbiome might be the season and that atmospheric pollutants 
might have a co-effect. Hence, we investigated the composition of epiphytic 
bacteria and fungi of leaves sampled in urban and natural areas (in Southern 
Italy) in summer and winter, using microscopy and metagenomic analysis. To 
assess possible co-effects on the composition of the phyllosphere microbiome, 
concentrations of particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
were determined from sampled leaves. We found that environmental factors had a 
significative influence on the phyllosphere biodiversity, altering the taxa 
relative abundances. Ascomycota and Firmicutes were higher in summer and in 
urban areas, whereas a significant increase in Proteobacteria was observed in 
the winter season, with higher abundance in natural areas. Network analysis 
suggested that OTUs belonging to Acidobacteria, Cytophagia, unkn. Firmicutes(p), 
Actinobacteria are keystone of the Q. ilex phyllosphere microbiome. In addition, 
83 genes coding for 5 enzymes involved in PAH degradation pathways were 
identified. Given that the phyllosphere microbiome can be considered an 
extension of the ecosystem services offered by trees, our results can be 
exploited in the framework of Next-Generation Biomonitoring."
945,"Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is one of the important crops in Canada and has 
the potential to expand its production further north into the Canadian Prairies. 
Such expansion, however, requires the search for adapted soybean germplasm 
useful for the development of productive cultivars with earlier maturity and 
increased protein concentration. We initiated several research activities to 
characterize 848 accessions of the soybean collection conserved at Plant Gene 
Resources of Canada (PGRC) for maturity, oil and protein concentration, and 
genetic distinctness. The characterization revealed a wide range of variations 
present in each assessed trait among the PGRC soybean accessions. The trait 
variabilities allowed for the identification of four core subsets of 35 PGRC 
soybean accessions, each specifically targeted for early maturity for growing in 
Saskatoon and Ottawa, and for high oil and protein concentration. The two early 
maturity core subsets for Saskatoon and Ottawa displayed days to maturity 
ranging from 103 to 126 days and 94 to 102 days, respectively. The two core 
subsets for high oil and protein concentration showed the highest oil and 
protein concentration from 25.0 to 22.7% and from 52.8 to 46.7%, respectively. 
However, these core subsets did not differ significantly in genetic distinctness 
(as measured with 19,898 SNP markers across 20 soybean chromosomes) from the 
whole PGRC soybean collection. These findings are useful, particularly for the 
management and utilization of the conserved soybean germplasm."
946,"MYB transcription factors (TFs) comprise a large gene family that plays an 
important role in plant growth, development, stress responses, and defense 
regulation. However, their functions in peanut remain to be further elucidated. 
Here, we identified six AhMYB44 genes (AhMYB44-01/11, AhMYB44-05/15, and 
AhMYB44-06/16) in cultivated peanut. They are typical R2R3-MYB TFs and have many 
similarities but different expression patterns in response to drought stress, 
suggesting different functions under drought stress. Homologous genes with 
higher expression in each pair were selected for further study. All of them were 
nuclear proteins and had no self-transactivation activity. In addition, we 
compared the performances of different lines at germination, seedling, and adult 
stages under drought stress. After drought treatment, the overexpression of 
AhMYB44-11 transgenic plants resulted in the longest root length at the seedling 
stage. Levels of proline, soluble sugar and chlorophyll, and expression levels 
of stress-related genes, including P5CS1, RD29A, CBF1, and COR15A, were higher 
than those of the wild type (WT) at the adult stage. While the overexpression of 
AhMYB44-16 significantly increased the drought sensitivity of plants at all 
stages, with differential ABA content, the expression levels of the ABA-related 
genes PP2CA and ABI1 were significantly upregulated and those of ABA1 and ABA2 
were significantly downregulated compared with the WT. AhMYB44-05 showed similar 
downregulated expression as AhMYB44-16 under drought stress, but its 
overexpression in Arabidopsis did not significantly affect the drought 
resistance of transgenic plants. Based on the results, we propose that 
AhMYB44-11 plays a role as a positive factor in drought tolerance by increasing 
the transcription abundance of stress-related genes and the accumulation of 
osmolytes, while AhMYB44-16 negatively regulates drought tolerance through its 
involvement in ABA-dependent stress response pathways."
947,"An ever-growing world population demands to be fed in the future and 
environmental protection and climate change need to be taken into account. An 
important factor here is nitrogen uptake efficiency (NUpE), which is influenced 
by the root system (the interface between plant and soil). To understand the 
natural variation of root system architecture (RSA) as a function of nitrogen 
(N) availability, a subset of the multiparent advanced generation intercross 
(MAGIC) winter wheat population WM-800 was phenotyped under two contrasting N 
treatments in a high-throughput phenotyping system at the seedling stage. 
Fourteen root and shoot traits were measured. Subsequently, these traits were 
genetically analyzed using 13,060 polymorphic haplotypes and SNPs in a 
genome-wide association study (GWAS). In total, 64 quantitative trait loci (QTL) 
were detected; 60 of them were N treatment specific. Candidate genes for the 
detected QTL included NRT1.1 and genes involved in stress signaling under N-, 
whereas candidate genes under N+ were more associated with general growth, such 
as mei2 and TaWOX11b. This finding may indicate (i) a disparity of the genetic 
control of root development under low and high N supply and, furthermore, (ii) 
the need for an N specific selection of genes and genotypes in breeding new 
wheat cultivars with improved NUpE."
948,"Leaves of guava (Psidium guajava L.) have been used in Thai folk medicine 
without any supporting evidence as a traditional herbal remedy for hair loss. 
Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is chronic hair loss caused by effects of androgens 
in those with a genetic predisposition, resulting in hair follicle 
miniaturization. Our objectives were to provide the mechanistic assessment of 
guava leaf extract on gene expressions related to the androgen pathway in 
well-known in vitro models, hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPC), and 
human prostate cancer cells (DU-145), and to determine its bioactive 
constituents and antioxidant activities. LC-MS analysis demonstrated that the 
main components of the ethanolic extract of guava leaves are phenolic 
substances, specifically catechin, gallic acid, and quercetin, which contribute 
to its scavenging and metal chelating abilities. The guava leaf extract 
substantially downregulated SRD5A1, SRD5A2, and SRD5A3 genes in the DU-145 
model, suggesting that the extract could minimize hair loss by inhibiting the 
synthesis of a potent androgen (dihydrotestosterone). SRD5A suppression by 
gallic acid and quercetin was verified. Our study reveals new perspectives on 
guava leaf extract's anti-androgen properties. This extract could be developed 
as alternative products or therapeutic adjuvants for the treatment of AGA and 
other androgen-related disorders."
949,"Brassica napus L. (canola, oil seed rape) is one of the world's most important 
oil seed crops. In the last four decades, the discovery of cytoplasmic 
male-sterility (CMS) systems and the restoration of fertility (Rf) genes in B. 
napus has improved the crop traits by heterosis. The homologs of Rf genes, known 
as the restoration of fertility-like (RFL) genes, have also gained importance 
because of their similarities with Rf genes. Such as a high 
non-synonymous/synonymous codon replacement ratio (dN/dS), autonomous gene 
duplications, and a possible engrossment in fertility restoration. B. napus 
contains 53 RFL genes on chromosomes A9 and C8. Our research aims to study the 
function of BnaRFL11 in fertility restoration using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome 
editing technique. A total of 88/108 (81.48%) T0 lines, and for T1, 110/145 
(75%) lines carried T-DNA insertions. Stable mutations were detected in the T0 
and T1 generations, with an average allelic mutation transmission rate of 81%. 
We used CRISPR-P software to detect off-target 50 plants sequenced from the T0 
generation that showed no off-target mutation, signifying that if the designed 
sgRNA is specific for the target, the off-target effects are negligible. We also 
concluded that the mutagenic competence of the designed sgRNAs mediated by U6-26 
and U6-29 ranged widely from 31% to 96%. The phenotypic analysis of bnarfl11 
revealed defects in the floral structure, leaf size, branch number, and seed 
production. We discovered a significant difference between the sterile line and 
fertile line flower development after using a stereomicroscope and scanning 
electron microscope. The pollen visibility test showed that the pollen grain had 
utterly degenerated. The cytological observations of homozygous mutant plants 
showed an anther abortion stage similar to nap-CMS, with a Orf222, Orf139, Ap3, 
and nad5c gene upregulation. The bnarfl11 shows vegetative defects, including 
fewer branches and a reduced leaf size, suggesting that PPR-encoding genes are 
essential for the plants' vegetative and reproductive growth. Our results 
demonstrated that BnaRFL11 has a possible role in fertility restoration. The 
current study's findings suggest that CRISPR/Cas9 mutations may divulge the 
functions of genes in polyploid species and provide agronomically desirable 
traits through a targeted mutation."
950,"The role of apomeiosis, parthenogenesis, and pseudogamy in the asexual 
reproduction of some plant groups has not been fully elucidated in relation to 
species diversification. Quantitative analyses of seed origin may help in 
gaining better understanding of intercytotypic interactions. Asexual 
reproduction associated with polyploidy and frequent hybridization plays a 
crucial role in the evolutionary history of the genus Crataegus in North 
America. In Europe, the genus represents a taxonomically complex and very 
difficult species group not often studied using a modern biosystematic approach. 
We investigated the reproduction pathways in mixed-cytotype populations of 
selected taxa of Crataegus in eastern Slovakia, Central Europe. The investigated 
accessions were characterized by seed production data and the ploidy level of 
mature plants as well as the embryo and endosperm tissues of their seeds 
determined via flow cytometry. Diploid and polyploid hawthorns reproduce 
successfully; they also produce high numbers of seeds. An exception is 
represented by an almost sterile triploid. Diploids reproduce sexually. 
Polyploids shift to asexual reproduction, but pseudogamy seems to be essential 
for regular seed development. In rare cases, fertilization of unreduced gametes 
occurs, which offers opportunity for the establishment of new polyploid 
cytotypes between diploid sexuals and polyploid asexuals. Opposite to sexual 
diploids, triploids are obligate, and tetraploids almost obligate apomicts. 
Apomixis is considered to help stabilize individual weakly differentiated 
polyploid microspecies. Pseudogamy is a common feature and usually leads to 
unbalanced maternal to paternal contribution in the endosperm of triploid 
accessions. Parental contribution to endosperm gene dosage is somehow relaxed in 
triploids. Our Crataegus plant system resembles reproduction in the diploids and 
polyploids of North American hawthorns. Our data provide support for the 
hypothesis that polyploidization, shifts in reproduction modes, and 
hybridization shape the genus diversity also in Central Europe."
951,"The 14-3-3 proteins, which are ubiquitous and highly conserved in eukaryotic 
cells, play an essential role in various areas of plant growth, development, and 
physiological processes. The tomato is one of the most valuable vegetable crops 
on the planet. The main objective of the present study was to perform 
genome-wide identification and analysis of the tomato 14-3-3 (SlTFT) family to 
investigate its response to different abiotic stresses and phytohormone 
treatments in order to provide valuable information for variety improvement. 
Here, 13 SlTFTs were identified using bioinformatics methods. Characterization 
showed that they were categorized into ε and non-ε groups with five and eight 
members, accounting for 38.5% and 61.5%, respectively. All the SlTFTs were 
hydrophilic, and most of them did not contain transmembrane structural domains. 
Meanwhile, the phylogeny of the SlTFTs had a strong correlation with the gene 
structure, conserved domains, and motifs. The SlTFTs showed non-random 
chromosomal distribution, and the promoter region contained more cis-acting 
elements related to abiotic stress tolerance and phytohormone responses. The 
results of the evolutionary analysis showed that the SlTFTs underwent negative 
purifying selection during evolution. Transcriptional profiling and gene 
expression pattern analysis showed that the expression levels of the SlTFTs 
varied considerably in different tissues and periods, and they played a specific 
role under various abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments. Meanwhile, the 
constructed protein-based interaction network systematically broadens our 
understanding of SlTFTs. Finally, the virus-induced gene silencing of SlTFT4 
affected the antioxidant and reactive oxygen species defense systems, increased 
the degree of cellular damage, and reduced salt resistance in tomatoes."
952,"Microtubules play a fundamental role in plant development, morphogenesis, and 
cytokinesis; they are assembled from heterodimers containing an α-tubulin (TUA) 
and a β-tubulin (TUB) protein. However, little research has been conducted on 
the TUA and TUB gene families in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In this 
study, we identified 15 TaTUA and 28 TaTUB genes in wheat. Phylogenetic analysis 
showed that 15 TaTUA genes were divided into two major subfamilies, and 28 TaTUB 
genes were divided into five major subfamilies. Mostly, there were similar motif 
compositions and exon-intron structures among the same subfamilies. Segmental 
duplication of genes (WGD/segmental) is the main process of TaTUA and TaTUB gene 
family expansion in wheat. It was found that TaTUA and TaTUB genes presented 
specific temporal and spatial characteristics based on the expression profiles 
of 17 tissues during wheat development using publicly available RNA-seq data. It 
was worth noting, via qRT-PCR, that two TaTUA and five TaTUB genes were highly 
expressed in fertile anthers compared to male sterility. These were quite 
different between physiological male sterile lines and S-type cytoplasmic male 
sterile lines at different stages of pollen development. This study offers 
fundamental information on the TUA and TUB gene families during wheat 
development and provides new insights for exploring the molecular mechanism of 
wheat male sterility."
953,"Chimeric editing is often reported in gene editing. To assess how the general 
chimeric editing is, we created a transgenic tobacco line carrying a marker, 
beta-glucuronidase gene (gusA), introduced a CRISPR-Cas9 editing vector into the 
transgenic tobacco line for knocking out gusA, and then investigated the gusA 
editing efficiencies in T0 and subsequent generations. The editing vector 
carried a Cas9 gene, which was driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S 
promoter, and two guide RNAs, gRNA1 and gRNA2, which were driven by Arabidopsis 
U6 (AtU6) and U3 (AtU3) promoter, respectively. The two gRNAs were designed to 
knock out a 42-nucleotide fragment of the coding region of gusA. The editing 
vector was transformed into gusA-containing tobacco leaves using Agrobacterium 
tumefaciens-mediated transformation and hygromycin selection. 
Hygromycin-resistant, independent T0 transgenic lines were used to evaluate 
gusA-editing efficiencies through histochemical GUS assays, polymerase chain 
reactions (PCR), and next-generation sequencing of PCR amplicons. Profiles of 
targeted sequences of 94 T0 transgenic lines revealed that these lines were 
regenerated from non-edited cells where subsequent editing occurred and created 
chimeric-edited cells in these lines during or after regeneration. Two of them 
had the target fragment of 42 bp pairs of nucleotides removed. Detail analysis 
showed that on-target mutations at the AtU6-gRNA1 site and the AtU3-gRNA2 site 
were found in 4.3% and 77.7% of T0 transgenic lines, respectively. To overcome 
the issue of extremely low editing efficiencies in T0 lines, we conducted a 
second round of shoot induction from the chimeric line(s) to enhance the success 
of obtaining lines with all or most cells edited. The mutation profiles in T0 
transgenic lines provide valuable information to understand gene editing in 
plant cells with constitutively expressed CRISPR-Cas9 and gRNAs."
954,"Shrub willows (Salix section Vetrix) are grown as a bioenergy crop in multiple 
countries and as ornamentals across the northern hemisphere. To facilitate the 
breeding and genetic advancement of shrub willow, there is a strong interest in 
the characterization and functional validation of genes involved in plant growth 
and biomass production. While protocols for shoot regeneration in tissue culture 
and production of stably transformed lines have greatly advanced this research 
in the closely related genus Populus, a lack of efficient methods for 
regeneration and transformation has stymied similar advancements in willow 
functional genomics. Moreover, transient expression assays in willow have been 
limited to callus tissue and hairy root systems. Here we report an efficient 
method for protoplast isolation from S. purpurea leaf tissue, along with 
transient overexpression and CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutations. This is the first 
such report of transient gene expression in Salix protoplasts as well as the 
first application of CRISPR technology in this genus. These new capabilities 
pave the way for future functional genomics studies in this important bioenergy 
and ornamental crop."
955,"Some European ash trees show tolerance towards dieback caused by the invasive 
pathogen Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. The microbiome of these trees harbours a range 
of specific bacterial groups. One of these groups belonging to the species 
Aureimonas altamirensis was studied in detail by genome analysis and a plant 
inoculation trial. The strain group was shown to be phylogenetically distinct 
from clinical isolates by 16S rRNA analysis and phylogenomics. Genome analysis 
of a representative strain C2P003 resulted in a large number of unique gene 
sequences in comparison to other well-studied strains of the species. A 
functional analysis of the genome revealed features associated with the 
synthesis of exopolysaccharides, protein secretion and biofilm production as 
well as genes for stress adaptation, suggesting the ability of C2P003 to 
effectively colonize ash leaves. The inoculation of ash seedlings with C2P003 
showed a significant positive effect on the plant health of the seedlings that 
were exposed to H. fraxineus infection. This effect was maintained over a period 
of three years and was accompanied by a significant shift in the bacterial 
microbiome composition one year after inoculation. Overall, the results indicate 
that C2P003 may suppress H. fraxineus in or on ash leaves via colonization 
resistance or indirectly by affecting the microbiome."
956,"Maturation imposes several changes in plants, which are particularly drastic in 
the case of trees. In recalcitrant woody species, such as chestnut (Castanea 
sativa Mill.), one of the major maturation-related shifts is the loss of the 
ability to form adventitious roots in response to auxin treatment as the plant 
ages. To analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, an in 
vitro model system of two different lines of microshoots derived from the same 
field-grown tree was established. While juvenile-like shoots root readily when 
treated with exogenous auxin, microshoots established from the crown of the tree 
rarely form roots. In the present study, a transcriptomic analysis was developed 
to compare the gene expression patterns in both types of shoots 24 h after 
hormone and wounding treatment, matching the induction phase of the process. Our 
results support the hypothesis that the inability of adult chestnut tissues to 
respond to the inductive treatment relies in a deep change of gene expression 
imposed by maturation that results in a significant transcriptome modification. 
Differences in phytohormone signaling seem to be the main cause for the 
recalcitrant behavior of mature shoots, with abscisic acid and ethylene 
negatively influencing the rooting ability of the chestnut plants. We have 
identified a set of related MADS-box genes whose expression is modified but not 
suppressed by the inductive treatment in mature shoots, suggesting a putative 
link of their activity with the rooting-recalcitrant behavior of this material. 
Overall, distinct maturation-derived auxin sensibility and homeostasis, and the 
related modifications in the balance with other phytohormones, seem to govern 
the outcome of the process in each type of shoots."
957,"The association of both cell-surface PRRs (Pattern Recognition Receptors) and 
intracellular receptor NLRs (Nucleotide-Binding Leucine-Rich Repeat) in 
engineered plants have the potential to activate strong defenses against a broad 
range of pathogens. Here, we describe the identification, characterization, and 
in planta functional analysis of a novel truncated NLR (TNx) gene from the wild 
species Arachis stenosperma (AsTIR19), with a protein structure lacking the 
C-terminal LRR (Leucine Rich Repeat) domain involved in pathogen perception. 
Overexpression of AsTIR19 in tobacco plants led to a significant reduction in 
infection caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, with a further reduction in 
pyramid lines containing an expansin-like B gene (AdEXLB8) potentially involved 
in defense priming. Transcription analysis of tobacco transgenic lines revealed 
induction of hormone defense pathways (SA; JA-ET) and PRs (Pathogenesis-Related 
proteins) production. The strong upregulation of the respiratory burst oxidase 
homolog D (RbohD) gene in the pyramid lines suggests its central role in 
mediating immune responses in plants co-expressing the two transgenes, with 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production enhanced by AdEXLB8 cues leading to 
stronger defense response. Here, we demonstrate that the association of 
potential priming elicitors and truncated NLRs can produce a synergistic effect 
on fungal resistance, constituting a promising strategy for improved, 
non-specific resistance to plant pathogens."
958,"Global warming is a serious threat to food security and severely affects plant 
growth, developmental processes, and, eventually, crop productivity. Respiratory 
metabolism plays a critical role in the adaptation of diverse stress in plants. 
Aconitase (ACO) is the main enzyme, which catalyzes the revocable isomerization 
of citrate to isocitrate in the Krebs cycle. The function of ACO gene family 
members has been extensively studied in model plants, for instance Arabidopsis. 
However, their role in plant developmental processes and various stress 
conditions largely remained unknown in other plant species. Thus, we identified 
15 ACO genes in wheat to elucidate their function in plant developmental 
processes and different stress environments. The phylogenetic tree revealed that 
TaACO genes were classified into six groups. Further, gene structure analysis of 
TaACOs has shown a distinctive evolutionary path. Synteny analysis showed the 84 
orthologous gene pairs in Brachypodium distachyon, Aegilops tauschii, Triticum 
dicoccoides, Oryza sativa, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, Ka/Ks ratio 
revealed that most TaACO genes experienced strong purifying selection during 
evolution. Numerous cis-acting regulatory elements were detected in the TaACO 
promoters, which play a crucial role in plant development processes, 
phytohormone signaling, and are related to defense and stress. To understand the 
function of TaACO genes, the expression profiling of TaACO genes were 
investigated in different tissues, developmental stages, and stress conditions. 
The transcript per million values of TaACOs genes were retrieved from the Wheat 
Expression Browser Database. We noticed the differential expression of the TaACO 
genes in different tissues and various stress conditions. Moreover, gene 
ontology analysis has shown enrichment in the tricarboxylic acid metabolic 
process (GO:0072350), citrate metabolic process (GO:0006101), isocitrate 
metabolic process GO:0006102, carbohydrate metabolic (GO:0005975), and 
glyoxylate metabolic process (GO:0046487). Therefore, this study provided 
valuable insight into the ACO gene family in wheat and contributed to the 
further functional characterization of TaACO during different plant development 
processes and various stress conditions."
959,"Harvest date is a critical parameter for producers and consumers regarding 
agro-industrial performance. It involves a pleiotropic effect controlling the 
development of other fruit quality traits through finely controlling regulatory 
mechanisms. Fruit ripening is a process in which various signals and biological 
events co-occur and are regulated by hormone signaling that produces the 
accumulation/degradation of multiple compounds. However, the regulatory 
mechanisms that control the hormone signaling involved in fruit development and 
ripening are still unclear. To investigate the issue, we used individuals with 
early, middle and late harvest dates from a peach segregating population to 
identify regulatory candidate genes controlling fruit quality traits at the 
harvest stage and validate them in contrasting peach varieties for this trait. 
We identified 467 and 654 differentially expressed genes for early and late 
harvest through a transcriptomic approach. In addition, using the Arabidopsis 
DAP-seq database and network analysis, six transcription factors were selected. 
Our results suggest significant hormonal balance and cell wall 
composition/structure differences between early and late harvest samples. Thus, 
we propose that higher expression levels of the transcription factors HB7, 
ERF017 and WRKY70 in early harvest individuals would induce the expression of 
genes associated with the jasmonic acid pathway, photosynthesis and gibberellins 
inhibition. While on the other hand, the high expression levels of LHY, CDF3 and 
NAC083 in late harvest individuals would promote the induction of genes 
associated with abscisic acid biosynthesis, auxins and cell wall remodeling."
960,"To identify new sources of effective resistance to four foliar diseases of 
wheat, 173 accessions of four wheat species, Triticum&amp;nbsp;boeoticum, T. 
urartu, T.&amp;nbsp;araraticum, and T. dicoccoides, from the VIR collection were 
tested at the juvenile and adult growth stages for resistance to leaf rust (Pt = 
Puccinia triticina), powdery mildew (Bgt = Blumeria graminis tritici), Septoria 
nodorum blotch (SNB), and dark-brown leaf spot blotch (HLB = Helminthospjrium 
leaf blotch). The accessions included new additions to the collection, some old 
samples that had never been tested before, as well as earlier tested samples 
noted for high levels of juvenile resistance to some fungal diseases. Natural 
populations of Puccinia triticina and Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, mixture 
of Parastagonospora&amp;nbsp;nodorum and Bipolaris sorokiniana isolates were 
used to inoculate and to evaluate resistance to Pt, Bgt, SNB, and HLB, 
respectively. Two samples of T.&amp;nbsp;boeoticum, three of T.&amp;nbsp;urartu, 
and one of T.&amp;nbsp;araraticum were resistant to leaf rust at both tested 
stages. Further tests (phytopathological and molecular analyses) excluded Lr9, 
Lr19, Lr24, Lr41, or Lr47 as single genes controlling resistance; hence, these 
accessions likely carry new effective leaf rust resistance genes. High level of 
Bgt resistance was identified in three entries of T.&amp;nbsp;boeoticum, one of 
T. araraticum, and eleven of T. dicoccoides. All tested accessions were 
susceptible to HLB and SNB at both tested stages. Accessions identified as 
resistant are valuable plant material for introgressive hybridization in bread 
and durum wheat breeding. The results are discussed in the context of N.I. 
Vavilov's concept of crop origin and diversity, and the laws of plant natural 
immunity to infectious diseases."
961,"Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) is an infectious ocular disease which is difficult 
to diagnose correctly and cure. Development of an effective and safe therapeutic 
drug for AK is needed. Our preliminary screening of more than 200 extracts from 
wild plants collected in Korea suggested the potential amoebicidal activity of 
Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. extract (PAE) against Acanthamoeba 
species. Here, we aimed to analyze the amoebicidal activity of PAE on 
Acanthamoeba and its underlying amoebicidal mechanism. PAE induced amoebicidal 
activity against both A. castellanii and A. polyphaga trophozoites, while it 
showed low cytotoxicity in human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-2) and human 
retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19). Transmission electron microscopy 
analysis showed subcellular morphological changes, such as increased granules, 
abnormal mitochondria, and atypical cyst wall formation, in the PAE-treated A. 
castellanii. Fluorometric apoptosis assay and TUNEL assay revealed 
apoptosis-like programmed cell death (PCD) in the PAE-treated A. castellanii. 
The PAE treatment increased reactive oxygen species production and reduced 
mitochondrial membrane potential in the amoeba. The enhanced expression of 
autophagy-associated genes was also detected. These results suggested that PAE 
exerted a promising amoebicidal effect on A. castellanii trophozoites via the 
PCD pathway. PAE could be a potential candidate for developing a therapeutic 
drug for AK."
962,"The wilt-inducing strains of Fusarium oxysporum are responsible for severe 
damage to many economically important plant species. The most cost-effective and 
environmentally safe method for the management of Fusarium wilt is the use of 
resistant cultivars when they are available. In the present study, the 
Arabidopsis genotype with disruptions in the β-amylase 3 (BAM3) gene, which 
encodes the major hydrolytic enzyme that degrades starch to maltose, had 
significantly lower susceptibility to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. raphani (For) 
compared to wild-type (wt) plants. It showed the lowest disease severity and 
contained reduced quantities of fungal DNA in the plant vascular tissues when 
analyzed with real-time PCR. Through metabolomic analysis using gas 
chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS) and gene-expression analysis by 
reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), we observed that defense 
responses of Arabidopsis bam3 mutants are associated with starch-degradation 
enzymes, the corresponding modification of the carbohydrate balance, and 
alterations in sugar (glucose, sucrose, trehalose, and myo-inositol) and auxin 
metabolism."
963,"Common valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.) is an important medicinal plant 
revealing sedative, hypotensive, anti-spasmodic and anxiolytic activity. The 
purpose of the study was to determine the intraspecific variability of the 
common valerian growing wild in Poland and the 'Lubelski' landrace, as to their 
developmental traits, chemical composition and selected genetic parameters. Both 
wild-growing populations (19) and the landrace (1) were evaluated under ex situ 
conditions. Observations of the underground organs parameters, both 
developmental and chemical (according to the European Pharmacopoeia) were 
carried out in the first year of the plant's development, while the 
characteristics of the aboveground organs, followed by the sowing value of seeds 
(according to the International Seed Testing Association)-in the second year. 
The genetic analyses were performed using the NGS-DArT-seq method. Results 
indicate the presence of five different gene pools covering the regions of 
population's origin, with a gene flow within and between them. A high level of 
developmental and chemical variabilities among the wild-growing populations was 
noticed, however without a clear relation to the region of the origin. The mass 
of underground organs ranged from 107.4 to 403.6 g FW × plant-1 with the content 
of sesquiterpenic acids at the level of 0.004-0.094%. Population no 18 was 
distinguished by the highest content of sesquiterpenic acids and the relatively 
high mass of underground organs, followed by the admixture of the gene pool, 
typical for the 'Lubelski' landrace. Unlike the 'Lubelski' landrace, the 
wild-growing populations were characterized by a high amount of an essential 
oils (3.90 to 10.04 mL/kg), which may be promising from the perspective of their 
potential use. In turn, the sowing value of the seeds obtained from the 
populations, expressed as the germinability, was rather low (25.25-62.25%)."
964,"Molecular genetic markers of various PCD (programmed cell death) variants during 
xylo- and phloemogenesis have been identified for the first time in Scots pine 
under lingonberry pine forest conditions in Northwest Russia (middle taiga 
subzone). PCD is a genetically determined process. Gene profiles of serine and 
cysteine proteases (endopeptidases), endonucleases, and metacaspases families 
are often considered markers of the final xylogenesis stage. In the present 
study, we examined the gene expression profiles of the BFN (bifunctional 
endonuclease) family-BFN, BFN1, BFN2, BFN3, and peptidase (cysteine 
endopeptidase, CEP and metacaspase, MC5) in the radial row, in addition to the 
vascular phloem and cambium (F1), differentiating xylem (F2), sapwood (SW), and 
transition zone during the active cambial growth period of uneven-aged pine 
trees (25-, 63- and 164-cambial age (c.a.) years old). We have shown that the 
expression patterns of the PCD-related genes did not depend on the cambial age 
but were largely determined by plant tissue type. In the radial row F1-F2-SW, we 
studied the activities of enzymes, including sucrose in metabolism (sucrose 
synthase, three forms of invertase); antioxidant system (AOS) enzymes 
(superoxide dismutase, catalase); and peroxidase andpolyphenol oxidase, which 
belonged to AOS enzymes and were involved in the synthesis of phenolic 
components of cell walls. The activity of the enzymes indicated that the trunk 
tissues of pine trees had varying metabolic status. Molecular genetic PCD 
regulation mechanisms during xylem vascular and mechanical element formation and 
parenchyma cells' PCD during the formation of Scots pine heartwood were 
discussed."
965,"Selenium is a micronutrient with a wide range of functions in animals, including 
humans, and in microorganisms such as microalgae. However, its role in plant 
metabolism remains ambiguous. Recent studies of Se supplementation showed that 
not only does it increase the content of the element itself, but also affects 
the accumulation of secondary metabolites in plants. The purpose of this review 
is to analyze and summarize the available data on the place of selenium in the 
secondary metabolism of plants and its effect on the accumulation of some plant 
metabolites (S- and N-containing secondary metabolites, terpenes, and phenolic 
compounds). In addition, possible molecular mechanisms and metabolic pathways 
underlying these effects are discussed. It should be noted that available data 
on the effect of Se on the accumulation of secondary metabolites are 
inconsistent and contradictory. According to some studies, selenium has a 
positive effect on the accumulation of certain metabolites, while other similar 
studies show a negative effect or no effect at all. The following aspects were 
identified as possible ways of regulating plant secondary metabolism by 
Se-supplementation: changes occurring in primary S/N metabolism, hormonal 
regulation, redox metabolism, as well as at the transcriptomic level of 
secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In all likelihood, the confusion in the 
results can be explained by other, more complex regulatory mechanisms in which 
selenium is involved and which affect the production of metabolites. Further 
study on the involvement of various forms of selenium in metabolic and signaling 
pathways is crucial for a deeper understanding of its role in growth, 
development, and health of plants, as well as the regulatory mechanisms behind 
them."
966,"Fulfilling the food demand of a fast-growing population is a global concern, 
resulting in increased dependence of the agricultural sector on various chemical 
formulations for enhancing crop production. This leads to an overuse of 
chemicals, which is not only harmful to human and animal health, but also to the 
environment and the global economy. Environmental safety and sustainable 
production are major responsibilities of the agricultural sector, which is 
inherently linked to the conservation of the biodiversity, the economy, and 
human and animal health. Scientists, therefore, across the globe are seeking to 
develop eco-friendly and cost-effective strategies to mitigate these issues by 
putting more emphasis on the use of beneficial microorganisms. Here, we review 
the literature on Serendipita indica, a beneficial endophytic fungus, to bring 
to the fore its properties of cultivation, the ability to enhance plant growth, 
improve the quality of produced crops, mitigate various plant stresses, as well 
as protect the environment. The major points in this review are as follows: (1) 
Although various plant growth promoting microorganisms are available, the 
distinguishing character of S. indica being axenically cultivable with a wide 
range of hosts makes it more interesting for research. (2) S. indica has 
numerous functions, ranging from promoting plant growth and quality to 
alleviating abiotic and biotic stresses, suggesting the use of this fungus as a 
biofertiliser. It also improves the soil quality by limiting the movement of 
heavy metals in the soil, thus, protecting the environment. (3) S. indica's 
modes of action are due to interactions with phytohormones, metabolites, 
photosynthates, and gene regulation, in addition to enhancing nutrient and water 
absorption. (4) Combined application of S. indica and nanoparticles showed 
synergistic promotion in crop growth, but the beneficial effects of these 
interactions require further investigation. This review concluded that S. indica 
has a great potential to be used as a plant growth promoter or biofertiliser, 
ensuring sustainable crop production and a healthy environment."
967,"Para rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) are the largest major source of natural 
rubber in the world. Its major pathogens are Phytophthora spp., Corynespora 
cassiicola, and Colletotrichum spp. A rubber diversity panel of 116 clones using 
over 12,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from DArTSeq genotyping 
revealed clear phylogenetic differences in clones that originated from different 
geographical regions of the world. An integrated linkage map constructed with an 
F1 progeny of 86 from an interspecific cross between H. brasiliensis and H. 
benthamiana using 23,978 markers [10,323 SNPs and 13,655 SilicoDArTs] spanned 
3947.83 cM with 0.83 cM average marker-interval. The genome scaffolds that were 
anchored to the linkage map, covering 1.44 Gb of H. brasiliensis reference 
genome, revealed a high level of collinearity between the genetic map and 
reference genome. Association analysis identified 12 SNPs significantly 
associated with the resistance against Phytophthora, Corynespora, and 
Colletotrichum in six linkage groups: 2, 6, 12, 14, 17, and 18. Kompetitive 
Allele-Specific PCR marker assays were developed for those 12 SNPs, screened 
with 178 individuals, and detected clear separation between two genotypes. 
Within the proximity to those SNPs, 41 potentially key genes that have 
previously been reported to associate with plant disease resistance were 
predicted with high confidence."
968,"As worldwide warming intensifies, the average temperature of the earth continues 
to increase. Temperature is a key factor for the growth and development of all 
organisms and governs the distribution and seasonal behavior of plants. High 
temperatures lead to various biochemical, physiological, and morphological 
changes in plants and threaten plant productivity. As sessile organisms, plants 
are subjected to various hostile environmental factors and forced to change 
their cellular state and morphological architecture to successfully deal with 
the damage they suffer. Therefore, plants have evolved multiple strategies to 
cope with an abnormal rise in temperature. There are two main mechanisms by 
which plants respond to elevated environmental temperatures. One is the heat 
stress response, which is activated under extremely high temperatures; the other 
is the thermomorphogenesis response, which is activated under moderately 
elevated temperatures, below the heat-stress range. In this review, we summarize 
recent progress in the study of these two important heat-responsive molecular 
regulatory pathways mediated, respectively, by the Heat Shock Transcription 
Factor (HSF)-Heat Shock Protein (HSP) pathway and PHYTOCHROME INTER-ACTING 
FACTOR 4 (PIF4) pathways in plants and elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of 
the genes involved in these pathways to provide comprehensive data for 
researchers studying the heat response. We also discuss future perspectives in 
this field."
969,"The growing interest in natural bioactive molecules, as an approach to many 
pathological contexts, is widely justified by the necessity to overcome the 
disadvantageous benefit-risk ratio related to traditional therapies. Among them, 
mangiferin (MGF) shows promising beneficial properties such as antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. In this study, we aimed to 
investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of MGF on 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung NCI-H292 cells, focusing on its role 
against COVID-19 adsorption. In order to obtain this information, cells treated 
with LPS, with or without MGF, were analyzed performing wound healing, gene 
expression of inflammatory cytokines, GSH quantification, and JC-1 staining. 
Moreover, the inhibition of viral adsorption was evaluated microbiologically and 
the results were further confirmed by molecular docking analysis. In this 
regard, MGF downregulates the expression of several inflammatory factors, 
enhances GSH levels, promotes the wound healing rate, and restores the 
mitochondrial dysfunction caused by LPS. In addition, MGF significantly inhibits 
SARS-CoV-2 adsorption as shown by the gene expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS-2, and 
furtherly confirmed by microbiological and molecular modeling evaluation. 
Although more investigations are still needed, all data obtained constitute a 
solid background, demonstrating the cytoprotective role of MGF in inflammatory 
mechanisms including COVID-19 infection."
970,"For peripherally administered drugs to reach the central nervous system (CNS) 
and treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), they must cross the blood-brain 
barrier (BBB). As mounting evidence suggests that the ultrastructure of the BBB 
is altered in individuals with ALS and in animal models of ALS (e.g., SOD1G93A 
mice), we characterized BBB transporter expression and function in transgenic 
C9orf72 BAC (C9-BAC) mice expressing a hexanucleotide repeat expansion, the most 
common genetic cause of ALS. Using an in situ transcardiac brain perfusion 
technique, we identified a 1.4-fold increase in 3H-2-deoxy-D-glucose transport 
across the BBB in C9-BAC transgenic (C9) mice, relative to wild-type (WT) mice, 
which was associated with a 1.3-fold increase in brain microvascular glucose 
transporter 1 expression, while other general BBB permeability processes 
(passive diffusion, efflux transporter function) remained unaffected. We also 
performed proteomic analysis on isolated brain microvascular endothelial cells, 
in which we noted a mild (14.3%) reduction in zonula occludens-1 abundance in C9 
relative to WT mice. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted trends in 
changes to various BBB transporters and cellular metabolism. To our knowledge, 
this is the first study to demonstrate altered BBB function in a C9orf72 repeat 
expansion model of ALS, which has implications on how therapeutics may access 
the brain in this mouse model."
971,"Lung cancer is a common malignancy worldwide, with high morbidity and mortality. 
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an important 
transcription factor that not only regulates different hallmarks of cancer, such 
as tumorigenesis, cell proliferation, and metastasis but also regulates the 
occurrence and maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Abnormal STAT3 activity 
has been found in a variety of cancers, including lung cancer, and its 
phosphorylation level is associated with a poor prognosis of lung cancer. 
Therefore, the STAT3 pathway may represent a promising therapeutic target for 
the treatment of lung cancer. To date, various types of STAT3 inhibitors, 
including natural compounds, small molecules, and gene-based therapies, have 
been developed through direct and indirect strategies, although most of them are 
still in the preclinical or early clinical stages. One of the main obstacles to 
the development of STAT3 inhibitors is the lack of an effective targeted 
delivery system to improve their bioavailability and tumor targetability, 
failing to fully demonstrate their anti-tumor effects. In this review, we will 
summarize the recent advances in STAT3 targeting strategies, as well as the 
applications of nanoparticle-mediated targeted delivery of STAT3 inhibitors in 
the treatment of lung cancer."
972,"Aptamer-drug conjugates (ApDCs) are potential targeted pharmaceutics, but their 
clinical applications are hampered by fast clearance in blood. Herein we report 
the construction of ApDCs modified with artificial base F and the study of 
biological activities. Two types of F-base-modified ApDCs were prepared, 
Sgc8-paclitaxel by conjugation and Sgc8-gemcitabine, by automated solid-phase 
synthesis. In vitro experiments showed that F-base-modified ApDCs retain the 
specificity of the aptamer to target cells and the biological stability is 
improved. In vivo studies demonstrated that the circulatory time is increased by 
up to 55 h or longer, as the incorporated F base leads to a stable ApDC-albumin 
complex as the formulation for targeted delivery. Moreover, conjugated drug 
molecules were released efficiently and the drug (paclitaxel) concentration in 
the tumor site was improved. The results demonstrate that an F-base-directed 
ApDC-albumin complex is a potential platform for drug delivery and targeted 
cancer therapy."
973,"Mutations in the CSF1R gene are the most common cause of adult-onset 
leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a 
neurodegenerative disease with rapid progression and ominous prognosis. 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been increasingly offered to 
patients with CSF1R-ALSP. However, different therapy results were observed, and 
it was not elucidated which patient should be referred for HSCT. This study 
aimed to determine predictors of good and bad HSCT outcomes in CSF1R-ALSP. We 
retrospectively analyzed 15 patients, 14 symptomatic and 1 asymptomatic, with 
CSF1R-ALSP that underwent HSCT. Median age of onset was 39 years, and the median 
age of HSCT was 43 years. Cognitive impairment was the most frequent initial 
manifestation (43%), followed by gait problems (21%) and neuropsychiatric 
symptoms (21%). Median post-HSCT follow-up was 26 months. Good outcomes were 
associated with gait problems as initial (p = 0.041) and predominant (p = 0.017) 
manifestation and younger age at HSCT (p = 0.044). Cognitive impairment as first 
manifestation was a predictor of a bad outcome (p = 0.016) and worsening of 
cognition post-HSCT (p = 0.025). In conclusion, gait problems indicated a milder 
phenotype with better response to HSCT and good therapy outcomes. In contrast, 
patients with a higher burden of cognitive symptoms were most likely not to 
benefit from HSCT."
974,"Currently, selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) are considered potential 
immunomodulatory agents and as targets for activity modulation are granulocytes, 
which have the most abundant population of immune blood cells. The present study 
aims to evaluate the cytotoxic effect and its effect on the functional responses 
of granulocytes. In addition to the intrinsic activity of SeNPs, we studied the 
activity of the combination of SeNPs and IgG antibodies. Using laser ablation 
and fragmentation, we obtained nanoparticles with an average size of 100 nm and 
a rather narrow size evolution. The resulting nanoparticles do not show acute 
toxicity to primary cultures of fibroblasts and hepatocytes, epithelial-like 
cell line L-929 and granulocyte-like culture of HL-60 at a concentration of 109 
NPs/mL. SeNPs at a concentration of 1010 NPs/mL reduced the viability of HL-60 
cells by no more than 10% and did not affect the viability of the primary 
culture of mouse granulocytes, and did not have a genotoxic effect on progenitor 
cells. The addition of SeNPs can affect the production of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) by mouse bone marrow granulocytes, modulate the proportion of 
granulocytes with calcium spikes and enhance fMLF-induced granulocytes 
degranulation. SeNPs can modulate the effect of IgG on the physiological 
responses of granulocytes. We studied the expression level of genes associated 
with inflammation and cell stress. SeNPs increase the expression of catalase, 
NF-κB, Xrcc5 and some others; antibodies enhance the effect of SeNPs, but IgG 
without SeNPs decreases the expression level of these genes. This fact can be 
explained by the interaction between SeNPs and IgG. It has been established that 
antibodies interact with SeNPs. We showed that antibodies bind to the surface of 
selenium nanoparticles and are present in aqueous solutions in a bound form from 
DLS methods, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, vibrational-rotational 
spectrometry, fluorescence spectrometry, and refractometry. At the same time, in 
a significant part of the antibodies, a partial change in the tertiary and 
secondary structure is observed. The data obtained will allow a better 
understanding of the principles of the interaction of immune cells with 
antibodies and SeNPs and, in the future, may serve to create a new generation of 
immunomodulators."
975,"PURPOSE: Many natural agents have a high anticancer potential, and their 
combination may be advantageous for improved anticancer effects. Such agents, 
however, often are not water soluble and do not efficiently target cancer cells, 
and the kinetics of their action is poorly controlled. One way to overcome these 
barriers is to combine natural agents with nanoparticles. Our aim in the current 
study was to fabricate an anticancer nanoformulation for co-delivery of two 
natural agents, curcumin (CR) and colchicine (CL), with a core-shell structure. 
Using cancer cell lines, we compared the anticancer efficacy between the 
combination and a nanoformulation with CL alone.
METHODS: For the single-drug nanoformulation, we used phosphonate groups to 
functionalize mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and loaded the MSNs with 
CL. Additional loading of this nanoformulation with CR achieved the co-delivery 
format. To create the structure with a core shell, we selected a 
chitosan-cellulose mixture conjugated with targeting ligands of folic acid for 
the coating. For evaluating anticancer and apoptosis effects, we assessed 
changes in important genes and proteins in apoptosis (p53, caspase-3, Bax, 
Bcl-2) in several cell lines (MCF-7, breast adenocarcinoma; HCT-116, colon 
carcinoma; HOS, human osteosarcoma; and A-549, non-small cell lung cancer).
RESULTS: Nanoformulations were successfully synthesized and contained 10.9 wt.% 
for the CL single-delivery version and 18.1 wt.% for the CL+CR co-delivery 
nanoformulation. Anticancer effects depended on treatment, cell line, and 
concentration. Co-delivery nanoformulations exerted anticancer effects that were 
significantly superior to those of single delivery or free CL or CR. Anticancer 
effects by cell line were in the order of HCT-116 &gt; A549 &gt; HOS &gt; MCF-7. 
The lowest IC50 value was obtained for the nanoformulation consisting of CL and 
CR coated with a polymeric shell conjugated with FA (equivalent to 4.1 ± 0.05 
µg/mL). With dual delivery compared with the free agents, we detected strongly 
increased p53, caspase-3, and Bax expression, but inhibition of Bcl-2, 
suggesting promotion of apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, although preliminary, indicate that the proposed dual 
delivery nanoformulation consisting of nanocore: MSNs loaded with CL and CR and 
coated with a shell of chitosan-cellulose conjugated folic acid exerted strong 
anticancer and apoptotic effects with potent antitumor activity against HCT-116 
colon cells. The effect bested CL alone. Evaluating and confirming the efficacy 
of co-delivery nanoformulations will require in vivo studies."
976,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of systemic disorders threatening human 
health with complex pathogenesis, among which mitochondrial energy metabolism 
reprogramming has a critical role. Mitochondria are cell organelles that fuel 
the energy essential for biochemical reactions and maintain normal physiological 
functions of the body. Mitochondrial metabolic disorders are extensively 
involved in the progression of CVD, especially for energy-demanding organs such 
as the heart. Therefore, elucidating the role of mitochondrial metabolism in the 
progression of CVD is of great significance to further understand the 
pathogenesis of CVD and explore preventive and therapeutic methods. In this 
review, we discuss the major factors of mitochondrial metabolism and their 
potential roles in the prevention and treatment of CVD. The current application 
of mitochondria-targeted therapeutic agents in the treatment of CVD and advances 
in mitochondria-targeted gene therapy technologies are also overviewed."
977,"Perhaps the greatest limitation for the continually advancing developments in 
cancer immunotherapy remains the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). 
The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) axis 
is an emerging immunotherapy target, with the resulting type I interferons and 
transcription factors acting at several levels in both tumor and immune cells 
for the generation of adaptive T cell responses. The cGAS-STING axis activation 
by therapeutic agents that induce DNA damage, such as certain chemotherapies, 
continues to be reported, highlighting the importance of the interplay of this 
signaling pathway and the DNA damage response in cancer immunity/immunotherapy. 
We have developed a multi-targeted mannosylated cationic liposomal 
immunomodulatory system (DS) which contains low doses of the chemotherapeutic 
cytarabine (Ara-C). In this work, we show that entrapment of non-cytotoxic doses 
of Ara-C within the DS improves its ability to induce DNA double strand breaks 
in human ovarian and colorectal cancer cell lines, as well as in various immune 
cells. Importantly, for the first time we demonstrate that the DNA damage 
induced by Ara-C/DS translates into cGAS-STING axis activation. We further 
demonstrate that Ara-C/DS-mediated DNA damage leads to upregulation of surface 
expression of immune ligands on cancer cells, coinciding with priming of 
cytotoxic lymphocytes as assessed using an ex vivo model of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells from colorectal cancer patients, as well as an in vitro NK 
cell model. Overall, the results highlight a broad immunotherapeutic potential 
for Ara-C/DS by enhancing tumor-directed inflammatory responses."
978,"The exact mechanisms of nucleic acid (NA) delivery with gene electrotransfer 
(GET) are still unknown, which represents a limitation for its broader use. 
Further, not knowing the effects that different experimental electrical and 
biological parameters have on GET additionally hinders GET optimization, 
resulting in the majority of research being performed using a trial-and-error 
approach. To explore the current state of knowledge, we conducted a systematic 
literature review of GET papers in in vitro conditions and performed 
meta-analyses of the reported GET efficiency. For now, there is no universal GET 
strategy that would be appropriate for all experimental aims. Apart from the 
availability of the required electroporation device and electrodes, the choice 
of an optimal GET approach depends on parameters such as the electroporation 
medium; type and origin of cells; and the size, concentration, promoter, and 
type of the NA to be transfected. Equally important are appropriate controls and 
the measurement or evaluation of the output pulses to allow a fair and unbiased 
evaluation of the experimental results. Since many experimental electrical and 
biological parameters can affect GET, it is important that all used parameters 
are adequately reported to enable the comparison of results, as well as 
potentially faster and more efficient experiment planning and optimization."
979,"Streptococcus pyogenes is one of the most common bacteria causing sinusitis in 
children and adult patients. Probiotics are known to cause antagonistic effects 
on S. pyogenes growth and biofilm formation. In the present study, we 
demonstrated the anti-biofilm and anti-virulence properties of 
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum KAU007 against S. pyogenes ATCC 8668. The 
antibacterial potential of L. plantarum KAU007 metabolite extract (LME) purified 
from the cell-free supernatant of L. plantarum KAU007 was evaluated in terms of 
minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations 
(MBC). LME was further analyzed for its anti-biofilm potential using crystal 
violet assay and microscopic examination. Furthermore, the effect of LME was 
tested on the important virulence attributes of S. pyogenes, such as secreted 
protease production, hemolysis, extracellular polymeric substance production, 
and cell surface hydrophobicity. Additionally, the impact of LME on the 
expression of genes associated with biofilm formation and virulence attributes 
was analyzed using qPCR. The results revealed that LME significantly inhibited 
the growth and survival of S. pyogenes at a low concentration (MIC, 9.76 µg/mL; 
MBC, 39.06 µg/mL). Furthermore, LME inhibited biofilm formation and mitigated 
the production of extracellular polymeric substance at a concentration of 4.88 
μg/mL in S. pyogenes. The results obtained from qPCR and biochemical assays 
advocated that LME suppresses the expression of various critical 
virulence-associated genes, which correspondingly affect various pathogenicity 
markers and were responsible for the impairment of virulence and biofilm 
formation in S. pyogenes. The non-hemolytic nature of LME and its anti-biofilm 
and anti-virulence properties against S. pyogenes invoke further investigation 
to study the role of LME as an antibacterial agent to combat streptococcal 
infections."
980,"In this article, we used monolayer two dimensional (2D) and 3D multicellular 
spheroid models to improve our understanding of the gene delivery process of a 
new modified cationic hyper-branched cyclodextrin-based polymer (Ppoly)-loaded 
plasmid encoding Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP). A comparison between 
the cytotoxicity effect and transfection efficiency of the plasmid DNA 
(pDNA)-loaded Ppoly system in 2D and 3D spheroid cells determined that the 
transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity of Ppoly-pDNA nanocomplexes were lower 
in 3D spheroids than in 2D monolayer cells. Furthermore, histopathology 
visualization of Ppoly-pDNA complex cellular uptake in 3D spheroids demonstrated 
that Ppoly penetrated into the inner layers. This study indicated that the 
Ppoly, as a non-viral gene delivery system in complex with pDNA, is 
hemocompatible, non-toxic, high in encapsulation efficiency, and has good 
transfection efficiency in both 2D and 3D cell cultures compared to free pDNA 
and lipofectamine (as the control)."
981,"Interaction between cationic surfactants and nucleic acids attracts much 
attention due to the possibility of using such systems for gene delivery. 
Herein, the lipoplexes based on cationic surfactants with imidazolium head group 
bearing methoxyphenyl fragment (MPI-n, n = 10, 12, 14, 16) and nucleic acids 
(oligonucleotide and plasmid DNA) were explored. The complex formation was 
confirmed by dynamic/electrophoretic light scattering, transmission electron 
microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and gel 
electrophoresis. The nanosized lipoplex formation (of about 100-200 nm), 
contributed by electrostatic, hydrophobic interactions, and intercalation 
mechanism, has been shown. Significant effects of the hydrocarbon tail length of 
surfactant and the type of nucleic acid on their interaction was revealed. The 
cytotoxic effect and transfection ability of lipoplexes studied were determined 
using M-HeLa, A549 cancer cell lines, and normal Chang liver cells. A selective 
reduced cytotoxic effect of the complexes on M-HeLa cancer cells was 
established, as well as a high ability of the systems to be transfected into 
cancer cells. MPI-n/DNA complexes showed a pronounced transfection activity 
equal to the commercial preparation Lipofectamine 3000. Thus, it has been shown 
that MPI-n surfactants are effective agents for nucleic acid condensation and 
can be considered as potential non-viral vectors for gene delivery."
982,"Messenger RNA (mRNA), which is composed of ribonucleotides that carry genetic 
information and direct protein synthesis, is transcribed from a strand of DNA as 
a template. On this basis, mRNA technology can take advantage of the body's own 
translation system to express proteins with multiple functions for the treatment 
of various diseases. Due to the advancement of mRNA synthesis and purification, 
modification and sequence optimization technologies, and the emerging lipid 
nanomaterials and other delivery systems, mRNA therapeutic regimens are becoming 
clinically feasible and exhibit significant reliability in mRNA stability, 
translation efficiency, and controlled immunogenicity. Lipid nanoparticles 
(LNPs), currently the leading non-viral delivery vehicles, have made many 
exciting advances in clinical translation as part of the COVID-19 vaccines and 
therefore have the potential to accelerate the clinical translation of gene 
drugs. Additionally, due to their small size, biocompatibility, and 
biodegradability, LNPs can effectively deliver nucleic acids into cells, which 
is particularly important for the current mRNA regimens. Therefore, the 
cutting-edge LNP@mRNA regimens hold great promise for cancer vaccines, 
infectious disease prevention, protein replacement therapy, gene editing, and 
rare disease treatment. To shed more lights on LNP@mRNA, this paper mainly 
discusses the rational of choosing LNPs as the non-viral vectors to deliver 
mRNA, the general rules for mRNA optimization and LNP preparation, and the 
various parameters affecting the delivery efficiency of LNP@mRNA, and finally 
summarizes the current research status as well as the current challenges. The 
latest research progress of LNPs in the treatment of other diseases such as 
oncological, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases is also given. Finally, the 
future applications and perspectives for LNP@mRNA are generally introduced."
983,"In endothelial cells, microRNA-126 (miR-126) promotes angiogenesis, and 
modulating the intracellular levels of this gene could suggest a method to treat 
cardiovascular diseases such as ischemia. Novel ultrasound-stimulated 
microbubbles offer a means to deliver therapeutic payloads to target cells and 
sites of disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility 
of gene delivery by stimulating miR-126-decorated microbubbles using gentle 
acoustic conditions (stable cavitation). A cationic DSTAP microbubble was 
formulated and characterized to carry 6 µg of a miR-126 payload per 109 
microbubbles. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated at 
20-40% duty cycle with miR-126-conjugated microbubbles in a custom ultrasound 
setup coupled with a passive cavitation detection system. Transfection 
efficiency was assessed by RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and endothelial tube 
formation assay, while HUVEC viability was monitored by MTT assay. With 
increasing duty cycle, the trend observed was an increase in intracellular 
miR-126 levels, up to a 2.3-fold increase, as well as a decrease in SPRED1 (by 
33%) and PIK3R2 (by 46%) expression, two salient miR-126 targets. Under these 
ultrasound parameters, HUVECs maintained &gt;95% viability after 96 h. The 
present work describes the delivery of a proangiogenic miR-126 using an 
ultrasound-responsive cationic microbubble with potential to stimulate 
therapeutic angiogenesis while minimizing endothelial damage."
984,"Oligonucleotide therapeutics that can modulate gene expression have been 
gradually developed for clinical applications over several decades. However, 
rapid advances have been made in recent years. Artificial nucleic acid 
technology has overcome many challenges, such as (1) poor target affinity and 
selectivity, (2) low in vivo stability, and (3) classical side effects, such as 
immune responses; thus, its application in a wide range of disorders has been 
extensively examined. However, even highly optimized oligonucleotides exhibit 
side effects, which limits the general use of this class of agents. In this 
review, we discuss the physicochemical characteristics that aid interactions 
between drugs and molecules that belong to living organisms. By systematically 
organizing the related data, we hope to explore avenues for symbiotic 
engineering of oligonucleotide therapeutics that will result in more effective 
and safer drugs."
985,"Clomiphene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has been used for 
the treatment of anovulation for more than 50 years. However, since 
(E)-clomiphene ((E)-Clom) and its metabolites are eliminated primarily via 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and CYP3A4, exposure can be affected by CYP2D6 
polymorphisms and concomitant use with CYP inhibitors. Thus, clomiphene therapy 
may be susceptible to drug-gene interactions (DGIs), drug-drug interactions 
(DDIs) and drug-drug-gene interactions (DDGIs). Physiologically based 
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a tool to quantify such DGI and DD(G)I 
scenarios. This study aimed to develop a whole-body PBPK model of (E)-Clom 
including three important metabolites to describe and predict DGI and DD(G)I 
effects. Model performance was evaluated both graphically and by calculating 
quantitative measures. Here, 90% of predicted Cmax and 80% of AUClast values 
were within two-fold of the corresponding observed value for DGIs and DD(G)Is 
with clarithromycin and paroxetine. The model also revealed quantitative 
contributions of different CYP enzymes to the involved metabolic pathways of 
(E)-Clom and its metabolites. The developed PBPK model can be employed to assess 
the exposure of (E)-Clom and its active metabolites in as-yet unexplored DD(G)I 
scenarios in future studies."
986,"Cationic surfactants have great potential as drug vehicles and for use in gene 
therapy (cationic vesicles made from cationic surfactants can encapsulate RNA or 
DNA for cellular transfer). They can also be used as antimicrobial and 
antifungal agents to treat human infections. In an era of increasing 
antimicrobial resistance, the development of new biocompatible surfactants 
suitable for application as antimicrobial agents is of high interest. In this 
work, a library of amino acid-based surfactants was synthesized, characterized 
and tested for antimicrobial activity. The head group architecture (number and 
type of amino acids, density of cationic charge, ionic character) and the 
hydrophobic moiety (alkyl chain length and position of the hydrophobic group) 
were systematically modified, and the effect on the surfactant biological and 
aggregation behavior was studied. Thus, the pKa values, micellization process, 
antimicrobial efficiency and biodegradability were evaluated. The critical 
micelle concentration values of the surfactants depended on their hydrophobic 
character, but changes in the polar head as well as the position and length of 
the alkyl chain also significantly affected activity against some of the tested 
microorganisms. Moreover, biodegradability was closely related to the 
hydrophobic character of the surfactant and attachment of the alkyl chain to the 
polar head. The structure-activity relationships established here may open 
perspectives for the design of effective biodegradable antimicrobial materials 
that can overcome emerging resistance."
987,"Hepatocellular carcinoma is the seventh most common type of cancer in the world, 
with limited treatment options. A promising strategy to treat cancer is to 
associate chemotherapeutics and plant bioactive compounds. Here, we examined 
whether diallyl disulfide (DADS; 50-200 μM) and sorafenib (SORA; 8 μM), either 
alone or in combination, were toxic to hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) in 
vitro. We assessed whether DADS and/or SORA induced cell death (LIVE/DEAD assay 
and autophagy) and cell cycle changes (flow cytometry), altered expression of 
key genes and proteins (RT-qPCR and Western blot), and modulated tumorigenesis 
signatures, such as proliferation (clonogenic assay), migration (wound healing), 
and invasion (inserts). The DADS + SORA combination elicited autophagic cell 
death by upregulating LC3 and NRF2 expression and downregulating FOS and TNF 
expression; induced the accumulation of cells in the G1 phase which thereby 
upregulated the CHEK2 expression; and inhibited invasion by downregulating the 
MMP2 expression. Predictive analysis indicated the participation of the MAPK 
pathway in the reported results. The DADS + SORA combination suppressed both 
cell invasion and clonogenic survival, which indicated that it dampened tumor 
growth, proliferation, invasion, and metastatic potential. Therefore, the DADS + 
SORA combination is a promising therapy to develop new clinical protocols."
988,"This study systematically reviews and characterizes the existing literature on 
transferrin/transferrin receptor-mediated drug delivery. Transferrin is an 
iron-binding protein. It can be used as a ligand to deliver various proteins, 
genes, ions, and drugs to the target site via transferrin receptors for 
therapeutic or diagnostic purposes via transferrin receptors. This study is 
based on a cross-sectional bibliometric analysis of 583 papers limited to the 
subject areas of pharmacology, toxicology, and pharmaceutics as extracted from 
the Scopus database in mid-September 2022. The data were analyzed, and we 
carried out a performance analysis and science mapping. There was a significant 
increase in research from 2018 onward. The countries that contributed the most 
were the USA and China, and most of the existing research was found to be from 
single-country publications. Research studies on transferrin/transferrin 
receptor-mediated drug delivery focus on drug delivery across the blood-brain 
barrier in the form of nanoparticles. The thematic analysis revealed four 
themes: transferrin/transferrin receptor-mediated drug delivery to the brain, 
cancer cells, gene therapy, nanoparticles, and liposomes as drug delivery 
systems. This study is relevant to academics, practitioners, and decision makers 
interested in targeted and site-specific drug delivery."
989,"BACKGROUND: Human cell-secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) are versatile 
nanomaterials suitable for disease-targeted drug delivery and therapy. Native 
EVs, however, usually do not interact specifically with target cells or harbor 
therapeutic drugs, which limits their potential for clinical applications. These 
functions can be introduced to EVs by genetic manipulation of membrane protein 
scaffolds, although the efficiency of these manipulations and the impacts they 
have on the properties of EVs are for the most part unknown. In this study, we 
quantify the effects of genetic manipulations of different membrane scaffolds on 
the physicochemical properties, molecular profiles, and cell uptake of the EVs.
METHODS: Using a combination of gene fusion, molecular imaging, and immuno-based 
on-chip analysis, we examined the effects of various protein scaffolds, 
including endogenous tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, and CD81) and exogenous vesicular 
stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG), on the efficiency of integration in EV 
membranes, the physicochemical properties of EVs, and EV uptake by recipient 
cells.
RESULTS: Fluorescence imaging and live cell monitoring showed each scaffold type 
was integrated into EVs either in membranes of the endocytic compartment, the 
plasma membrane, or both. Analysis of vesicle size revealed that the 
incorporation of each scaffold increased the average diameter of vesicles 
compared to unmodified EVs. Molecular profiling of surface markers in engineered 
EVs using on-chip assays showed the CD63-GFP scaffold decreased expression of 
CD81 on the membrane surface compared to control EVs, whereas its expression was 
mostly unchanged in EVs bearing CD9-, CD81-, or VSVG-GFP. The results from cell 
uptake studies demonstrated that VSVG-engineered EVs were taken up by recipient 
cells to a greater degree than control EVs.
CONCLUSION: We found that the incorporation of different molecular scaffolds in 
EVs altered their physicochemical properties, surface protein profiles, and 
cell-uptake functions. Scaffold-induced changes in the physical and functional 
properties of engineered EVs should therefore be considered in engineering EVs 
for the targeted delivery and uptake of therapeutics to diseased cells."
990,"Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs) block estrogen production and improve survival in 
patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. However, half of patients 
develop aromatase-inhibitor-induced arthralgia (AIIA), which is characterized by 
inflammation of the joints and the surrounding musculoskeletal tissue. To create 
a platform for future interventional strategies, our objective was to 
characterize a novel animal model of AIIA. Female BALB/C-Tg(NFκB-RE-luc)-Xen 
mice, which have a firefly luciferase NFκB reporter gene, were oophorectomized 
and treated with an AI (letrozole). Bioluminescent imaging showed significantly 
enhanced NFκB activation with AI treatment in the hind limbs. Moreover, an 
analysis of the knee joints and legs via MRI showed enhanced signal detection in 
the joint space and the surrounding tissue. Surprisingly, the responses observed 
with AI treatment were independent of oophorectomy, indicating that inflammation 
is not mediated by physiological estrogen levels. Histopathological and 
pro-inflammatory cytokine analyses further demonstrated the same trend, as 
tenosynovitis and musculoskeletal infiltrates were detected in all mice 
receiving AI, and serum cytokines were significantly upregulated. Human PBMCs 
treated with letrozole/estrogen combinations did not demonstrate an AI-specific 
gene expression pattern, suggesting AIIA-mediated pathogenesis through other 
cell types. Collectively, these data identify an AI-induced stimulation of 
disease pathology and suggest that AIIA pathogenesis may not be mediated by 
estrogen deficiency, as previously hypothesized."
991,"Cydonia Oblonga Mill. is widely distributed in Turkey, Uzbekistan and China and 
commonly used by the food industry to produce jam, jelly and candies. The aim of 
this study was to investigate the in vitro antidiabetic activity and 
anti-diabetic mechanism of Cydonia Oblonga Mill. fruit (COMF). The chemical 
compositions were further characterized in COMF by UPLC-Q-Orbitrap/MS and 65 
components including 22 flavonoids, 16 organic acids, 11 polyphenols, 5 amino 
acids, 3 pentacyclic triterpenoids and 8 other compounds were identified. The 
antioxidant activity by DPPH scavenging method and α-glucosidase inhibitory 
activity were tested. Furthermore, we detected the effects of COMF extract on 
the proliferation activity of HUVECs, cell viability of HUVECs under 
H2O2-induced oxidative stress, and NO production. Then, molecular docking 
activity and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of seven key flavonoid components 
selected by bioinformatics analysis and literature in the COMF were studied. 
Among them, quercetin showed potent inhibitory activity, kaempferol, 
isorhamnetin, luteolin and apigenin demonstrated moderate inhibitory activity, 
while rutin and epicatechin exhibited poor inhibitory activity. Subsequently, 
the effects of quercetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, leteolin and apigenin on the 
gene expression levels of AKT1, IL-6 and VEGFA were verified by real-time 
fluorescence quantification (RT-qPCR). Molecular biology result showed that 
different active ingredients can significantly recover the levels of AKT1, IL-6 
and VEGFA in HUVECs injured by high glucose."
992,"The advancement of high-throughput sequencing and genomic analysis revealed that 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a genetically heterogeneous disease. The 
abundance of such genetic data in ALL can also be utilized to identify potential 
targets for drug discovery and even drug repurposing. We aimed to determine 
potential genes for drug development and further guide the identification of 
candidate drugs repurposed for treating ALL through integrated genomic network 
analysis. Genetic variants associated with ALL were retrieved from the GWAS 
Catalog. We further applied a genomic-driven drug repurposing approach based on 
the six functional annotations to prioritize crucial biological ALL-related 
genes based on the scoring system. Lastly, we identified the potential drugs in 
which the mechanisms overlapped with the therapeutic targets and prioritized the 
candidate drugs using Connectivity Map (CMap) analysis. Forty-two genes were 
considered biological ALL-risk genes with ARID5B topping the list. Based on 
potentially druggable genes that we identified, palbociclib, sirolimus, and 
tacrolimus were under clinical trial for ALL. Additionally, chlorprothixene, 
sirolimus, dihydroergocristine, papaverine, and tamoxifen are the top five drug 
repositioning candidates for ALL according to the CMap score with dasatinib as a 
comparator. In conclusion, this study determines the practicability and the 
potential of integrated genomic network analysis in driving drug discovery in 
ALL."
993,"Lung inflammation is associated with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines. Treatment with FCBD:std (standard mix of cannabidiol [CBD], 
cannabigerol [CBG] and tetrahydrocannabivarin [THCV]) leads to a marked 
reduction in the inflammation of alveolar epithelial cells, but not in 
macrophages. In the present study, the combined anti-inflammatory effect of 
FCBD:std with two corticosteroids (dexamethasone and budesonide) and two 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID; ibuprofen and diclofenac), was 
examined. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine 
protein levels. Gene expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. 
Inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) activity was determined in vitro. FCBD:std 
and diclofenac act synergistically, reducing IL-8 levels in macrophages and lung 
epithelial cells. FCBD:std plus diclofenac also reduced IL-6, IL-8 and CCL2 
expression levels in co-cultures of macrophages and lung epithelial cells, in 2D 
and 3D models. Treatment by FCBD:std and/or NSAID reduced COX-1 and COX-2 gene 
expression but not their enzymatic activity. FCBD:std and diclofenac exhibit 
synergistic anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages and lung epithelial cells, 
yet this combined activity needs to be examined in pre-clinical studies and 
clinical trials."
994,"Progranulin (PGRN) is a glycoprotein formed by 593 amino acids encoded by the 
GRN gene. It has an important role in immunity and inflammatory response, as 
well as in tissue recovery. Its role in musculoskeletal inflammatory diseases 
such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 
intervertebral disc degeneration disease (IVDD), is, nowadays, an important 
target to investigate. The objective of this review is to systematically sum up 
all the recent findings concerning PGRN as a target in the development and 
resolution of the inflammatory diseases. PubMed was examined with the terms 
combinations (Progranulin) AND (Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic), (Progranulin) 
AND (Arthritis, Rheumatoid), and (Progranulin) AND (Intervertebral Disc 
Degeneration). PubMed was examined with the terms combinations (Atsttrin) AND 
(Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic), (Atsttrin) AND (Arthritis, Rheumatoid), and 
(Atsttrin) AND (Intervertebral Disc Degeneration). Moreover, research through 
Web of Science was performed searching the same items. The inclusion criteria 
were: studies whose main topic were progranulin, or atsttrin, with emphasis on 
the three selected diseases. On the other hand, the exclusion criteria were 
studies that only focused on diseases not related to RA, lupus or IVDD, in 
addition to the previous published literature reviews. Since few results were 
obtained, we did not filter by year. The records assessed for eligibility were 
23, including all the studies with the information in state of art of 
progranulin and its capability to be a potential target or treatment for each 
one of the selected diseases. As these results are descriptive and not clinical 
trials, we did not perform risk of bias methods. Within these results, many 
studies have shown an anti-inflammatory activity of PGRN in RA. PGRN levels in 
serum and synovial fluids in RA patients were reported higher than controls. On 
the other hand, serum levels were directly correlated with SLE disease activity 
index, suggesting an important role of PGRN as a player in the progression of 
inflammatory diseases and a therapeutical approach for the recovery. This review 
has some limitations due to the small number of studies in this regard; 
therefore, we highlight the importance and the necessity of further 
investigation. No external funding was implicated in this systematical review."
995,"Craniofrontonasal syndrome (CFNS), also known as craniofrontonasal dysplasia, is 
an X-linked inherited developmental malformation caused by mutations in the 
ephrin B1 (EFNB1) gene. The main phenotypic features of the syndrome are coronal 
synostosis, hypertelorism, bifid nasal tip, dry and curly hair, and longitudinal 
splitting of nails. A 9-year-and-11-month-old girl with CFNS was admitted due to 
polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, and abdominal pain. On physical examination, she 
had the classical phenotypical features of CFNS. Genetic tests revealed a 
c.429_430insT (p.Gly144TrpfsTer31) heterozygote variant in the EFNB1 coding 
region. The patient was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 
autoimmune thyroiditis based on laboratory findings and symptoms. The mother of 
the patient, who had the same CFNS phenotype and EFNB1 variant, was screened for 
autoimmune diseases and was also with autoimmune thyroiditis. This is the first 
report describing the association of CFNS with T1DM and autoimmune thyroiditis 
in patients with EFNB1 mutation."
996,"The present study aimed to determine the mechanisms responsible for 
calcium-mediated smooth muscle contractions in C. melo seeds. The phytochemicals 
of C. melo were identified and quantified with the aid of Liquid Chromatography 
Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometric (LC/ESI-MS/MS) and 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and then tested in-vitro and in 
vivo to confirm involvement in smooth muscle relaxation. Allergic asthma gene 
datasets were acquired from the NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO) and 
differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis, weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis (WGCNA), and functional enrichment analysis were conducted. 
Additionally, molecular docking of key genes was carried out. Kaempferol, rutin, 
and quercetin are identified as phytochemical constituents of C. melo seeds. 
Results indicated that C. melo seeds exhibit a dose-dependent relaxant effect 
for potassium chloride (80 mM)- induced spastic contraction and calcium 
antagonistic response in calcium dose-response curves. The functional enrichment 
of WGCNA and DEG asthma-associated pathogenic genes showed cytokine-mediated 
pathways and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, CACNA1A, IL2RB, and NOS2 were 
identified as key genes with greater binding affinity with rutin, quercitrin, 
and kaempferol in molecular docking. These results show that the bronchodilator 
and antidiarrheal effects of C. melo were produced by altering the regulatory 
genes of calcium-mediated smooth muscle contraction."
997,"Toosendanin (TSN) is a triterpenoid from the fruit or bark of Melia toosendan 
Sieb et Zucc, which has clear antitumor and insecticidal activities, but it 
possesses limiting hepatotoxicity in clinical application. Autophagy is a 
degradation and recycling mechanism to maintain cellular homeostasis, and it 
also plays an essential role in TSN-induced hepatotoxicity. Nevertheless, the 
specific mechanism of TSN on autophagy-related hepatotoxicity is still unknown. 
The hepatotoxicity of TSN in vivo and in vitro was explored in this study. It 
was found that TSN induced the upregulation of the autophagy-marker 
microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B) and P62, the 
accumulation of autolysosomes, and the inhibition of autophagic flux. The middle 
and late stages of autophagy were mainly studied. The data showed that TSN did 
not affect the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes but significantly 
inhibited the acidity, the degradation capacity of lysosomes, and the expression 
of hydrolase cathepsin B (CTSB). The activation of autophagy could alleviate 
TSN-induced hepatocyte damage. TSN inhibited the expression of transcription 
factor EB (TFEB), which is a key transcription factor for many genes of 
autophagy and lysosomes, such as CTSB, and overexpression of TFEB alleviated the 
autophagic flux blockade caused by TSN. In summary, TSN caused hepatotoxicity by 
inhibiting TFEB-lysosome-mediated autophagic flux and activating autophagy by 
rapamycin (Rapa), which could effectively alleviate TSN-induced hepatotoxicity, 
indicating that targeting autophagy is a new strategy to intervene in the 
hepatotoxicity of TSN."
998,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most prevalent and treatment-refractory type 
of epilepsy. Among the different mechanisms associated with epileptogenesis, 
overstimulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission has been associated with the 
onset and progression of seizures in TLE. Experimental evidence indicates that 
blocking the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor or suppressing the expression 
of its subunit, mainly GluN1, may be effective in preventing epileptic seizures. 
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has received attention as a potential therapeutic 
tool due to the inhibition of gene expression in some diseases. The present work 
evaluated the potential silencing effect of intranasal administration of an 
siRNA conjugate against the GluN1 subunit in animals submitted to the 
pilocarpine model of epilepsy. The results showed that the siRNA conjugate 
transfection system silences the GluN1 subunit in the hippocampus of rats when 
administered intranasally. As demonstrated by the RT-qPCR and Western blotting 
approaches, the silencing of GluN1 was specific for this subunit without 
affecting the amount of mRNA for other subunits. Silencing increased the latency 
time for the first tonic-clonic seizure when compared to controls. The 
overlapping of findings and the validation of the intranasal route as a 
pharmacological route of siRNA targeting the GluN1 subunit give the work a 
significant biotechnological interest."
999,"NeuroAid II, a folk Chinese Medicine, is currently used in Asia for the 
treatment of stroke. An experimental study demonstrated that NeuroAid enables 
neuronal cells to be more resistant to glutamate toxicity. This research was 
constructed to evaluate the efficacy of NeuroAid in the prevention of epilepsy 
(EP). Forty healthy adult male mice were used and divided into four groups (10 
mice/group): normal control group; positive control group; NeuroAid-treated 
group (10 mg/kg); topiramate-treated group (10 mg/kg). The treatment continued 
for 7 days, and on the last day, EP was induced using strychnine at a dose of 2 
mg/kg via intraperitoneal (ip) administration. Seizure severity, latency to the 
seizure onset, the number of seizures, and the duration of each seizure episode 
were observed for one hour. The death and protection rates over the next 
twenty-four hours were recorded. Brain specimens from surviving animals were 
extracted and examined pathologically for quantification of glutamate receptor 
(GluR) gene expression in the isolated hippocampus employing real-time PCR 
analysis. Treatment with NeuroAid resulted in a significant reduction in seizure 
severity, prolonged the onset of seizures, decreased the number and duration of 
episodes, reduced brain insult, and decreased mortality rate. Reductions in the 
gene expression of GluRs in the hippocampus with minor histopathological changes 
were observed in the NeruoAid- and topiramate-treated groups. It is concluded 
that NeuroAid has a potential antiepileptic effect (EP) with the ability to 
prevent convulsion through its effect on the glutamate receptor."
1000,"The ethanol extract (EE) prepared from the leaves of Tibouchina granulosa, and 
its fraction in ethyl acetate (fEA) were evaluated concerning their capacity to 
reduce inflammation in different experimental models. fEA was also studied 
concerning its chemical constituents. EE and fEA were assayed for their 
anti-inflammatory potential, using formalin-induced licking behavior and 
carrageenan-induced inflammation into the subcutaneous air pouch (SAP) models. 
Reduction in polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) activation was performed in freshly 
isolated PMN. Chromatographic analysis of fEA was performed by HPLC-DAD. 
Hispiduloside was isolated as the main constituent in fEA, and its quantity was 
estimated to be 39.3% in fEA. EE (30 mg/kg) significantly reduced the second 
phase of formalin-induced licking. fEA demonstrated a reduction in leukocyte 
migration into the SAP. EE and fEA drastically reduced cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, 
and IFN-γ), nitric oxide (NO) production, in vitro PMN migration induced by C5a 
and IL-8, and TNF-α and IL-1β gene expression. Taken together, our data indicate 
that either ethanol extract or its fEA fraction from leaves of T. granulosa 
present an anti-inflammatory effect, contributing to the pharmacological and 
chemical knowledge of this species and confirming the rationale behind its 
traditional use."
1001,"Japanese Ardisia is widely used as a hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory 
agent in China. However, the active ingredients in Japanese Ardisia and their 
potential mechanisms of action in the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) 
are unknown. The pharmacodynamic substance and mechanism of action of Japanese 
Ardisia in the treatment of AIH were investigated using network pharmacology and 
molecular docking technology in this study. Following that, the effects of 
Japanese Ardisia were evaluated using the concanavalin A (Con A)-induced acute 
liver injury rat model. The active ingredients and targets of Japanese Ardisia 
were searched using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology 
database, and hepatitis-related therapeutic targets were identified through 
GeneCards and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man databases. A compound-target 
network was then constructed using Cytoscape software, and enrichment analysis 
was performed using gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) databases. Molecular docking technology was used to simulate the 
docking of key targets, and the AIH rat model was used to validate the 
expression of key targets. Nineteen active chemical components and 143 key 
target genes were identified. GO enrichment analysis revealed that the treatment 
of AIH with Japanese Ardisia mainly involved DNA-binding transcription factor 
binding, RNA polymerase II-specific DNA transcription factor binding, cytokine 
receptor binding, receptor-ligand activity, ubiquitin-like protein ligase 
binding, and cytokine activity. In the KEGG enrichment analysis, 165 pathways 
were identified, including the lipid and atherosclerotic pathway, IL-17 
signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, hepatitis B pathway, and the AGE-RAGE 
signaling pathway in diabetic complications. These pathways may be the key to 
effective AIH treatment with Japanese Ardisia. Molecular docking showed that 
quercetin and kaempferol have good binding to AKT1, IL6, VEGFA, and CASP3. 
Animal experiments demonstrated that Japanese Ardisia could increase the 
expression of AKT1 and decrease the expression of CASP3 protein, as well as 
IL-6, in rat liver tissues. This study identified multiple molecular targets and 
pathways for Japanese Ardisia in the treatment of AIH. At the same time, the 
effectiveness of Japanese Ardisia in treating AIH was verified by animal 
experiments."
1002,"BACKGROUND: Acanthamoeba are amphizoic amoeba majorly responsible for causing 
Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) and Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE). 
Despite its ubiquitous nature, the frequency of infections is not high, probably 
due to the existence of non-pathogenic isolates. The whole-genome sequencing and 
an annotated genome assembly can unravel the biological functions and help in 
identifying probable genes related to pathogenicity.
METHODS: Illumina and Nanopore sequencing were performed for keratitis, 
encephalitis, and non-pathogenic environmental isolates. Hybrid assembly was 
prepared for the AK and GAE isolates, while only the Illumina reads were 
utilized for a non-pathogenic environmental isolate. Protein coding genes were 
identified using the GeneMark-ES program and BLASTx module of Diamond used for 
gene prediction. Additionally, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
annotation and cluster of orthologous group's annotation using RPS-blast against 
the CDD database was performed. The subsequent data analysis and validation will 
help identify probable pathogenic genes.
RESULTS: The genome assemblies of 9.67, 8.34, and 8.89 GBs were reported for 
GAE, AK, and non-pathogenic isolate, respectively. KEGG reported 22,946 in GAE, 
24,231 in keratitis, and 9367 genes in the environmental isolate. The COG 
annotation revealed 3232 in GAE, 3403 in keratitis, and 1314 genes in the 
non-pathogenic isolate.
CONCLUSION: The present study has attempted to generate de novo hybrid genome 
assemblies of Acanthamoeba that would help decode the genome of free-living 
amoeba and will provide genomic data for a better understanding of 
virulence-related factors."
1003,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a fatal, highly contagious disease found in wild 
and domestic carnivores. Several outbreaks have occurred in wildlife in Italy in 
recent years. This study aims to detect CDV in wildlife following the increasing 
mortality of foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the Emilia-Romagna region (northern Italy) 
observed in 2021. Sixty-seven foxes and one badger (Meles meles) were subjected 
to necropsy followed by histological examination and were analyzed with 
molecular techniques to detect the presence of CDV. Of the tested animals, 16% 
(nine foxes and one badger) were positive for CDV. Phylogenetic analysis showed 
two different lineages based on complete H gene sequences. The Europe/South 
America-1 lineage was detected in one fox from Modena, which resembled the CDV 
variant associated with a previous outbreak in northern Italy in 2018, while the 
European Wildlife lineage was detected in animals from the Rimini province. 
Amino acid analysis highlighted a Y549H mutation in all sequences collected, 
which is commonly associated with increased virulence."
1004,"Lyssavirus rabies (RABV) is an RNA virus and, therefore, is subject to mutations 
due to low RNA polymerase replication fidelity, forming a population structure 
known as a viral quasispecies, which is the core of RNA viruses' adaptive 
strategy. Under new microenvironmental conditions, the fittest populations are 
selected, and the study of this process on the molecular level can help 
determine molecular signatures related to virulence. Our aim was to survey gene 
signatures on nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes that might be involved in 
virulence modulation during the in vitro evolution of RABV lineages after serial 
passages in a neuronal cell system with or without the presence of neutralizing 
antibodies based on replicative fitness, in vivo neurotropism and protein 
structure and dynamics. The experiments revealed that amino acids at positions 
186 and 188 of the glycoprotein are virulence factors of Lyssavirus rabies, and 
site 186 specifically might allow the attachment to heparan as a secondary cell 
receptor, while polymorphism at position 333 might allow the selection of escape 
mutants under suboptimal neutralizing antibodies titers."
1005,"Recent research suggests that dysbiosis of the oral microbial community is 
associated with head and neck cancer (HNC). It remains unclear whether this 
dysbiosis causes chemo-radiotherapy (CRT)-related complications. However, to 
address this question, it is essential to determine the most representative oral 
site for microbiome sampling. In this study, our purpose was to determine the 
optimal site for oral sample collection and whether the presence of HNC is 
associated with altered oral microbiome from this site. In 21 newly diagnosed 
HNC patients and 27 healthy controls, microbiome samples were collected from 
saliva, swabs from buccal mucosa, tongue, hard palate, faucial pillars and all 
mucosal sites combined. Microbial DNA was extracted and underwent 16S rRNA 
amplicon gene sequencing. In healthy controls, analysis of observed taxonomic 
units detected differences in alpha- and beta-diversity between sampling sites. 
Saliva was found to have the highest intra-community microbial diversity and 
lowest within-subject (temporal) and between-subject variance. Feature 
intersection showed that most species were shared between all sites, with saliva 
demonstrating the most unique species as well as highest overlap with other 
sites. In HNC patients, saliva was found to have the highest diversity but 
differences between sites were not statistically significant. Across all sites, 
HNC patients had lower alpha diversity than healthy controls. Beta-diversity 
analysis showed HNC patients' microbiome to be compositionally distinct from 
healthy controls. This pattern was confirmed when the salivary microbiome was 
considered alone. HNC patients exhibited reduced diversity of the oral 
microbiome. Salivary samples demonstrate temporal stability, have the richest 
diversity and are sufficient to detect perturbation due to presence of HNC. 
Hence, they can be used as representative oral samples for microbiome studies in 
HNC patients."
1006,"Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is a billion-dollar crop in regional New South Wales 
(NSW) and Queensland, Australia. Fusarium wilt (FW) caused by 
Fusarium&amp;nbsp;oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (Fov) is an economically 
important disease. Initial disease losses of up to 90% when the disease was 
first detected resulted in fields being taken out of cotton production. The 
disease is now well-managed due to the adoption of highly resistant varieties. 
However, annual disease surveys recently revealed that the disease dynamic has 
changed in the past few seasons. With relatively mild and wet weather conditions 
during the 2021/22 growing season, FW was detected in eight surveyed valleys in 
NSW and Queensland, with the disease incidence as high as 44.5% and 98.5% in 
individual fields in early and late seasons, respectively. Fov is genetically 
distinct and evolved from local Fusarium&amp;nbsp;oxysporum strains. 
Additionally, the pathogen was reported to evolve rapidly under continuous 
cotton cropping pressure. However, our knowledge of the genetic composition of 
the prevailing population is limited. Sequences of the translation elongation 
factor alpha 1 (TEF1) revealed that 94% of Fusarium isolates recovered from 
FW-infected cotton were clustered together with known Australian Fov and 
relatively distant related to overseas Fov races. All these isolates, except for 
nine, were further confirmed positive with a specific marker based on the 
Secreted in Xylem 6 (SIX6) effector gene. Vegetative compatibility group (VCG) 
analyses of 166 arbitrarily selected isolates revealed a predominance of 
VCG01111. There was only one detection of VCG01112 in the Border Rivers valley 
where it was first described. In this study, the exotic Californian Fov race 4 
strain was not detected using a specific marker based on the unique Tfo1 
insertion in the phosphate (PHO) gene. This study indicated that the prevalence 
and abundance of Fov across NSW and Queensland in the past five seasons was 
probably independent of its genetic diversity."
1007,"The coronavirus transforms the cytoplasm of susceptible cells to support virus 
replication. It also activates autophagy-like processes, the role of which is 
not well understood. Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells using 
transmission electron microscopy and autophagy PCR array. After 6-24 h 
post-infection (hpi), the cytoplasm of infected cells only contained 
double-membrane vesicles, phagophores, and phagosomes engulfing virus particles 
and cytoplasmic debris, including damaged mitochondria. The phagosomes 
interacted with the viral nucleoprotein complex, virus particles, mitochondria, 
and lipid droplets. The phagosomes transformed into egress vacuoles, which broke 
through the plasmalemma and discharged the virus particles. The Vero E6 cells 
exhibited pronounced virus replication at 6 hpi, which stabilized at 18-24 hpi 
at a high level. The autophagy PCR array tests revealed a significant 
upregulation of 10 and downregulation of 8 autophagic gene markers out of 84. 
Altogether, these results underline the importance of autophagy-like processes 
for SARS-CoV-2 maturation and egress, and point to deviations from a canonical 
autophagy response."
1008,"Extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) may inhabit the human gut 
microbiota without causing disease. However, if they reach extra-intestinal 
sites, common cystitis to bloodstream infections may occur, putting patients at 
risk. To examine the human gut as a source of endogenous infections, we 
evaluated the E. coli clonal diversity of 18 inpatients' guts and their 
relationship with strains isolated from urinary tract infection (UTI) in the 
same hospital. Random amplified polymorphic DNA evaluated the clonal diversity, 
and the antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion. One 
isolate of each clone detected was sequenced, and their virulome and resistome 
were determined. Overall, 177 isolates were screened, among which 32 clones were 
identified (mean of two clones per patient), with ExPEC strains found in over 
75% of the inpatients' guts. Endogenous infection was confirmed in 75% of the 
cases. ST10, ST59, ST69, ST131, and ST1193 clones and critical mobile 
drug-resistance encoding genes (blaCTX-M-15, blaOXA-1, blaDHA-1, aac(6')-lb-cr, 
mcr-1.26, qnrB4, and qnrB19) were identified in the gut of inpatients. The 
genomic analysis highlighted the diversity of the fecal strains, colonization by 
lactose-negative E. coli, the high frequency of ExPEC in the gut of inpatients 
without infections, and the presence of β-lactamase producing E. coli in the gut 
of inpatients regardless of the previous antibiotics' usage. Considering that we 
found more than one ExPEC clone in the gut of several inpatients, surveillance 
of inpatients' fecal pathogens may prevent UTI caused by E. coli in the hospital 
and dissemination of risk clones."
1009,"Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) is characterized by the presence of low 
levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and undetectable HBsAg in the blood. The 
prevalence of OBI in blood donors in Asia ranges from 0.013% (China) to 10.9% 
(Laos), with no data available from Vietnam so far. We aimed to investigate the 
prevalence of OBI among Vietnamese blood donors. A total of 623 (114 women and 
509 men) HBsAg-negative blood donors were screened for anti-HBc and anti-HBs by 
ELISA assays. In addition, DNA from sera was isolated and nested PCR was 
performed for the HBV surface gene (S); a fragment of the S gene was then 
sequenced in positive samples. The results revealed that 39% (n = 242) of blood 
donors were positive for anti-HBc, and 70% (n = 434) were positive for anti-HBs, 
with 36% (n = 223) being positive for both anti-HBc and anti-HBs. In addition, 
3% of blood donors (n = 19) were positive for anti-HBc only, and 34% (n = 211) 
had only anti-HBs as serological marker. A total of 27% (n = 170) were 
seronegative for any marker. Two of the blood donors (0.3%) were OBI-positive 
and sequencing revealed that HBV sequences belonged to HBV genotype B, which is 
the predominant genotype in Vietnam."
1010,"Viruses are obligatorily intracellular pathogens. To generate progeny virus 
particles, influenza A viruses (IAVs) have to divert the cellular machinery to 
ensure sufficient translation of viral mRNAs. To this end, several strategies 
have been exploited by IAVs, such as host gene shutoff, suppression of host 
innate immune responses, and selective translation of viral mRNAs. Various IAV 
proteins are responsible for host gene shutoff, e.g., NS1, PA-X, and RdRp, 
through inhibition of cellular gene transcription, suppression of cellular RNA 
processing, degradation of cellular RNAs, and blockage of cellular mRNA export 
from the nucleus. Host shutoff should suppress the innate immune responses and 
also increase the translation of viral mRNAs indirectly due to the reduced 
competition from cellular mRNAs for cellular translational machinery. However, 
many other mechanisms are also responsible for the suppression of innate immune 
responses by IAV, such as prevention of the detection of the viral RNAs by the 
RLRs, inhibition of the activities of proteins involved in signaling events of 
interferon production, and inhibition of the activities of interferon-stimulated 
genes, mainly through viral NS1, PB1-F2, and PA-X proteins. IAV mRNAs may be 
selectively translated in favor of cellular mRNAs through interacting with viral 
and/or cellular proteins, such as NS1, PABPI, and/or IFIT2, in the 5'-UTR of 
viral mRNAs. This review briefly summarizes the strategies utilized by IAVs to 
ensure sufficient translation of viral mRNAs focusing on recent developments."
1011,"Wildlife shares grazing areas with herders in the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, 
and humans can be infected by zoonotic nematodes through direct contact with 
animals or contaminated water. In this study, fecal samples (n = 296) from wild 
carnivores were collected to explore the infection rate and molecular genetic 
characteristics of nematodes by stratified random sampling in the survey areas. 
Host species and the nematodes they carried were then identified using 16S rRNA 
and 18S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Statistical analysis, neutrality 
tests, genetic diversity analysis and Bayesian inferred trees were performed to 
complete the study. In total, 10 species of nematodes were detected in 240 feces 
from six species of carnivores identified (including dominant Vulpes ferrilata 
and Vulpes vulpes), namely Uncinaria stenocephala, Toxascaris sp., Crenosoma 
vulpis, Parapharyngodon bainae, Oesophagostomum muntiacum, Aspiculuris 
tetraptera, Mastophorus muris, Nematodirus spathiger, Muellerius capillaris, and 
Molineus patens. Among these nematodes, U. stenocephala (35.83%, 86/240) and 
Toxascaris sp. (14.58%, 35/240) were detected at higher rates than the other 
nematodes (χ2 = 516.909, p &lt; 0.05). Of 17 and 18 haplotypes were found based 
on the ITS1 gene for U. stenocephala and nad1 gene for Toxascaris sp., 
respectively. For the first time, using molecular methods, we report the 
infection of V. ferrilata by U. stenocephala, a potential zoonotic parasite, and 
suggest Toxascaris sp. may be a newly discovered nematode that lives within the 
fox intestine."
1012,"The ability of certain human pathogens to adapt to plants without losing their 
virulence toward people is a major concern today. Thus, the aim of the present 
work was the investigation of the presence of cross-over pathogenic bacteria in 
infected tomato and pepper plants. The objects of the study were 21 samples from 
seven different parts of the plants and three from tomato rhizosphere. In total, 
26 strains were isolated, identified by MALDI-TOF, and phenotypically 
characterized. The PCR amplification of the rpoB gene was applied as an approach 
for the rapid detection of cross-over pathogens in plant samples. A great 
bacterial diversity was revealed from tomato samples as nine species were 
identified (Leclercia adecarboxylata, Pseudesherichia vulneris, Enterobacter 
cancerogenus, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter bugandensis, Acinetobacter 
calcoaceticus, Pantoea agglomerans, Pantoea ananatis, and Pectobacterium 
carotovorum). Polymicrobial contaminations were observed in samples T2 (tomato 
flower) and T10 (tomato fruit). Five species were identified from pepper samples 
(P. agglomerans, L. adecarboxylata, Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, and 
Enterococcus sp.). Antibiotic resistance patterns were assigned in accordance 
with EFSA recommendations. All isolates showed varying resistance to the tested 
antibiotics. The genetic basis for the phenotypic antibiotic resistance was not 
revealed. No genes for the virulence factors were found among the population. To 
our knowledge, this is the first overall investigation of tomato and pepper 
cross-over pathogenic bacterial populations in Bulgaria."
1013,"As demonstrated by the 2015 Zika virus outbreak in the Americas, emerging and 
re-emerging arboviruses are public health threats that warrant research 
investment for the development of effective prophylactics and therapeutics. Many 
arboviral diseases are underreported, neglected, or of low prevalence, yet they 
all have the potential to cause outbreaks of local and international concern. 
Here, we show the production of virus-like particles (VLPs) using a rapid and 
efficient recombinant vaccinia virus (VACV) expression system for five tick- and 
mosquito-borne arboviruses: Powassan virus (POWV), Heartland virus (HRTV), 
severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), Bourbon virus (BRBV) 
and Mayaro virus (MAYV). We detected the expression of arbovirus genes of 
interest by Western blot and observed the expression of VLPs that resemble 
native virions under transmission electron microscopy. We were also able to 
improve the secretion of POWV VLPs by modifying the signal sequence within the 
capsid gene. This study describes the use of a rapid VACV platform for the 
production and purification of arbovirus VLPs that can be used as subunit or 
vectored vaccines, and provides insights into the selection of arbovirus genes 
for VLP formation and genetic modifications to improve VLP secretion and yield."
1014,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important pathogen associated with hospital, 
community, and livestock-acquired infections, with the ability to develop 
resistance to antibiotics. Nasal carriage by hospital inpatients is a risk for 
opportunistic infections. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns, virulence genes 
and genetic population structure of S. aureus nasal isolates, from inpatients at 
Busia County Referral Hospital (BCRH) were analyzed. A total of 263 inpatients 
were randomly sampled, from May to July 2015. The majority of inpatients (85.9%) 
were treated empirically with antimicrobials, including ceftriaxone (65.8%) and 
metronidazole (49.8%). Thirty S. aureus isolates were cultured from 29 
inpatients with a prevalence of 11% (10.3% methicillin-susceptible S. aureus 
(MSSA), 0.8% methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA)). Phenotypic and genotypic 
resistance was highest to penicillin-G (96.8%), trimethoprim (73.3%), and 
tetracycline (13.3%) with 20% of isolates classified as multidrug resistant. 
Virulence genes, Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl), toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 
(tsst-1), and sasX gene were detected in 16.7%, 23.3% and 3.3% of isolates. 
Phylogenetic analysis showed 4 predominant clonal complexes CC152, CC8, CC80, 
and CC508. This study has identified that inpatients of BCRH were carriers of S. 
aureus harbouring virulence genes and resistance to a range of antibiotics. This 
may indicate a public health risk to other patients and the community."
1015,"Triatoma melanica is a sylvatic vector species in Brazil. In We aimed to 
characterize the Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs), the parasitic 
loads, and the blood meal sources of insects collected in rocky outcrops in 
rural areas in the state of Minas Gerais. An optical microscope (OM) and 
kDNA-PCR were used to examine natural infection by T. cruzi, and positive 
samples were genotyped by conventional multilocus PCR. Quantification of the T. 
cruzi load was performed using qPCR, and the blood meal sources were identified 
by Sanger sequencing the 12S rRNA gene. A total of 141 T. melanica were 
captured. Of these, ~55% (61/111) and ~91% (63/69) were positive by OM and 
KDNA-PCR, respectively. We genotyped ~89% (56/63) of the T. cruzi-positive 
triatomines, with TcI (~55%, 31/56) being the most prevalent DTU, followed by 
TcIII (~20%, 11/56) and TcII (~7%, 4/56). Only TcI+TcIII mixed infections were 
detected in 10 (~18%) specimens. A wide range of variation in the parasitic 
loads of T. melanica was observed, with an overall median value of 104 
parasites/intestine, with females having higher T. cruzi loads than N2, N4, and 
N5. TcII showed lower parasitic loads compared to TcI and TcIII. The OM positive 
diagnosis odds ratio between T. cruzi infection when the parasite load is 107 
compared to 103 was approximately 29.1. The most frequent blood meal source was 
Kerodon rupestris (~58%), followed by Thrichomys apereoides (~18%), Wiedomys 
cerradensis (~8%), Galactis cuja (~8%) and Gallus gallus (~8%). Our findings 
characterize biological and epidemiological aspects of the sylvatic population 
of T. melanica in the study area, highlighting the need to extend surveillance 
and control to this vector."
1016,"Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) is a pathogen that causes 
host extraintestinal diseases. The ST95 E. coli lineage is one of the dominant 
ExPEC lineages in humans and poultry. In this study, we took advantage of 
extensive E. coli genomes available through public open-access databases to 
construct a detailed understanding of the phylogeny and evolution of ST95. We 
used a high variability of accessory genomes to highlight the diversity and 
dynamic traits of ST95. Isolates from diverse hosts and geographic sources were 
randomly located on the phylogenetic tree, which suggested that there is no host 
specificity for ST95. The time-scaled phylogeny showed that ST95 is an ancient 
and long-lasting lineage. The virulence genes, resistance genes, and 
pathogenicity islands (PAIs) were characterized in ST95 pan-genomes to provide 
novel insights into the pathogenicity and multidrug resistance (MDR) genotypes. 
We found that a pool of large plasmids drives virulence and MDR. Based on the 
unique genes in the ST95 pan-genome, we designed a novel multiplex PCR reaction 
to rapidly detect ST95. Overall, our study addressed a gap in the current 
understanding of ST95 ExPEC genomes, with significant implications for 
recognizing the success and spread of ST95."
1017,"Trypanosomes are a group of pathogens distributed in the continents of Africa, 
America, Asia and Europe, and they affect all vertebrates including the 
neotropical primate group. Information about the trypanosome's diversity, 
phylogeny, ecology and pathology in non-human primates (NHPs) from the 
neotropical region is scarce. The objective of the study was to identify 
Trypanosoma and Babesia molecularly in NHPs under the phylogenetic species 
concept. We extracted DNA from a total of 76 faecal samples collected between 
2019 and 2021, from a total of 11 non-human primate species of which 46 are from 
captive NHPs and 30 are free-living NHPs in the Western Amazon region of 
Ecuador. We did not detect DNA of Babesia sp. by polymerase chain reaction test 
in any of the faecal samples. However, the nested-PCR-based method revealed 
Trypanosoma parasites by ITS gene amplification in two faecal samples; one for 
the species Leontocebus lagonotus (from the captive population) and a second one 
for Cebus albifrons (from the free-ranging population). Maximum parsimony and 
likelihood methods with the Kimura2+G+I model inferred the evolutionary history 
of the two records, which showed an evolutionary relationship with the genus 
Trypanosoma. Two sequences are monophyletic with Trypanosoma. However, the 
number of sequences available in GenBank for their species identification is 
limited. The two samples present different molecular identifications and 
evolutionary origins in the tree topology. We are most likely referring to two 
different species, and two different localities of infection. We suggest that 
health management protocols should be implemented to prevent the transmission of 
blood-borne pathogens such as Trypanosoma sp. among captive populations. In 
addition, these protocols also protect the personnel of wildlife rehabilitation 
centers working in close proximity to NHPs and vice versa."
1018,"Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium and Salmonella enterica Serovar 
Enteritidis are well-known pathogens that cause foodborne diseases in humans. 
The emergence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella serovars has caused serious 
public health problems worldwide. In this study, two lysogenic phages, STP11 and 
SEP13, were isolated from a wastewater treatment plant in Jeddah, KSA. 
Transmission electron microscopic images revealed that both phages are new 
members of the genus ""Chivirus"" within the family Siphoviridae. Both STP11 and 
SEP13 had a lysis time of 90 min with burst sizes of 176 and 170 PFU/cell, 
respectively. The two phages were thermostable (0 °C ≤ temperature &lt; 70 °C) 
and pH tolerant at 3 ≤ pH &lt; 11. STP11 showed lytic activity for approximately 
42.8% (n = 6), while SEP13 showed against 35.7% (n = 5) of the tested bacterial 
strains. STP11 and STP13 have linear dsDNA genomes consisting of 58,890 bp and 
58,893 bp nucleotide sequences with G + C contents of 57% and 56.5%, 
respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the genomes of phages STP11 
and SEP13 contained 70 and 71 ORFs, respectively. No gene encoding tRNA was 
detected in their genome. Of the 70 putative ORFs of phage STP11, 27 (38.6%) 
were assigned to functional genes and 43 (61.4%) were annotated as hypothetical 
proteins. Similarly, 29 (40.8%) of the 71 putative ORFs of phage SEP13 were 
annotated as functional genes, whereas the remaining 42 (59.2%) were assigned as 
nonfunctional proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequence 
demonstrated that the isolated phages are closely related to Chi-like Salmonella 
viruses."
1019,"Rhipicephalus microplus is the only tick species known to serve as a biological 
vector of Theileria equi for horses and other equids in Brazil. The protozoan T. 
equi is one of the causal agents of equine piroplasmosis, a major threat in 
horse breeding systems. Vector competence is closely linked to the pathogens' 
ability to evade tick defense mechanisms. However, knowledge of tick immune 
response against infections by hemoparasites of the Theileria genus is scarce. 
In the present study, the expression of genes involved in immune signaling 
pathways of R. microplus adults' guts when challenged with a high or low 
parasitic load of T. equi was evaluated. This research demonstrates divergences 
in the immune gene expression pattern linked to T. equi infection in R. 
microplus since the Toll, IMD, and JNK signaling pathways were transcriptionally 
repressed in the guts of adult ticks infected with T. equi. Moreover, the 
results showed that different infectious doses of T. equi induce differential 
gene expression of key components of immune signaling cascades in R. microplus 
gut, suggesting a link between the intensity of infection and the activation of 
tick immunity response. The present study adds knowledge to elucidate the gut 
immune signaling response of R. microplus to T. equi infection. In addition, the 
generated data can serve as a basis for further investigations to develop 
strategies for controlling and preventing equine piroplasmosis."
1020,"Anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniais (ACL) and zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis 
(ZCL) caused by Leishmania tropica and Leishmania major, respectively, are 
endemic vector-borne diseases in southern Saudi Arabia. In 2021, an outbreak of 
cutaneous leishmaniasis occurred in the province of Asir. The main objective of 
our investigation was to analyze the epidemiological features of CL in southern 
Saudi Arabia. The ministry of health recorded 194 CL patients between January 
and December 2021 from the Asir province. Our findings showed that the majority 
of CL patients (87.1%) originated from the governorates of Khamis-Mushait and 
Abha. Most of the patients were males (62.3%). While CL affected all age groups, 
those under 13 years old were the most affected (38.1%). For both genders, CL 
patients were mostly Saudi citizens (90.7%) compared to non-Saudi expatriates. 
The majority of CL patients (75.2%) suffered from a single lesion, and the 
majority of lesions (61.3%) were located on the face. The seasonal prevalence of 
CL showed two peaks, a small one in July-August and a larger one in March. Of a 
total of 194 Giemsa slides samples, 188 showed positive amplification of 
Leishmania ITS1 gene. Based on PCR-RFLP and PCR-HMR, 183 patients showed 
positive amplification of L. tropica and five patients showed positive 
amplification of L. major. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a clear distinct 
separation between L. major and L. tropica sequences. Our results provided 
strong evidence of the pre-domination of L. tropica, the main etiological agent 
of ACL in Asir province. We reported for the first time the presence of L. 
major, an etiological agent of ZCL in the study areas. The co-circulation of ACL 
and ZCL highlighted the complexity of the epidemiology of CL in southern Saudi 
Arabia, and subsequently, further studies to identify competent vectors and 
reservoir hosts for the establishment of control strategies are needed."
1021,"Pineapple (Ananas comosus L. [Merr.]) accessions from the U.S. Tropical Plant 
Genetic Resources and Disease Research (TPGRDR) in Hilo, Hawaii were subjected 
to RNA-sequencing to study the occurrence of viral populations associated with 
this vegetatively propagated crop. Analysis of high-throughput sequencing data 
obtained from 24 germplasm accessions and public domain transcriptome shotgun 
assembly (TSA) data identified two novel sadwaviruses, putatively named 
""pineapple secovirus C"" (PSV-C) and ""pineapple secovirus D"" (PSV-D). They shared 
low amino acid sequence identity (from 34.8 to 41.3%) compared with their 
homologs in the Pro-pol region of the previously reported PSV-A and PSV-B. The 
complete genome (7485 bp) corresponding to a previously reported partial 
sequence of the badnavirus, pineapple bacilliform ER virus (PBERV), was 
retrieved from one of the datasets. Overall, we discovered a total of 69 viral 
sequences representing ten members within the Ampelovirus, Sadwavirus, and 
Badnavirus genera. Genetic diversity and recombination events were found in 
members of the pineapple mealybug wilt-associated virus (PMWaV) complex as well 
as PSVs. PMWaV-1, -3, and -6 presented recombination events across the quintuple 
gene block, while no recombination events were found for PMWaV-2. High 
recombination frequency of the RNA1 and RNA2 molecules from PSV-A and PSV-B were 
congruent with the diversity found by phylogenetic analyses. Here, we also 
report the development and improvement of RT-PCR diagnostic protocols for the 
specific identification and detection of viruses infecting pineapple based on 
the diverse viral populations characterized in this study. Given the high 
occurrence of recombination events, diversity, and discovery of viruses found in 
Ananas germplasm, the reported and validated RT-PCR assays represent an 
important advance for surveillance of viral infections of pineapple."
1022,"Anthracnose is a disease caused by Colletotrichum species. They are well known 
as major plant pathogens, and a black stem disease, specifically caused by 
Colletotrichum truncatum and primarily infecting sword bean (Canavalia 
gladiata), was observed in the Yunnan province, China. To aid disease management 
and to determine pathogenic characteristics, the species causing the leaf spot 
disease of hairy vetch was verified as C. truncatum. A sequence analysis of the 
ITS, ACT, GAPDH, and HIS3 genes was conducted, as well as morphological and 
cultural characteristics, to identify this Colletotrichum species, which has 
curved conidia. C. truncatum isolates from sword bean formed a distinctive group 
among Colletotrichum species, including those that infect other forage and field 
crops. Artificially inoculated sword bean seedlings showed typical symptoms of 
anthracnose, which were similar to field observations. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first report of C. truncatum causing black stem disease 
on sword beans in China."
1023,"The global demand for industrial enzymes has been increasing in recent years, 
and the search for new sources of these biological products is intense, 
especially in microorganisms. Most known viruses have limited genetic machinery 
and, thus, have been overlooked by the enzyme industry for years. However, a 
peculiar group of viruses breaks this paradigm. Giant viruses of the phylum 
Nucleocytoviricota infect protists (i.e., algae and amoebae) and have complex 
genomes, reaching up to 2.7 Mb in length and encoding hundreds of genes. 
Different giant viruses have robust metabolic machinery, especially those in the 
Phycodnaviridae and Mimiviridae families. In this review, we present some 
peculiarities of giant viruses that infect protists and discuss why they should 
be seen as an outstanding source of new enzymes. We revisited the genomes of 
representatives of different groups of giant viruses and put together 
information about their enzymatic machinery, highlighting several genes to be 
explored in biotechnology involved in carbohydrate metabolism, DNA replication, 
and RNA processing, among others. Finally, we present additional evidence based 
on structural biology using chitinase as a model to reinforce the role of giant 
viruses as a source of novel enzymes for biotechnological application."
1024,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections 
in humans. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which are the most frequent 
agents causing community as well as hospital-acquired UTIs, have become highly 
drug-resistant, thus making the treatment of these infections challenging. 
Recently, the use of bacteriophages (or 'phages') against multidrug-resistant 
(MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) microorganisms has garnered 
significant global attention. Bacterial biofilms play a vital role in the 
pathogenesis of UTIs caused by UPEC. Phages have the potential to disrupt 
bacterial biofilms using lytic enzymes such as EPS depolymerases and endolysins. 
We isolated a lytic phage (590B) from community sewage in Chandigarh, which was 
active against multiple MDR and XDR biofilm-forming UPEC strains. During 
whole-genome sequencing, the 44.3 kb long genome of phage 590B encoded 75 ORFs, 
of which 40 were functionally annotated based on homology with similar phage 
proteins in the database. Comparative analysis of associated phage genomes 
indicated that phage 590B evolved independently and had a distinct taxonomic 
position within the genus Kagunavirus in the subfamily Guernseyvirinae of 
Siphoviridae. The phage disrupted biofilm mass effectively when applied to 24 h 
old biofilms formed on the Foley silicon catheter and coverslip biofilm models. 
To study the effect of intact biofilm architecture on phage predation, the 
biofilms were disrupted. The phage reduced the viable cells by 0.6-1.0 order of 
magnitude after 24 h of incubation. Regrowth and intact bacterial cells were 
observed in the phage-treated planktonic culture and biofilms, respectively, 
which indicated the emergence of phage-resistant bacterial variants. The phage 
genome encoded an endolysin which might have a role in the disruption and 
inhibition of bacterial biofilms. Moreover, the genome lacked genes encoding 
toxins, virulence factors, antibiotic resistance, or lysogeny. Therefore, lytic 
phage 590B may be a good alternative to antibiotics and can be included in phage 
cocktails for the treatment of UTIs caused by biofilm-forming MDR and XDR UPEC 
strains."
1025,"The study of the interaction between temperate phages and bacteria is vital to 
understand their role in the development of human diseases. In this study, a 
novel temperate Escherichia coli phage, vB_EcoP_ZX5, with a genome size of 
39,565 bp, was isolated from human fecal samples. It has a short tail and 
belongs to the genus Uetakevirus and the family Podoviridae. Phage vB_EcoP_ZX5 
encodes three lysogeny-related proteins (ORF12, ORF21, and ORF4) and can be 
integrated into the 3'-end of guaA of its host E. coli YO1 for stable 
transmission to offspring bacteria. Phage vB_EcoP_ZX5 in lysogenized E. coli 
YO1+ was induced spontaneously, with a free phage titer of 107 PFU/mL. The 
integration of vB_EcoP_ZX5 had no significant effect on growth, biofilm, 
environmental stress response, antibiotic sensitivity, adherence to HeLa cells, 
and virulence of E. coli YO1. The ORF4 anti-repressor, ORF12 integrase, and 
ORF21 repressors that affect the lytic-lysogenic cycle of vB_EcoP_ZX5 were 
verified by protein overexpression. We could tell from changes of the number of 
total phages and the transcription level of phage genes that repressor protein 
is the key determinant of lytic-to-lysogenic conversion, and anti-repressor 
protein promotes the conversion from lysogenic cycle to lytic cycle."
1026,"African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) is the causative agent of a highly contagious 
and lethal vector-borne disease in suids. Recently, a live attenuated virus 
strain, developed using the currently circulating, virulent Georgia strain 
(ASFV-G) with a single gene deletion (ASFV-G-ΔI177L), resulted in an effective 
vaccine. Nevertheless, protective immune response mechanisms induced by this 
candidate are poorly understood. In this study, Yorkshire crossbred swine 
intramuscularly vaccinated with 106 50% hemadsorption dose (HAD50) of 
ASFV-G-ΔI177L or a vehicle control were challenged at 28 days post-inoculation 
(dpi) with 102 HAD50 of ASFV-G. Analysis of purified peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells following inoculation and challenge revealed that CD4+, CD8+ 
and CD4+CD8+ central memory T cells (CD44+CD25-CD27-CD62L+CCR7+, Tcm) decreased 
significantly by 28 dpi in ASFV-G-ΔI177L-vaccinated swine compared to baseline 
and time-matched controls. Conversely, CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD8+ effector memory T 
cells (CD44+CD25-CD27-CD62-CCR7-, Tem) increased significantly among 
ASFV-G-ΔI177L-vaccined swine by 28 dpi compared to baseline and time-matched 
controls. Additionally, the percentage of natural killer (NK), CD4+ and CD4+CD8+ 
Tem and CD8+ Tcm and Tem positive for IFNγ increased significantly following 
inoculation, surpassing that of controls by 28 dpi or earlier. These results 
suggest that NK and memory T cells play a role in protective immunity and 
suggest that studying these cell populations may be a surrogate immunity marker 
in ASF vaccination."
1027,"Different nematodes affect canines, however Acanthocheilonema reconditum was 
considered mostly a non-pathogenic parasite. Climate change, animal migration, 
and other factors transformed the dynamics of vector-borne diseases, including 
filariasis. Since 2016, a sudden increase in the number of dogs with 
microfilaremia was reported by different veterinary centers in Cali, southwest 
Colombia. The objective of this study was to molecularly identify the etiologic 
agent of this filariasis outbreak detected in this city, using PCR-RFLP and 
evaluating dogs' clinical signs. From 2018-2019, canine filariasis cases were 
prospectively evaluated after a microscopic test, recruiting 82 cases and 43 
healthy controls from 2971 samples. Acanthocheilonema reconditum (Nematoda, 
Onchocercidae) was identified in 61.3% of the cases (49/82) by PCR-RFLP. Sanger 
sequencing of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene and internal transcribed spacer-2 
fragment was additionally performed on seven cases, confirming A. reconditum in 
all of them. The filariasis cases are statistically associated with male dogs 
who have clinical signs of anemia, low levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit (p 
&lt; 0.0001), and high levels of plasma proteins (p &lt; 0.001). This emerging 
canine disease constitutes an important public health concern among 
veterinarians and active surveillance is advised to explore its zoonotic 
potential."
1028,"Mammary pathogenic E. coli (MPEC) is one of the main pathogens of environmental 
origin responsible for causing clinical mastitis worldwide. Even though E. coli 
are strongly associated with transient or persistent mastitis and the economic 
impacts of this disease, the virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of 
MPEC remain unknown. Our aim was to characterize 110 MPEC isolates obtained from 
the milk of cows with clinical mastitis, regarding the virulence factor-encoding 
genes present, adherence patterns on HeLa cells, and antimicrobial resistance 
profile. The MPEC isolates were classified mainly in phylogroups A (50.9%) and 
B1 (38.2%). None of the isolates harbored genes used for diarrheagenic E. coli 
classification, but 26 (23.6%) and 4 (3.6%) isolates produced the aggregative or 
diffuse adherence pattern, respectively. Among the 22 genes investigated, 
encoding virulence factors associated with extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli 
pathogenesis, fimH (93.6%) was the most frequent, followed by traT (77.3%) and 
ompT (68.2%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed six pulse-types 
with isolates obtained over time, thus indicating persistent intramammary 
infections. The genes encoding beta-lactamases detected were as follows: blaTEM 
(35/31.8%); blaCTX-M-2/blaCTX-M-8 (2/1.8%); blaCTX-M-15 and blaCMY-2 (1/0.9%); 
five isolates were classified as extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) 
producers. As far as we know, papA, shf, ireA, sat and blaCTX-M-8 were detected 
for the first time in MPEC. In summary, the genetic profile of the MPEC studied 
was highly heterogeneous, making it impossible to establish a common genetic 
profile useful for molecular MPEC classification. Moreover, the detection of 
ESBL-producing isolates is a serious public health concern."
1029,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici (Forl) causes crown and root rot 
disease in tomato, effecting severe economic losses. However, research on the 
pathogenicity genes and infection strategy of Forl is limited compared to that 
on F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol). In this study, we characterized FoMC69 
gene in Forl as a homolog of MC69 required for pathogenicity in rice blast 
pathogen-Magnaporthe oryzae. Gene expression analysis revealed that FoMC69 
expressionin Forl is higher than that in Folin planta. FoMC69-knockout mutant of 
Forl had significantly reduced root rot symptoms compared to the wild-type 
strain, and full pathogenicity was restored by complementation. By contrast, 
ΔFoMC69 mutant of Fol presented the same symptoms as the wild type, suggesting 
that FoMC69 of Forl, but not of Fol, was essential for full virulence in tomato 
plants. Morphological differences between the Forl and ΔFoMC69 in the roots were 
observed by fluorescent labeling using WGA-FITC. Chlamydospores of the ΔFoMC69 
mutant of Forlcontinuously increased during infection and were three times 
higher than that of the wild type at 21 days post-inoculation. These 
observations suggest that FoMC69 of Forl is required for virulence to tomato 
plants by involving the normal development and germination of chlamydospores."
1030,"BACKGROUND: L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii, the only two pathogens of 
Listeria, can survive in various environments, having different pathogenic 
characteristics. However, the genetic basis of their excellent adaptability and 
differences in pathogenicity has still not been completely elucidated.
METHODS: We performed a comparative genomic analysis based on 275 L. 
monocytogenes, 10 L. ivanovii, and 22 non-pathogenic Listeria strains.
RESULTS: Core/pan-genome analysis revealed that 975 gene families were conserved 
in all the studied strains. Additionally, 204, 242, and 756 gene families 
existed uniquely in L. monocytogenes, L. ivanovii, and both, respectively. 
Functional annotation partially verified that these unique gene families were 
closely related to their adaptability and pathogenicity. Moreover, the 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of these unique gene sets 
showed that plenty of carbohydrate transport systems and energy metabolism 
enzymes were clustered in the networks. Interestingly, 
ethanolamine-metabolic-process-related proteins were significantly enriched in 
the PPI network of the unique genes of the Listeria pathogens, which can be 
understood as a determining factor of their pathogenicity.
CONCLUSIONS: The utilization capacity of multiple carbon sources of Listeria 
pathogens, especially ethanolamine, is the key genetic basis for their ability 
to adapt to various environments and pathogenic lifestyles."
1031,"Grapevine is one of the earliest domesticated fruit crops and prized for its 
table fruits and wine worldwide. However, the concurrence of a number of 
biotic/abiotic stresses affects their yield. Stress-associated proteins (SAPs) 
play important roles in response to both biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. 
Despite the growing number of studies on the genomic organisation of SAP gene 
family in various species, little is known about this family in grapevines 
(Vitis vinifera L.). In this study, a total of 15 genes encoding proteins 
possessing A20/AN1 zinc-finger were identified based on the analysis of several 
genomic and proteomic grapevine databases. According to their structural and 
phylogenetics features, the identified SAPs were classified into three main 
groups. Results from sequence alignments, phylogenetics, genomics structure and 
conserved domains indicated that grapevine SAPs are highly and structurally 
conserved. In order to shed light on their regulatory roles in growth and 
development, as well as the responses to biotic/abiotic stresses in grapevine, 
the expression profiles of SAPs were examined in publicly available microarray 
data. Bioinformatics analysis revealed distinct temporal and spatial expression 
patterns of SAPs in various tissues, organs and developmental stages, as well as 
in response to biotic/abiotic stresses. This study provides insight into the 
evolution of SAP genes in grapevine and may aid in efforts for further 
functional identification of A20/AN1-type proteins in the signalling 
cross-talking induced by biotic/abiotic stresses."
1032,"This study focused on the detection and quantification of selected bacteria and 
on the presence of enterotoxin genes in milk and dairy products from sheep and 
goat farms in the Czech Republic using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and 
multiplex PCR (PCR). The presence of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (CP), 
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), Listeria monocytogenes, 
Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus enterotoxin genes and methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was determined in 18 milk samples, 28 fresh 
cheeses, 20 ripened cheeses and 14 yoghurts. The serological status of the herds 
in relation to CP and MAP was taken into account. The most frequently detected 
bacterium was S. aureus (48.8%), and subsequent PCR revealed 11 MRSA positive 
samples. The S. aureus enterotoxin genes seg, sei and sec were detected in two 
goat cheeses. Cheese samples showed a statistically higher risk of SA and MRSA 
occurrence. CP (8.8%) and MAP (13.8%) were detected by qPCR on two different 
seropositive farms. Cultivation of qPCR positive CP samples on agar plates 
supplemented with potassium tellurite showed the presence of viable bacterium. 
The results obtained confirmed the necessity of monitoring the infectious status 
of dairy animals and rapid diagnosis of bacterial pathogens in milk and dairy 
products."
1033,"Biofilms are mono- or multispecies microbial communities enclosed in an 
extracellular matrix (EPS). They have high potential for dissemination and are 
difficult to remove. In addition, biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant strains 
(MDRs) are even more aggravated if we consider antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as 
an important public health issue. Quorum sensing (QS) and horizontal gene 
transfer (HGT) are mechanisms that significantly contribute to the recalcitrance 
(resistance and tolerance) of biofilms, making them more robust and resistant to 
conventional sanitation methods. These mechanisms coordinate different 
strategies involved in AMR, such as activation of a quiescent state of the 
cells, moderate increase in the expression of the efflux pump, decrease in the 
membrane potential, antimicrobial inactivation, and modification of the 
antimicrobial target and the architecture of the EPS matrix itself. There are 
few studies investigating the impact of the use of inhibitors on the mechanisms 
of recalcitrance and its impact on the microbiome. Therefore, more studies to 
elucidate the effect and applications of these methods in the food production 
chain and the possible combination with antimicrobials to establish new 
strategies to control MDR biofilms are needed."
1034,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a pathogen to cause devastating and 
economically significant diseases in domestic and feral swine. ASFV mainly 
infects macrophages and monocytes and regulates its replication process by 
affecting the content of cytokines in the infected cells. There is a limited 
understanding of host gene expression and differential profiles before and after 
ASFV infection in susceptible cells. In this study, RNA-seq technology was used 
to analyze the transcriptomic change in PAMs infected with ASFV at different 
time points (0 h, 12 h, 24 h). As a result, a total of 2748, 1570, and 560 genes 
were enriched in group V12 h vs. MOCK, V24 h vs. MOCK, and V24 h vs. V12 h, 
respectively. These DEGs (differentially expressed genes) in each group were 
mainly concentrated in the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) 
pathways related to innate immunization and inflammation, including the NF-κB 
signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, 
IL-17 signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and chemokine 
signaling pathway. Furthermore, the increased levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, IKKβ, 
CXCL2, and TRAF2 and decreased level of IκBα were validated through the qPCR 
method. These results suggested that ASFV infection can activate the NF-κB 
signaling pathway in the early stage. In general, this study provides a 
theoretical basis for further understanding the pathogenesis and immune escape 
mechanism of ASFV."
1035,"Staphylococcus hominis is a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) commensal 
capable of causing serious systemic infections in humans. The emergence of 
multidrug-resistant S. hominis strains is of concern but little is known about 
the characteristics of this organism, particularly from Malaysia. Here, we 
present the comparative genome analysis of S. hominis ShoR14, a 
multidrug-resistant, methicillin-resistant blood isolate from Terengganu, 
Malaysia. Genomic DNA of S. hominis ShoR14 was sequenced on the Illumina 
platform and assembled using Unicycler v0.4.8. ShoR14 belonged to sequence type 
(ST) 1 which is the most prevalent ST of the S. hominis subsp. hominis. 
Comparative genomic analysis with closely related strains in the database with 
complete genome sequences, led to the discovery of a novel variant of the 
staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (SCCmec) type VIII element harboring the 
mecA methicillin-resistance gene in ShoR14 and its possible carriage of a SCCfus 
element that encodes the fusidic acid resistance gene (fusC). Up to seven 
possible ShoR14 plasmid contigs were identified, three of which harbored 
resistance genes for tetracycline (tetK), chloramphenicol (catA7), macrolides, 
lincosamides, and streptogramin B (ermC). Additionally, we report the discovery 
of a novel mercury-resistant transposon, Tn7456, other genomic islands, and 
prophages which make up the S. hominis mobilome."
1036,"Bovine mastitis is a common disease worldwide, and staphylococci are one of the 
most important etiological factors of this disease. Staphylococcus aureus show 
adaptability to new conditions, by which monitoring their virulence and 
antibiotic resistance mechanisms is extremely important, as it can lead to the 
development of new therapies and prevention programs. In this study, we analyzed 
Staphylococcus aureus (n = 28) obtained from dairy cattle with subclinical 
mastitis in Poland. The sensitivity of the isolated strains to antibiotics were 
confirmed by the disc diffusion method. Additionally, minimum inhibitory 
concentration values were determined for vancomycin, cefoxitin and oxacillin. 
Genotyping was performed by two methods: PCR melting profile and MLVF-PCR 
(multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat fingerprinting). Furthermore, the 
presence of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes were checked using PCR 
reactions. The analyzed strains showed the greatest resistance to penicillin 
(57%), oxytetracycline (25%) and tetracycline (18%). Among the analyzed 
staphylococci, the presence of 9 of 15 selected virulence-related genes was 
confirmed, of which the icaD, clfB and sea genes were confirmed in all 
staphylococci. Biofilm was observed in the great majority of the analyzed 
bacteria (at least 70%). In the case of genotyping among the analyzed 
staphylococci (combined analysis of results from two methods), 14 patterns were 
distinguished, of which type 2 was the dominant one (n = 10). This study 
provides new data that highlights the importance of the dominance of biofilm 
over antibiotic resistance among the analyzed strains."
1037,"Filoviruses are a group of single-stranded negative sense RNA viruses. The most 
well-known filoviruses that affect humans are ebolaviruses and marburgviruses. 
During infection, they can cause life-threatening symptoms such as inflammation, 
tissue damage, and hemorrhagic fever, with case fatality rates as high as 90%. 
The innate immune system is the first line of defense against pathogenic insults 
such as filoviruses. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like 
receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene-I-like receptors, C-type lectin 
receptors, AIM2-like receptors, and NOD-like receptors, detect pathogens and 
activate downstream signaling to induce the production of proinflammatory 
cytokines and interferons, alert the surrounding cells to the threat, and clear 
infected and damaged cells through innate immune cell death. However, 
filoviruses can modulate the host inflammatory response and innate immune cell 
death, causing an aberrant immune reaction. Here, we discuss how the innate 
immune system senses invading filoviruses and how these deadly pathogens 
interfere with the immune response. Furthermore, we highlight the experimental 
difficulties of studying filoviruses as well as the current state of 
filovirus-targeting therapeutics."
1038,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is considered an opportunistic pathogen frequently 
involved with healthcare-associated infections. The genome of K. pneumoniae is 
versatile, harbors diverse virulence factors and easily acquires and exchanges 
resistance plasmids, facilitating the emergence of new threatening clones. In 
the last years, ST16 has been described as an emergent, clinically relevant 
strain, increasingly associated with outbreaks, and carrying virulence factors 
(such as ICEKp, iuc, rmpADC/2) and a diversity of resistance genes. However, a 
far-reaching phylogenetic study of ST16, including geographically, clinically 
and temporally distributed isolates is not available. In this work, we analyzed 
all publicly available ST16 K. pneumoniae genomes in terms of virulence factors, 
including capsular lipopolysaccharide and polysaccharide diversity, plasmids and 
antimicrobial resistance genes. A core genome SNP analysis shows that less than 
1% of studied sites were variant sites, with a median pairwise single nucleotide 
polymorphism difference of 87 SNPs. The number and diversity of antimicrobial 
resistance genes, but not of virulence-related genes, increased consistently in 
ST16 strains during the studied period. A genomic comparison between ST16 and 
the high-risk clone ST11 K. pneumoniae, showed great similarities in their 
capacity to acquire resistance and virulence markers, differing mostly in the 
great diversity of capsular lipopolysaccharide and polysaccharide types in ST11, 
in comparison with ST16. While virulence and antimicrobial resistance scores 
indicated that ST11 might still constitute a more difficult-to-manage strain, 
results presented here demonstrate the great potential of the ST16 clone 
becoming critical in public health."
1039,"Oocyte quality is essential for reproductive capacity, but it rapidly declines 
with age. In addition to aging, maternal nutrition is a major concern in 
maintaining oocyte quality. Gliadin, a major component of gluten, causes gluten 
toxicity, which has been reported in a variety of gluten-related disorders. The 
basis of gluten toxicity in reproduction is being understood using simple animal 
models such as Caenorhabditis elegans. In this study, we examined the effects of 
gliadin peptide (GP; amino acids 151-170) intake on oocyte quality control in C. 
elegans. We found that GP intake impaired oocyte quality through chromosomal 
aberrations and mitochondrial oxidative stress, which was suppressed by 
antioxidant treatment. The reduced oocyte quality by GP intake consequently 
increased embryonic lethality. Furthermore, the expression of oxidative 
stress-responding genes prdx-3 and gst-4 was significantly increased by GP 
intake. The increased DAF-16 activity by GP intake suggests that DAF-16 is a 
possible transactivator of these antioxidant genes. Taken together, GP intake 
reduced reproductive capacity in C. elegans by decreasing oocyte quality and 
increasing embryonic lethality through mitochondrial oxidative stress."
1040,"Salvia plebeia R. Br. (SP), grown from autumn to spring, is used as a medicinal 
herb from roots to leaves. This herb exhibits antioxidant activities and various 
physiological effect, including anti-asthma, immune-promoting, anti-obesity, and 
anti-cholesterol effects. However, the effectiveness of SP against non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the associated mechanism have not been 
elucidated. In this study, alleviation of NAFLD by SP was confirmed in a mouse 
model of hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet and in HepG2 cells 
administered free fatty acids (FFA). In the experimental model, intrahepatic 
lipid accumulation was investigated using the AdipoRedTM assay, Oil Red O 
staining, biomarker analysis, and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Furthermore, 
glucose tolerance was examined based on the fasting glucose levels and oral 
glucose tolerance. The molecular mechanisms related to hepatic steatosis were 
determined based on marker mRNA levels. Blood FFAs were found to flow into the 
liver via the action of fatty acid translocase, cluster of differentiation 36, 
and fatty acid transporter proteins 2 and 5. Salvia plebeia R. Br. water extract 
(SPW) suppressed the FFAs inflow by regulating the expression of the 
above-mentioned proteins. Notably, modulating the expression of AMP-activated 
protein kinase (AMPK) and liver X receptor, which are involved in the regulation 
of lipid metabolism, stimulated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α in 
the nucleus to induce the expression genes involved in β-oxidation and increase 
β-oxidation in the mitochondria. AMPK modulation also increased the expression 
of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, which activated lipid synthesis 
enzymes. As a consequence of these events, triglyceride synthesis was reduced 
and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes was alleviated. Overall, our findings 
suggested that SPW could ameliorate NAFLD by inhibiting hepatic steatosis 
through AMPK modulation."
1041,"Genetic components may play an important role in the regulation of nutrient and 
energy metabolism. In the presence of specific genetic variants, metabolic 
dysregulation may occur, especially in relation to the processes of digestion, 
assimilation, and the physiological utilization of nutrients supplied to the 
body, as well as the regulation of various metabolic pathways and the balance of 
metabolic changes, which may consequently affect the effectiveness of applied 
reduction diets and weight loss after training. There are many well-documented 
studies showing that the presence of certain polymorphic variants in some genes 
can be associated with specific changes in nutrient and energy metabolism, and 
consequently, with more or less desirable effects of applied caloric reduction 
and/or exercise intervention. This systematic review focused on the role of 
genes encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and their 
coactivators in nutrient and energy metabolism. The literature review prepared 
showed that there is a link between the presence of specific alleles described 
at different polymorphic points in PPAR genes and various human body 
characteristics that are crucial for the efficacy of nutritional and/or exercise 
interventions. Genetic analysis can be a valuable element that complements the 
work of a dietitian or trainer, allowing for the planning of a personalized diet 
or training that makes the best use of the innate metabolic characteristics of 
the person who is the subject of their interventions."
1042,"Mass-spectrometry-based wheat proteomics is challenging because the current 
interpretation of mass spectrometry data relies on public databases that are not 
exhaustive (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot) or contain many redundant and poor or 
un-annotated entries (UniProtKB/TrEMBL). Here, we report the development of a 
manually curated database of the metabolic proteins of Triticum aestivum 
(hexaploid wheat), named TriMet_DB (Triticum aestivum Metabolic Proteins 
DataBase). The manually curated TriMet_DB was generated in FASTA format so that 
it can be read directly by programs used to interpret the mass spectrometry 
data. Furthermore, the complete list of entries included in the TriMet_DB is 
reported in a freely available resource, which includes for each protein the 
description, the gene code, the protein family, and the allergen name (if any). 
To evaluate its performance, the TriMet_DB was used to interpret the MS data 
acquired on the metabolic protein fraction extracted from the cultivar MEC of 
Triticum aestivum. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier 
PXD037709."
1043,"Cold-brewed jasmine tea (CB-JT) is regarded to possess characteristic flavors 
and health benefits as a novel resource of functional tea beverages. To 
investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying CB-JT-mediated protective 
effects on obesity, we evaluated the serum biochemistry, histological condition, 
glucose tolerance, gene expression profile and intestinal microbial diversity in 
high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Our results demonstrate that cold-brewed jasmine 
tea can significantly attenuate HFD-induced body weight gain, abnormal serum 
lipid levels, fat deposition, hepatic injury, inflammatory processes as well as 
metabolic endotoxemia. CB-JT also modified the microbial community composition 
in HFD-fed mice and altered the balance to one closely resembled that of the 
control group. The differential abundance of core microbes in obese mice was 
reversed by CB-JT treatment, including an increment in the abundance of Blautia, 
Mucispirillum, and Bilophila as well as a decrease in the abundance of 
Alloprevotella. CB-JT was proved to regulate the mRNA expression levels of lipid 
metabolism-related genes such as Leptin, Pgc1a Il6, and Il1b in the adipose 
tissue coupled with Cyp7a1, Lxra, Srebp1c, and Atgl in the liver. These findings 
indicate that cold-brewed jasmine tea might be served as a potential functional 
tea beverage to prevent obesity and gut microbiota dysbiosis."
1044,"Hair loss remains a significant problem that is difficult to treat; therefore, 
there is a need to identify safe natural materials that can help patients with 
hair loss. We evaluated the hair anagen activation effects of limonin, which is 
abundant in immature citrus fruits. Limonin increased the proliferation of rat 
dermal papilla cells (rDPC) by changing the levels of cyclin D1 and p27, and 
increasing the number of BrdU-positive cells. Limonin increased autophagy by 
decreasing phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin levels and increasing 
the phospho-Raptor, ATG7 and LC3B. Limonin also activated the Wnt/β-catenin 
pathway by increasing phospho-β-catenin levels. XAV939, a Wnt/β-catenin 
inhibitor, inhibited these limonin-induced changes, including induced autophagy, 
BrdU-positive cells, and cell proliferation. Limonin increased the 
phosphorylated AKT levels in both two-dimensional cultured rDPC and 
three-dimensional spheroids. Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin 
inhibited limonin-induced proliferation, and disrupted other limonin-mediated 
changes, including decreased p27, increased BrdU-positive cells, induced 
autophagy, and increased ATG7 and LC3B levels. Wortmannin also inhibited 
limonin-induced cyclin D1 and LC3 expression in spheroids. Collectively, these 
results indicate that limonin can enhance anagen signaling by activating 
autophagy via targeting the Wnt/β-catenin and/or PI3K/AKT pathways in rDPC, 
highlighting a candidate nutrient for hair loss treatment."
1045,"Life's Simple 7 (LS7) is the American Heart Association's (AHA) proposal for a 
healthy lifestyle, also known as cardiovascular health (CVH) metrics. However, 
the association between CVH metrics and the severity of hepatic steatosis and 
liver fibrosis detected by transient elastography is unknown. We performed a 
cross-sectional study using the data from the 2017-2018 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycle. The controlled attenuation 
parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) were used to evaluate the 
severity of hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis and to define NAFLD, advanced 
liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis. A total of 2679 participants were included. 
Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that per 1-unit increase in the 
CVH metric, CAP and LSM decreased by 8.565 units and 0.274 units, respectively. 
In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk of NAFLD, advanced 
liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis were 7, 10, and 6 times higher in the poor CVH 
group than in the ideal CVH group. Subgroup analysis indicated that CVD patients 
and non-Hispanic whites could benefit more from ideal CVH. In conclusion, 
adherence to ideal CVH metrics, as proposed by the AHA, can significantly reduce 
the risk of hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis."
1046,"When oxidized, dietary oils generate products which have the potential to cause 
adverse effects on human health. The objective of the study was to investigate 
whether lipid oxidation products in an oxidized dietary oil can be taken up in 
intestinal cells, induce antioxidant stress responses and potentially be 
harmful. The in vitro cell model HT29 was exposed to camelina oil with different 
extents of oxidation, or only 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal (HHE) or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal 
(HNE). The cellular content of HHE increased with an increasing extent of 
oxidation of the camelina oil added to the cell's growth media, whereas HNE did 
not show a similar trend. Deuterated HHE was taken up by the HT29 cells, with 
140 µM HHE metabolized within 0.5-1 h. The low oxidation degree of the camelina 
oil increased the gene expression of antioxidant markers (GPX, ATF6, XBP1). The 
increase in the gene expression of SOD at medium oxidation levels of the oil 
might indicate different regulation mechanisms. Highly oxidized camelina oil and 
a low concentration of HHE, over time, induced SOD and catalase enzyme activity 
in HT29 cells. Oxidized camelina oil contains multiple oxidation products which 
can be responsible for the intracellular responses observed in HT29 cells, while 
HHE and HNE in combination with other oxidation products induce antioxidant 
defence responses."
1047,"The elderly proportion of the population is gradually increasing, which poses a 
great burden to society, the economy, and the medical field. Aging is a 
physiological process involving multiple organs and numerous reactions, and 
therefore it is not easily explained or defined. At present, a growing number of 
studies are focused on the mechanisms of aging and potential strategies to delay 
aging. Some clinical drugs have been demonstrated to have anti-aging effects; 
however, many still have deficits with respect to safety and long-term use. 
Polysaccharides are natural and efficient biological macromolecules that act as 
antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, and immune regulators. Not surprisingly, 
these molecules have recently gained attention for their potential use in 
anti-aging therapies. In fact, multiple polysaccharides have been found to have 
excellent anti-aging effects in different animal models including Caenorhabditis 
elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and mice. The anti-aging qualities of 
polysaccharides have been linked to several mechanisms, such as improved 
antioxidant capacity, regulation of age-related gene expression, and improved 
immune function. Here, we summarize the current findings from research related 
to anti-aging polysaccharides based on various models, with a focus on the main 
anti-aging mechanisms of oxidative damage, age-related genes and pathways, 
immune modulation, and telomere attrition. This review aims to provide a 
reference for further research on anti-aging polysaccharides."
1048,"Statin treatment is accepted to prevent adverse cardiovascular events. However, 
statin therapy has been reported to be dose-dependently associated with 
increased risk for new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Proprotein 
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is expressed in adipose tissue and is 
positively correlated with lipid metabolism. It is, however, unknown if PCSK9 
participates in adipocyte insulin resistance occurring as a result of statin 
use. Our goal was to use an in vitro adipose tissue explant approach to support 
the hypothesis that PCSK9 regulates statin-induced new-onset T2DM. Studies were 
performed using Pcsk-/- and C57Bl/6J control mice. Pcsk9-/- and control mice 
were fed a high-fat diet to affect a state of chronically altered lipid 
metabolism and increased PCSK9. Epididymal fat was excised and incubated with 
atorvastatin (1 µmol/L) in the absence and presence of insulin or geranylgeranyl 
pyrophosphate (GGPP). PCSK9 mRNA was evaluated using quantitative rtPCR. We 
further examined the effects of atorvastatin on insulin-mediated AKT signaling 
in adipose tissue explants by immunoblotting. Atorvastatin was found to 
upregulate PCSK9 gene expression in adipose tissue. The metabolic intermediate 
GGPP is required to downregulate PCSK9 expression. PCSK9 deficiency protects 
against statin-induced impairments in insulin signaling. Moreover, 
supplementation with GGPP reversed atorvastatin-induced suppression of insulin 
signaling. Furthermore, the basal and atorvastatin-stimulated release of free 
fatty acids was observed in adipose tissue from wild-type mice but not PCSK9 
deficient mice. Collectively, we describe a novel mechanism for PCSK9 expression 
in adipose tissue that could mediate statin-impaired adipose insulin resistance."
1049,"Glycyrrhizinic acid (GL) is clinically applied to treat liver injury, and the 
bioavailability of orally administered GL is closely related to the gut 
microbiota. Therefore, the dysbiosis of gut flora in liver injury could 
significantly influence GL bioavailability. Still, less is known about the 
impact of probiotic supplementation on the bio-absorption process of oral 
medication, especially under a pathological state. Herein, probiotic L. 
rhamnosus R0011 (R0011) with a high viability in the harsh gastrointestinal 
environment was selected, and the effect of R0011 on the GL bioavailability in 
rats was investigated. Four groups of rats (n = 6 per group) were included: the 
normal group (N group), the normal group supplemented with R0011 (NLGG group), 
CCl4-induced chronic liver injury model (M group), and the model group 
supplemented with R0011 (MLGG group). Our results showed that liver injury was 
successfully induced in the M and MLGG groups via an intraperitoneal injection 
of 50% (v/v) CCl4 solution. Healthy rats supplemented with R0011 could increase 
the bioavailability of GL by 1.4-fold compared with the normal group by plasma 
pharmacokinetic analysis. Moreover, the GL bioavailability of MLGG group was 
significantly increased by 4.5-fold compared with the model group. R0011 
directly improved gut microbial glucuronidase and downregulated the host 
intestinal drug transporter gene expression of multidrug resistance protein 2 
(MRP2). More critically, R0011 restored the gut microbiota composition and 
regulated the metabolic function, significantly enhancing the microbial 
tryptophan metabolic pathway compared with the pathological state, which may 
indirectly promote the bioavailability of GL. Overall, these data may provide 
possible strategies by which to address the low bioavailability of traditional 
medicine through probiotic intervention."
1050,"Staple food preference vary in populations, but evidence of its associations 
with obesity phenotypes are limited. Using baseline data (n = 105,840) of the 
Regional Ethnic Cohort Study in Northwest China, staple food preference was 
defined according to the intake frequency of rice and wheat. Overall and 
specifically abdominal fat accumulation were determined by excessive body fat 
percentage and waist circumference. Logistic regression and equal frequency 
substitution methods were used to evaluate the associations. We observed rice 
preference (consuming rice more frequently than wheat; 7.84% for men and 8.28% 
for women) was associated with a lower risk of excessive body fat (OR, 0.743; 
95%CI, 0.669-0.826) and central obesity (OR, 0.886; 95%CI, 0.807-0.971) in men; 
and with lower risk of central obesity (OR, 0.898; 95%CI, 0.836-0.964) in women, 
compared with their wheat preference counterparties. Furthermore, similar but 
stronger inverse associations were observed in participants with normal body 
mass index. Wheat-to-rice (5 times/week) reallocations were associated with a 
36.5% lower risk of normal-weight obesity in men and a 20.5% lower risk of 
normal-weight central obesity in women. Our data suggest that, compared with 
wheat, rice preference could be associated with lower odds ratios of certain 
obesity phenotypes in the Northwest Chinese population."
1051,"Dihydroquercetin (DHQ) is a natural flavonoid with multiple bioactivities, 
including hepatoprotective effects. This study aimed to investigate whether DHQ 
improved lipid dysmetabolism in the body, especially in the liver, and whether 
there is a relationship between hepatic metabolism and altered gut flora in 
high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice. HFD-induced mice were given 50 mg/kg body 
weight DHQ intragastrically for 10 weeks. The data showed that DHQ reduced body 
weight, the weight of the liver and white adipose tissue as well as serum 
leptin, LPS, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. RNA-seq results indicated that 
DHQ down-regulated lipogenesis-related genes and up-regulated fatty acid 
oxidation-related genes, including MOGAT1 and CPT1A. Furthermore, DHQ had a 
tendency to decrease hepatic cholesterol contents by reducing the mRNA levels of 
cholesterol synthesis genes such as FDPS and HMGCS1. 16S rRNA sequencing 
analysis indicated that DHQ significantly decreased the richness of Lactococcus, 
Lachnoclostridium, and Eubacterium_xylanophilum_group. Correlation analysis 
further demonstrated that these bacteria, Lactococcus and 
Eubacterium_xylanophilum_group in particular, had significantly positive 
correlation with lipid and cholesterol synthesis genes, and negative correlation 
with fatty acid oxidation genes. In conclusion, DHQ could improve hepatic lipid 
dysmetabolism potentially by improved gut microbial community, which may be used 
as an intervention strategy in hepatic metabolism diseases."
1052,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic 
liver disease, reaching epidemic proportions worldwide. Targeting the 
gut-adipose tissue-liver axis by modulating the gut microbiota can be a 
promising therapeutic approach in NAFLD. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, a potent 
lactic-acid-producing bacterium, has been shown to attenuate NAFLD. However, to 
our knowledge, the possible effect of the Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strain 
DSM20174 (L.p. DSM20174) on the gut-adipose tissue axis, diminishing 
inflammatory mediators as fuel for NAFLD progression, is still unknown. Using a 
NAFLD mouse model fed a high-fat, high-fructose (HFHF) diet for 10 weeks, we 
show that L.p DSM20174 supplementation of HFHF mice prevented weight gain, 
improved glucose and lipid homeostasis, and reduced white adipose inflammation 
and NAFLD progression. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the faecal 
microbiota suggested that treatment of HFHF-fed mice with L.p DSM20174 changed 
the diversity and altered specific bacterial taxa at the levels of family, 
genus, and species in the gut microbiota. In conclusion, the beneficial effects 
of L.p DSM20174 in preventing fatty liver progression may be related to 
modulations in the composition and potential function of gut microbiota 
associated with lower metabolic risk factors and a reduced M1-like/M2-like ratio 
of macrophages and proinflammatory cytokine expression in white adipose tissue 
and liver."
1053,"The appearance of resistant species of fungi to the existent antimycotics is 
challenging for the scientific community. One emergent technology is the 
application of nanotechnology to develop novel antifungal agents. Metal 
nanoparticles (NPs) have shown promising results as an alternative to classical 
antimycotics. This review summarizes and discusses the antifungal mechanisms of 
metal NPs, including combinations with other antimycotics, covering the period 
from 2005 to 2022. These mechanisms include but are not limited to the 
generation of toxic oxygen species and their cellular target, the effect of the 
cell wall damage and the hyphae and spores, and the mechanisms of defense 
implied by the fungal cell. Lastly, a description of the impact of NPs on the 
transcriptomic and proteomic profiles is discussed."
1054,"In general, wound healing is a highly ordered process, with distinct phases of 
inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. However, among diabetic patients, 
the progression through these phases is often impeded by increased level of 
oxidative stress and persistent inflammation. Our previous studies demonstrated 
that cerium oxide nanoparticles (CNPs) conjugated with therapeutic microRNA146a 
(miR146a) could effectively enhance wound healing by targeting the NFκB pathway, 
reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. In the present study, we consider 
the potential effects of nanomaterial surface-faceting and morphology on the 
efficacy of miRNA delivery. Compared with octahedral-CNPs and cubic-CNPs, 
rod-CNPs exhibited higher loading capacity. In addition, in comparing the 
influence of particle morphology on wound healing efficacy, several markers for 
bioactivity were evaluated and ascribed to the combined effects of the gene 
delivery and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging properties. In the 
cellular treatment study, rod-CNP-miR146a displayed the greatest miR146a 
delivery into cells. However, the reduction of IL-6 was only observed in the 
octahedral-CNP-miR146a, suggesting that the efficacy of the miRNA delivery is a 
result of the combination of various factors. Overall, our results give 
enlightenments into the relative delivery efficiency of the CNPs with different 
morphology enhancing miRNA delivery efficacy."
1055,"It has been confirmed that the plant-specific Teosinte-branched 
1/Cycloidea/Proliferating (TCP) gene family plays a pivotal role during plant 
growth and development. M. candidum is a native ornamental species and has a 
wide range of pharmacodynamic effects. However, there is still a lack of 
research on TCP's role in controlling M. candidum's development, abiotic stress 
responses and hormone metabolism. A comprehensive description of the TCP gene 
family in M. candidum is urgently needed. In this study, we used the HMMER 
search method in conjunction with the BLASTp method to identify the members of 
the TCP gene family, and a total of 35 TCP genes were identified. A domain 
analysis further confirmed that all 35 TCPs contained a TCP superfamily, a 
characteristic involved in dimerization and DNA binding that can be found in 
most genes from this gene family, suggesting that our identification was 
effective. As a result of the domain conservation analysis, the 35 TCP genes 
could be classified into two classes, TCP-P and TCP-C, based on the conservative 
regions of 55 and 59 amino acids, respectively. Gene-duplication analysis 
revealed that most TCP genes were present in duplication events that eventually 
led to TCP gene expansion in M. candidum. All the detected gene pairs had a 
Ka/Ks value of less than one, suggesting that purification selection is the most 
important factor that influences the evolution of TCP genes. Phylogenetic 
analysis of three species displayed the evolutionary relationship of TCP genes 
across different species and further confirmed our results. The real-time 
quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) results showed that McTCP2a, McTCP7a, McTCP10, 
McTCP11, McTCP12a, McTCP13, McTCP16, McTCP17, McTCP18, McTCP20 and McTCP21 may 
be involved in leaf development; McTCP4a, McTCP1, McTCP14, McTCP17, McTCP18, 
McTCP20,&amp;nbsp;McTCP22 and McTCP24 may be involved in flower development; and 
McTCP2a, McTCP3, McTCP5a, McTCP6, McTCP7a, McTCP9, McTCP11, McTCP14 and McTCP16 
may be involved in seed development. Our results dissect the TCP gene family 
across the genome of M. candidum and provide valuable information for exploring 
TCP genes to promote molecular breeding and property improvement of M. candidum 
in the future."
1056,"Diabetic nephropathy is manifested in more than 10% of people with diabetes. It 
is a common cause of kidney failure and end-stage kidney disease. Understanding 
of mechanisms underlying the initiation and development of diabetes-induced 
kidney injuries will allow for the development of more effective methods of 
prevention and treatment of the disease. Diabetic nephropathy is a wide-ranging 
complication of diabetes, and it is necessary to discuss the ""weight"" of 
pro-inflammatory pathways and molecules in the progress of renal injuries during 
the development of the disease. A large spectrum of pro-inflammatory molecules 
and pathways participate in different stages of the pathophysiological 
progression of diabetic nephropathy, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
chemokines, their receptors, adhesion molecules, and transcription factors. On 
the other hand, it is known that one of the consequences of 
hyperglycemia-induced ROS generation is the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory 
cascades, which, in turn, activate the transcription of genes encoding 
cytokines-chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix proteins. It is a 
proven fact that a variety of plant secondary metabolites, such as tannins, 
flavonoids, and other polyphenols, demonstrate significant anti-diabetic, 
redox-modulating properties and effectively modulate the inflammatory response. 
Thus, this review is discussing the possible role of plant phenols in the 
prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy."
1057,"In this study, the methanolic and infusion extracts of two species, Thymbra 
capitata and Thymus sipyleus subsp. rosulans, were tested for their chemical 
composition and biological abilities (antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory and 
anti-inflammatory effects). The extracts yielded total phenolic and flavonoid 
contents in the range of 83.43-127.52 mg GAE/g and 9.41-46.34 mg RE/g, 
respectively. HPLC analysis revealed rosmarinic acid to be a major component of 
the studied extracts (15.85-26.43%). The best ABTS radical scavenging ability 
was observed in the methanol extract of T. capitata with 379.11 mg TE/g, 
followed by in the methanol extract of T. sipylus (360.93 mg TE/g). In the 
CUPRAC assay, the highest reducing ability was also found in the methanol 
extract of T. capitata with 802.22 mg TE/g. The phosphomolybdenum ability ranged 
from 2.39 to 3.61 mmol TE/g. In terms of tyrosinase inhibitory effects, the 
tested methanol extracts (83.18-89.66 mg KAE/g) were higher than the tested 
water extracts (18.74-19.11 mg KAE/g). Regarding the BChE inhibitory effects, 
the methanol extracts were active on the enzyme while the water extracts showed 
no inhibitory effect on it. Overall, the methanolic extracts showed better 
enzyme inhibition compared to the infusion extracts. Molecular docking also 
showed the selected exhibited potential binding affinities with all enzymes, 
with a preference for cholinesterases. Additionally, the extracts were effective 
in attenuating the LPS-induced increase in COX-2 and IL-6 gene expression in 
isolated colon, thus indicating promising anti-inflammatory effects. The 
preliminary results of this study suggest that these species are good natural 
sources of antioxidants and also provide some scope as enzyme inhibitors, most 
likely due to their bioactive contents such as phenolic acids, and thus can be 
exploited for different applications related to health promotion and disease 
prevention."
1058,"In most organisms, DNA extension is highly regulated; however, most studies have 
focused on controlling the initiation of replication, and few have been done to 
control the regulation of DNA extension. In this study, we adopted a new 
strategy for azODNs to regulate DNA extension, which is based on azobenzene 
oligonucleotide chimeras regulated by substrate binding affinity, and the 
conformation of the chimera can be regulated by a light source with a light 
wavelength of 365 nm. The results showed that the primer was extended with Taq 
DNA polymerase after visible light treatment, and DNA extension could be 
effectively hindered with UV light treatment. We also verify the reversibility 
of the photoregulation of primer extension through photoswitching of dumbbell 
asODNs by alternate irradiation with UV and visible light. Our method has the 
advantages of fast and simple, green response and reversible operations, 
providing a new strategy for regulating gene replication."
1059,"Acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity is a common cause of hepatic failure, and the 
development of effective therapy is still urgently needed. Farnesoid X receptor 
(FXR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, has been identified as a 
master gene for regulating enterohepatic metabolic homeostasis and has proven to 
be a promising drug target for various liver diseases. Through high-throughput 
chemical screening, the natural product 2-oxokolavenol was identified as a novel 
and selective FXR agonist. Further investigations revealed that 2-oxokolavenol 
exerts therapeutic efficacy against APAP-induced hepatocyte damage in an 
FXR-dependent manner. Mechanistically, 2-oxokolavenol forms two hydrogen bonds 
with M265 and Y369 of human FXR to compatibly fit into the ligand binding pocket 
of FXR, which potently leads to the recruitment of multiple co-regulators and 
selectively induces the transcriptional activity of FXR. Our findings thus not 
only reveal the direct target of natural product 2-oxokolavenol, but also 
provide a promising hit compound for the design of new FXR modulators with 
potential clinical value."
1060,"A dysregulation of the cell-death mechanism contributes to poor prognosis in 
lung cancer. New potent chemotherapeutic agents targeting apoptosis-deregulating 
molecules have been discovered. In this study, 22-(4-pyridinecarbonyl) 
jorunnamycin A (22-(4'py)-JA), a synthetic derivative of 
bistetrahydroisoquinolinequinone from the Thai blue sponge, was semisynthesized 
by the Steglich esterification method, and its pharmacological mechanism in 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was elucidated by a network pharmacology 
approach. All predicted targets of 22-(4'py)-JA and genes related to NSCLC were 
retrieved from drug-target and gene databases. A total of 78 core targets were 
identified, and their associations were analyzed by STRING and Cytoscape. Gene 
ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that molecules in 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling were potential targets of 
22-(4'py)-JA in the induction of NSCLC apoptosis. In silico molecular docking 
analysis displayed a possible interaction of ERK1/2 and MEK1 with 22-(4'py)-JA. 
In vitro anticancer activity showed that 22-(4'py)-JA has strong cytotoxic and 
apoptosis-inducing effects in H460, H292 and A549 NSCLC cells. Furthermore, 
immunoblotting confirmed that 22-(4'py)-JA induced apoptotic cell death in an 
ERK/MEK/Bcl-2-dependent manner. The present study demonstrated that 22-(4'py)-JA 
exhibited a potent anticancer effect that could be further developed for 
clinical application and showed that network pharmacology approaches are a 
powerful tool to illustrate the molecular pathways of new drugs or compounds."
1061,"Approximately 30% or more of the total proteins annotated from sequenced 
bacteria genomes are annotated as hypothetical or uncharacterized proteins. 
However, elucidation on the function of these proteins is hindered by the lack 
of simple and rapid screening methods, particularly with novel or 
hard-to-transform bacteria. In this report, we employed cell-penetrating peptide 
(CPP) -peptide nucleotide acid (PNA) conjugates to elucidate the function of 
such uncharacterized proteins in vivo within the native bacterium. 
Paenibacillus, a hard-to-transform bacterial genus, was used as a model. Two 
hypothetical genes showing amino acid sequence similarity to ι-carrageenases, 
termed cgiA and cgiB, were identified from the draft genome of Paenibacillus sp. 
strain YYML68, and CPP-PNA probes targeting the mRNA of the acyl carrier protein 
gene, acpP, and the two ι-carrageenase candidate genes were synthesized. Upon 
direct incubation of CPP-PNA targeting the mRNA of the acpP gene, we 
successfully observed growth inhibition of strain YYML68 in a 
concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, both the function of the candidate 
ι-carrageenases were also inhibited using our CPP-PNA probes allowing for the 
confirmation and characterization of these hypothetical proteins. In summary, we 
believe that CPP-PNA conjugates can serve as a simple and efficient alternative 
approach to characterize proteins in the native bacterium."
1062,"To elucidate nutritional components in sweet potato cultivars for table use and 
to compare the phytochemicals of cultivars from different countries, 'Kokei No. 
14' and 'Xinxiang' were selected. The physiological parameters and metabolites 
were determined using the colorimetric method and widely targeted metabolomics, 
respectively. Transcriptomic analysis was performed to explain the mechanism 
that resulted in phytochemical differences. 'Xinxiang' showed higher flavonoid 
and carotenoid contents. Metabolomics showed five upregulated flavonoids. Two 
essential amino acids (EAAs) and one conditionally essential amino acid (CEAA) 
were upregulated, whereas four EAAs and two CEAAs were downregulated. Unlike 
lipids, in which only one of thirty-nine was upregulated, nine of twenty-seven 
differentially accumulated phenolic acids were upregulated. Three of the eleven 
different alkaloids were upregulated. Similarly, eight organic acids were 
downregulated, with two upregulated. In addition, three of the seventeen 
different saccharides and alcohols were upregulated. In 'other metabolites,' 
unlike vitamin C, 6'-O-Glucosylaucubin and pantetheine were downregulated. The 
differentially accumulated metabolites were enriched to pathways of the 
biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, ABC transporters, and tyrosine 
metabolism, whereas the differentially expressed genes were mainly concentrated 
in the metabolic pathway, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and transmembrane 
transport functions. These results will optimize the sweet potato market 
structure and enable a healthier diet for East Asian residents."
1063,"The intestinal epithelium provides an important barrier against bacterial 
endotoxin translocation, which can regulate the absorption of water and ions. 
The disruption of epithelial barrier function can result in water transport and 
tight junction damage, or further cause diarrhea. Therefore, reducing intestinal 
epithelial barrier injury plays an important role in diarrhea. Inflammatory 
response is an important cause of intestinal barrier defects. Daidzein improving 
the barrier integrity has been reported, but the effect on tight junction 
proteins and aquaporins is not well-described yet, and the underlying mechanism 
remains indistinct in the human intestinal epithelium. This study aimed to 
investigate the effects and mechanisms of daidzein on intestinal epithelial 
barrier injury induced by LPS, and a barrier injury model induced by LPS was 
established with human colorectal epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 
cells. We found that daidzein protected the integrity of Caco-2 cell monolayers, 
reversed LPS-induced downregulation of ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and AQP3 
expression, maintained intercellular junction of ZO-1, and suppressed NF-κB and 
the expression of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6). Furthermore, we found that 
daidzein suppressed the phosphorylation of the PI3K/AKT and P38 pathway-related 
proteins and the level of the related genes, and the PI3K/AKT and P38 pathway 
inhibitors increased ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and AQP3 expression. The study 
showed that daidzein could resist LPS-induced intestinal epithelial barrier 
injury, and the mechanism is related to suppressing the PI3K/AKT and P38 
pathways. Therefore, daidzein could be a candidate as a dietary supplementation 
or drug to prevent or cure diarrhea."
1064,"Sialidase preparations are applied in structural and functional studies on 
sialoglycans, in the production of sialylated therapeutic proteins and synthetic 
substrates for use in biochemical research, etc. They are obtained mainly from 
pathogenic microorganisms; therefore, the demand for apathogenic producers of 
sialidase is of exceptional importance for the safe production of this enzyme. 
Here, we report for the first time the presence of a sialidase gene and enzyme 
in the saprophytic actinomycete Oerskovia paurometabola strain O129. An 
electrophoretically pure, glycosylated enzyme with a molecular weight of 70 kDa 
was obtained after a two-step chromatographic procedure using DEAE cellulose and 
Q-sepharose. The biochemical characterization showed that the enzyme is 
extracellular, inductive, and able to cleave α(2→3,6,8) linked sialic acids with 
preference for α(2→3) bonds. The enzyme production was strongly induced by 
glycomacropeptide (GMP) from milk whey, as well as by sialic acid. Investigation 
of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the protein molecule has the 
typical six-bladed β-propeller structure and contains all features of bacterial 
sialidases, i.e., an YRIP motif, five Asp-boxes, and the conserved amino acids 
in the active site. The presence of an unusual signal peptide of 40 amino acids 
was predicted. The sialidase-producing O.&amp;nbsp;paurometabola O129 showed 
high and constant enzyme production. Together with its saprophytic nature, this 
makes it a reliable producer with high potential for industrial application."
1065,"Inorganic arsenic is a well-known environmental toxicant and carcinogen, and 
there is overwhelming evidence for an association between this metalloid 
poisoning and hepatic diseases. However, the biological mechanism involved is 
not well characterized. In the present study, we probed how inorganic arsenic 
modulates the hepatic polarization of macrophages, as well as roles of 
PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-mediated mitophagy participates in 
regulating the metalloid-mediated macrophage polarization. Our results indicate 
that acute arsenic exposure induced macrophage polarization with up-regulated 
gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (Inos) and arginase-1 (Arg1), 
monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (Mcp-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 
(Mip-2), tumor necrosis factor (Tnf)-α, interleukin (Il)-1β and Il-6, as well as 
anti-inflammatory factors Il-4 and Il-10. In parallel, we demonstrated the 
disrupted hepatic redox balance typically characterized by the up-regulation of 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and glutathione (GSH), and activation of 
PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in the livers of acute arsenic-exposed mice. In 
addition, our results demonstrate that it might be the PINK1/Parkin-mediated 
mitophagy that renders hepatic macrophage refractory to arsenic-induced 
up-regulation of the genes Inos, Mcp-1, Mip-2, Tnf-α, Il-1β, Il-6 and Il-4. In 
this regard, this is the first time the protective effects of 
PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in inorganic arsenic-induced hepatic macrophage 
polarization in vivo have been reported. These findings add novel insights into 
the arsenical immunotoxicity and provide a basis for the preve.ntive and 
therapeutic potential of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in arsenic poisoning."
1066,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fast-growing and aggressive type of brain 
cancer. Unlike normal brain cells, GBM cells exhibit epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT), which is a crucial biological process in embryonic development 
and cell metastasis, and are highly invasive. Copper reportedly plays a critical 
role in the progression of a variety of cancers, including brain, breast, and 
lung cancers. However, excessive copper is toxic to cells. D-penicillamine (DPA) 
and triethylenetetramine (TETA) are well-known copper chelators and are the 
mainstay of treatment for copper-associated diseases. Following treatment with 
copper sulfate and DPA, GBM cells showed inhibition of proliferation and 
suppression of EMT properties, including reduced expression levels of 
N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and Zeb, which are cell markers associated with EMT. In 
contrast, treatment with copper sulfate and TETA yielded the opposite effects in 
GBM. Genes, including TGF-β, are associated with an increase in copper levels, 
implying their role in EMT. To analyze the invasion and spread of GBM, we used 
zebrafish embryos xenografted with the GBM cell line U87. The invasion of GBM 
cells into zebrafish embryos was markedly inhibited by copper treatment with 
DPA. Our findings suggest that treatment with copper and DPA inhibits 
proliferation and EMT through a mechanism involving TGF-β/Smad signaling in GBM. 
Therefore, DPA, but not TETA, could be used as adjuvant therapy for GBM with 
high copper concentrations."
1067,"The well-known proto-oncogene rearrangement during transfection (RET), also 
known as ret proto-oncogene Homo sapiens (human), is a rare gene that is 
involved in the physiological development of some organ systems and can activate 
various cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer, thyroid cancer, and 
papillary thyroid cancer. In the past few years, cancers with RET alterations 
have been treated with multikinase inhibitors (MKIs). However, because of 
off-target effects, these MKIs have developed drug resistance and some 
unacceptable adverse effects. Therefore, these MKIs are limited in their 
clinical application. Thus, the novel highly potent and RET-specific inhibitors 
selpercatinib and pralsetinib have been accelerated for approval by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), and clinical trials of TPX-0046 and zetletinib are 
underway. It is well tolerated and a potential therapeutic for RET-altered 
cancers. Thus, we will focus on current state-of-the-art therapeutics with these 
novel RET inhibitors and show their efficacy and safety in therapy."
1068,"The brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients contain numerous amyloid plaques 
that are diagnostic of the disease. The plaques are primarily composed of the 
amyloidogenic peptides proteins Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are derived by the 
processing of the amyloid pre-cursor protein (APP) by two proteases called 
β-secretase and γ-secretase. Aβ42 differs from Aβ40 in having two additional 
hydrophobic amino acids, ILE and ALA, at the C-terminus. A small percentage of 
AD is autosomal dominant (ADAD) and linked either to the genes for the 
presenilins, which are part of γ-secretase, or APP. Because ADAD shares most 
pathogenic features with widespread late-onset AD, Aβ peptides have become the 
focus of AD research. Fibrils formed by the aggregation of these peptides are 
the major component of plaques and were initially targeted in AD therapy. 
However, the fact that the abundance of plaques does not correlate well with 
cognitive decline in AD patients has led investigators to examine smaller Aβ 
aggregates called oligomers. The low levels and heterogeneity of Aβ oligomers 
have made the determination of their structures difficult, but recent structure 
determinations of oligomers either formed or initiated in detergents have been 
achieved. We report here on the structures of these oligomers and suggest how 
they may be involved in AD."
1069,"Sweet tea is a popular herbal drink in southwest China, and it is usually made 
from the shoots and tender leaves of Lithocarpus litseifolius. The sweet taste 
is mainly attributed to its high concentration of dihydrochalcones. The 
distribution and biosynthesis of dihydrochaldones in sweet tea, as well as 
neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo tests, are reviewed in this paper. 
Dihydrochalones are mainly composed of phloretin and its glycosides, namely, 
trilobatin and phloridzin, and enriched in tender leaves with significant 
geographical specificity. Biosynthesis of the dihydrochalones follows part of 
the phenylpropanoid and a branch of flavonoid metabolic pathways and is 
regulated by expression of the genes, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, 
4-coumarate: coenzyme A ligase, trans-cinnamic acid-4-hydroxylase and 
hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA double bond reductase. The dihydrochalones have been proven 
to exert a significant neuroprotective effect through their regulation against 
Aβ deposition, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, inflammation 
and apoptosis."
1070,"NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S8 (NDUFS8) is an essential core 
subunit and component of the iron-sulfur (FeS) fragment of mitochondrial complex 
I directly involved in the electron transfer process and energy metabolism. 
Pathogenic variants of the NDUFS8 are relevant to infantile-onset and severe 
diseases, including Leigh syndrome, cancer, and diabetes mellitus. With over 
1000 nuclear genes potentially causing a mitochondrial disorder, the current 
diagnostic approach requires targeted molecular analysis, guided by a 
combination of clinical and biochemical features. Currently, there are only 
several studies on pathogenic variants of the NDUFS8 in Leigh syndrome, and a 
lack of literature on its precise mechanism in cancer and diabetes mellitus 
exists. Therefore, NDUFS8-related diseases should be extensively explored and 
precisely diagnosed at the molecular level with the application of 
next-generation sequencing technologies. A more distinct comprehension will be 
needed to shed light on NDUFS8 and its related diseases for further research. In 
this review, a comprehensive summary of the current knowledge about NDUFS8 
structural function, its pathogenic mutations in Leigh syndrome, as well as its 
underlying roles in cancer and diabetes mellitus is provided, offering potential 
pathogenesis, progress, and therapeutic target of different diseases. We also 
put forward some problems and solutions for the following investigations."
1071,"In orthopedic, dental, and maxillofacial fields, joint prostheses, plates, and 
screws are widely used in the treatment of problems related to bone tissue. 
However, the use of these prosthetic systems is not free from complications: the 
fibrotic encapsulation of endosseous implants often prevents optimal integration 
of the prostheses with the surrounding bone. To overcome these issues, 
biomimetic titanium implants have been developed where synthetic peptides have 
been selectively grafted on titanium surfaces via Schiff base formation. We used 
the retro-inverted sequence (DHVPX) from [351-359] human Vitronectin and its 
dimer (D2HVP). Both protease-resistant peptides showed increased human 
osteoblast adhesion and proliferation, an augmented number of focal adhesions, 
and cellular spreading with respect to the control. D2HVP-grafted samples 
significantly enhance Secreted Phosphoprotein 1, Integrin Binding Sialoprotein, 
and Vitronectin gene expression vs. control. An estimation of peptide surface 
density was determined by Two-photon microscopy analysis on a silanized glass 
model surface labeled with a fluorescent analog."
1072,"Bimetallic nanomaterials (BMNs) composed of two different metal elements have 
certain mixing patterns and geometric structures, and they often have superior 
properties than monometallic nanomaterials. Bimetallic-based nanomaterials have 
been widely investigated and extensively used in many biomedical fields 
especially cancer therapy because of their unique morphology and structure, 
special physicochemical properties, excellent biocompatibility, and synergistic 
effect. However, most reviews focused on the application of BMNs in cancer 
diagnoses (sensing, and imaging) and rarely mentioned the application of the 
treatment of cancer. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive 
perspective on the recent progress of BNMs as therapeutic agents. We first 
introduce and discuss the synthesis methods, intrinsic properties (size, 
morphology, and structure), and optical and catalytic properties relevant to 
cancer therapy. Then, we highlight the application of BMNs in cancer therapy 
(e.g., drug/gene delivery, radiotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic 
therapy, enzyme-mediated tumor therapy, and multifunctional synergistic 
therapy). Finally, we put forward insights for the forthcoming in order to make 
more comprehensive use of BMNs and improve the medical system of cancer 
treatment."
1073,"Isoprenoids are the output of the polymerization of five-carbon, branched 
isoprenic chains derived from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its isomer, 
dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP). Isoprene units are consecutively condensed 
to form longer structures such as farnesyl and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (FPP 
and GGPP, respectively), necessary for the biosynthesis of several metabolites. 
Polyprenyl transferases and synthases use polyprenyl pyrophosphates as their 
natural substrates; however, it is known that free polyprenols, such as farnesol 
(FOH), and geranylgeraniol (GGOH) can be incorporated into prenylated proteins, 
ubiquinone, cholesterol, and dolichols. Furthermore, FOH and GGOH have been 
shown to block the effects of isoprenoid biosynthesis inhibitors such as 
fosmidomycin, bisphosphonates, or statins in several organisms. This phenomenon 
is the consequence of a short pathway, which was observed for the first time 
more than 25 years ago: the polyprenol salvage pathway, which works via the 
phosphorylation of FOH and GGOH. Biochemical studies in bacteria, animals, and 
plants suggest that this pathway can be carried out by two enzymes: a polyprenol 
kinase and a polyprenyl-phosphate kinase. However, to date, only a few genes 
have been unequivocally identified to encode these enzymes in photosynthetic 
organisms. Nevertheless, pieces of evidence for the importance of this pathway 
abound in studies related to infectious diseases, cancer, dyslipidemias, and 
nutrition, and to the mitigation of the secondary effects of several drugs. 
Furthermore, nowadays it is known that both FOH and GGOH can be incorporated via 
dietary sources that produce various biological effects. This review presents, 
in a simplified but comprehensive manner, the most important data on the FOH and 
GGOH salvage pathway, stressing its biomedical importance The main objective of 
this review is to bring to light the need to discover and characterize the 
kinases associated with the isoprenoid salvage pathway in animals and pathogens."
1074,"Natural medicine has been widely used for clinical treatment and health care in 
many countries and regions. Additionally, extracting active ingredients from 
traditional Chinese medicine and other natural plants, defining their chemical 
structure and pharmacological effects, and screening potential druggable 
candidates are also uprising directions in new drug research and development. 
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a mathematical modeling 
technique that simulates the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
elimination of drugs in various tissues and organs in vivo based on 
physiological and anatomical characteristics and physicochemical properties. 
PBPK modeling in drug research and development has gradually been recognized by 
regulatory authorities in recent years, including the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. This review summarizes the general situation and shortcomings of 
the current research on the pharmacokinetics of natural medicine and introduces 
the concept and the advantages of the PBPK model in the study of 
pharmacokinetics of natural medicine. Finally, the pharmacokinetic studies of 
natural medicine using the PBPK models are summed up, followed by discussions on 
the applications of PBPK modeling to the enzyme-mediated pharmacokinetic 
changes, special populations, new drug research and development, and new 
indication adding for natural medicine. This paper aims to provide a novel 
strategy for the preclinical research and clinical use of natural medicine."
1075,"Horses are large non-ruminant herbivores and rely on microbial fermentation for 
energy, with more than half of their maintenance energy requirement coming from 
microbial fermentation occurring in their enlarged caecum and colon. To achieve 
that, the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) of horses harbors a broad range of 
various microorganisms, differing in each GIT segment, which are essential for 
efficient utilization of feed, especially to use nutrients that are not or 
little degraded by endogenous enzymes. In addition, like in other animal 
species, the GIT microbiota is in permanent interplay with the host's cells and 
is involved in a lot of functions among which inflammation, immune homeostasis, 
and energy metabolism. As for other animals and humans, the horse gut microbiome 
is sensitive to diet, especially consumption of starch, fiber, and fat. Age, 
breeds, stress during competitions, transportation, and exercise may also impact 
the microbiome. Because of its size and its complexity, the equine GIT 
microbiota is prone to perturbations caused by external or internal stressors 
that may result in digestive diseases like gastric ulcer, diarrhea, colic, or 
colitis, and that are thought to be linked with systemic diseases like 
laminitis, equine metabolic syndrome or obesity. Thus, in this review we aim at 
understanding the common core microbiome -in terms of structure and function- in 
each segment of the GIT, as well as identifying potential microbial biomarkers 
of health or disease which are crucial to anticipate putative perturbations, 
optimize global practices and develop adapted nutritional strategies and 
personalized nutrition."
1076,"The macroalgae surface allows specific bacterial communities to colonize, 
resulting in complex biological interactions. In recent years, several 
researchers have studied the diversity and function of the epiphytic bacteria 
associated with algal host, but largely these interactions remain underexplored. 
In the present study we analysed the cultivable diversity and polymer 
degradation potential of epiphytic bacteria associated with five different 
marine macroalgae (Sargassum, Ulva, Padina, Dictyota and Pterocladia sp.) 
sampled from the central west coast of India. Out of the total 360 strains 
isolated, purified and preserved, about 238 strains were identified through 16S 
rRNA gene sequence analysis and processed for polymer (cellulose, pectin, xylan 
and starch) degrading activities. Phylogeny placed the strains within the 
classes Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Alpha-proteobacteria, and Gamma-proteobacteria 
and clustered them into 45 genera, wherein Vibrio, Bacillus, Pseudoalteromonas, 
Alteromonas, Staphylococcus and Kocuria spp. were the most abundant with 20 
strains identified as potentially novel taxa within the genera Bacillus, 
Cellulosimicrobium, Gordonia, Marinomonas, Vibrio, Luteimonas and 
Pseudoalteromonas. In terms of polymer hydrolysis potential, 61.3% had xylanase 
activity, while 59.7%, 58.8%, and 52.2% had amylase, cellulase, and pectinase 
activity, respectively. Overall, 75.6% of the strains degraded more than one 
polysaccharide, 24% degraded all polymers, while nine strains (3.8%) degraded 
raw sugarcane bagasse. This study showed great potential for seaweed-associated 
bacteria in the bio-remediation of agro-waste based raw materials, which can be 
employed in the form of green technology."
1077,"The aims of the present study were to document the presence of Aggregatibacter 
actinomyctemcomitans and the emerging oral pathogen Filifactor alocis, as well 
as to identify genotypes of these bacterial species with enhanced virulence. In 
addition, these data were analyzed in relation to periodontal pocket depth (PPD) 
and the progression of PPD from the sampled periodontal sites during a two-year 
period. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 172 periodontal pockets 
of 68 Ghanaian adolescents. PPD at sampling varied from 3-14 mm and the 
progression from baseline, i.e., two years earlier up to 8 mm. The levels of A. 
actinomycetemcomitans and F. alocis were determined with quantitative PCR. The 
highly leukotoxic JP2-genotype of A. actinomycetemcomitans and the ftxA a gene 
of F. alocis, encoding a putative Repeats-in-Toxin (RTX) protein, were detected 
with conventional PCR. The prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans was 57%, and 
14% of the samples contained the JP2 genotype. F. alocis was detected in 92% of 
the samples and the ftxA gene in 52%. The levels of these bacterial species were 
significantly associated with enhanced PPD and progression, with a more 
pronounced impact in sites positive for the JP2 genotype or the ftxA gene. Taken 
together, the results indicate that the presence of both A. 
actinomycetemcomitans and F. alocis with their RTX proteins are linked to 
increased PPD and progression of disease."
1078,"Heavy metals are considered as dangerous pollutants even in relatively low 
concentrations. Biosorption is an ecofriendly technology that uses microbial 
biomasses for adsorbing heavy metals from wastewater on their surfaces based on 
physicochemical pathways. Ten agricultural wastewater samples were collected 
from different sites in Sohag Governorate, Egypt. One hundred and nineteen zinc 
and cadmium-resistant bacterial isolates were recovered from the water samples. 
Interestingly, the isolate R1 was selected as the most resistant to Zn2+ and 
Cd2+. This isolate was morphologically and biochemically characterized and 
identified by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene as Priestia megaterium, and then 
deposited in the GenBank database under the accession number PRJNA526404. 
Studying the effects of pH and contact time on the biosorption process revealed 
that the maximum biosorption was achieved within 50 min at pH 7 and 8 for Zn2+ 
and Cd2+, respectively, by the living and lyophelized biomass of Priestia 
megaterium PRJNA526404. The preliminary characterization of the main chemical 
groups present on the cell wall, which are responsible for heavy metal 
biosorption, was performed by Infrared analysis (IR). Kinetics studies revealed 
that data were fitted towards the models hypothesized by Langmuir and Freundlich 
isotherm equations. The maximum capacity values (qmax) for biosorption of zinc 
and cadmium reached by using living and lyophelized biomass were 196.08; 227.27 
and 178.57; 212.777 mg/g, respectively, and it was indicated that lyophilization 
improved efficiency of the biomass to heavy metals compared to living cells. The 
results indicated that Priestia megaterium PRJNA526404 had good application 
prospect in cadmium and zinc water remediation."
1079,"Protein P66 is one of the crucial virulence factors of Borrelia, inducing the 
production of specific antibodies in patients with ixodid tick-borne borreliosis 
(ITBB). Various species of Borrelia are characterized by genetic variability of 
the surface-exposed loop of P66. However, little is known about this variability 
in Borrelia bavariensis. Here we describe the variability of the nucleotide 
sequences of P66 gene locus in isolates of B. bavariensis. Analysis of 
nucleotide sequences of P66 in 27 isolates of B. bavariensis from ITBB patients 
revealed three allelic variants of this gene. The alignment score of amino acid 
sequences in the isolates showed amino acid replacements in various positions 
confirming the presence of three allelic variants. Two of them are 
characteristic only for some isolates of B. bavariensis of the Eurasian gene 
pool from various parts of the geographic ranges of B. bavariensis from various 
samples. At least three allelic variants of P66 B. bavariensis have been 
identified, which have different amino acid expression, occur with different 
frequency in ITBB patients and, presumably, can have different effects on the 
course of the infection."
1080,"In household washing machines, opportunistic pathogens such as Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa are present, which represent the household as a possible reservoir 
for clinical pathogens. Here, four novel P. aeruginosa strains, isolated from 
different sites of household appliances, were investigated regarding their 
biofilm formation. Only two isolates showed strong surface-adhered biofilm 
formation. In consequence of these phenotypic differences, we performed whole 
genome sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology together with Illumina MiSeq. 
Whole genome data were screened for the prevalence of 285 virulence- and 
biofilm-associated genes as well as for prophages. Linking biofilm phenotypes 
and parallelly appearing gene compositions, we assume a relevancy of the las 
quorum sensing system and the phage-encoded bacteriophage control infection gene 
bci, which was found on integrated phi297 DNA in all biofilm-forming isolates. 
Additionally, only the isolates revealing strong biofilm formation harbored the 
ϕCTX-like prophage Dobby, implicating a role of this prophage on biofilm 
formation. Investigations on clinically relevant pathogens within household 
appliances emphasize their adaptability to harsh environments, with high 
concentrations of detergents, providing greater insights into pathogenicity and 
underlying mechanisms. This in turn opens the possibility to map and 
characterize potentially relevant strains even before they appear as pathogens 
in society."
1081,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen often responsible for 
biofilm-associated infections. The high adhesion of bacterial cells onto 
biotic/abiotic surfaces is followed by production of an extracellular 
polysaccharidic matrix and formation of a sessile community (the biofilm) by the 
release of specific quorum-sensing molecules, named autoinducers (AI). When the 
concentrations of AI reach a threshold level, they induce the expression of many 
virulence genes, including those involved in biofilm formation, motility, 
pyoverdine and pyocyanin release. P. aeruginosa embedded into biofilm becomes 
resistant to both conventional drugs and the host's immune response. 
Accordingly, biofilm-associated infections are a major clinical problem 
underlining the need for new antimicrobial therapies. In this study, we 
evaluated the effects of pomegranate peel extract (PomeGr) in vitro on P. 
aeruginosa growth and biofilm formation; moreover, the release of four AI was 
assessed. The phenolic profile of PomeGr, exposed or not to bacteria, was 
determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray 
ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) analysis. We found that bacterial 
growth, biofilm production and AI release were impaired upon PomeGr treatment. 
In addition, the PomeGr phenolic content was also markedly hampered following 
incubation with bacterial cells. In particular, punicalagin, punicalin, 
pedunculagin, granatin, di-(HHDP-galloyl-hexoside) pentoside and their isomers 
were highly consumed. Overall, these results provide novel insights on the 
ability of PomeGr to attenuate P. aeruginosa virulence; moreover, the AI 
impairment and the observed consumption of specific phenolic compounds may offer 
new tools in designing innovative therapeutic approaches against bacterial 
infections."
1082,"β-Mannan is abundant in the human diet and in hemicellulose derived from 
softwood. Linear or galactose-substituted β-mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS/GMOSs) 
derived from β-mannan are considered emerging prebiotics that could stimulate 
health-associated gut microbiota. However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet 
resolved. Therefore, this study investigated the cross-feeding and metabolic 
interactions between Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15703, an acetate 
producer, and Roseburia hominis A2-183 DSMZ 16839, a butyrate producer, during 
utilization of MOS/GMOSs. Cocultivation studies suggest that both strains 
coexist due to differential MOS/GMOS utilization, along with the cross-feeding 
of acetate from B. adolescentis E194a to R. hominis A2-183. The data suggest 
that R. hominis A2-183 efficiently utilizes MOS/GMOS in mono- and cocultivation. 
Notably, we observed the transcriptional upregulation of certain genes within a 
dedicated MOS/GMOS utilization locus (RhMosUL), and an exo-oligomannosidase 
(RhMan113A) gene located distally in the R. hominis A2-183 genome. 
Significantly, biochemical analysis of β-1,4 mannan-oligosaccharide 
phosphorylase (RhMOP130A), α-galactosidase (RhGal36A), and exo-oligomannosidase 
(RhMan113A) suggested their potential synergistic role in the initial 
utilization of MOS/GMOSs. Thus, our results enhance the understanding of 
MOS/GMOS utilization by potential health-promoting human gut microbiota and 
highlight the role of cross-feeding and metabolic interactions between two 
secondary mannan degraders inhabiting the same ecological niche in the gut."
1083,"The present study aimed to evaluate the safety of Bacillus subtilis (BS) 
IDCC1101, newly isolated from Cheonggukjang in Korea. Genome sequencing of BS 
IDCC1101 was performed to investigate the presence of secondary metabolites, 
virulence, antibiotic resistance, and mobile elements. Its phenotypic safety 
analyses included antibiotic susceptibility, enzyme activity, carbohydrate 
utilization, production of biogenic amines (BAs) and D-/L-lactate, hemolytic 
activity, and toxicities in HaCaT cells and rats. The genome of BS IDCC1101 
consisted of 4,118,950 bp with 3077 functional genes. Among them, antimicrobial 
and antifungal secondary metabolites were found, such as fengycin, 
bacillibactin, and bacilysin. Antibiotic resistance and virulence genes did not 
exhibit transferability since they did not overlap with mobile elements in the 
genome. BS IDCC1101 was susceptible to almost all antibiotics suggested for 
assessment of BS's antibiotic susceptibility by EFSA guidelines, except for 
streptomycin. BS IDCC1101 showed the utilization of a wide range of 27 
carbohydrates, as well as enzyme activities such as alkaline phosphatase, 
esterase, esterase lipase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, α-galactosidase, 
β-galactosidase, α-glucosidase, and β-glucosidase activities. Additionally, BS 
IDCC1101 did not exhibit the production of D-/L-lactate and hemolytic 
activities. Its toxicity in HaCaT cells and rats was also not detected. Thus, 
these genotypic and phenotypic findings indicate that BS IDCC1101 can be safely 
used for industrial applications."
1084,"Among oral diseases, dental caries is one of the most frequent to affect human 
health. The current research work aimed to ascertain the antibacterial, 
anti-biofilm, and antioxidative potential of Piper betle leaf extract against 
bacteria isolated from dental caries. Analysis for the presence of phytochemical 
compounds revealed compounds, such as tannins, steroids, phenolic compounds, and 
alkaloids, which were also confirmed by TLC and FTIR. GC-MS analysis elucidated 
the presence of 20 phytocompounds, among which were some well-reported bioactive 
compounds. The chloroform extract of P. betle demonstrated good antibacterial 
activity (7 mm) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (100 mg mL-1) against 
Bacillus gaemokensis MW067143, which was the frequent biofilm producer among 
isolated bacterial strains. Fractions of the extract were isolated through 
column chromatography, after which the antibacterial activity was again 
evaluated. Spirost-8-en-11-one,3-hydroxy(3β,5α,14β,20β,22β,25R), an oxosteroid 
in nature, was observed to exhibit remarkable antibacterial potential (12 mm) 
against B. gaemokensis. Bacterial cells treated with P. betle extract had 
elevated SOD, APOX, POX, and GR activity, while its proteolytic activity against 
whole bacterial proteins was pronounced with the suppression of several proteins 
(50, 40, 15, and 10 kDa) in SDS-PAGE. Bacterial cells treated with P. betle 
extract demonstrated decreased growth, while the extract was also observed to 
exhibit inhibition of biofilm formation (70.11%) and demolition of established 
B. gaemokensis biofilms (57.98%). SEM analysis revealed significant changes to 
bacterial morphology post treatment with P. betle, with cellular disintegration 
being prominent. In silico network pharmacology analysis elucidated proteins 
like ESR1 and IL6 to be majorly involved in biological pathways of dental 
caries, which also interact with the protective ability of P. betle. Gene 
Ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways were also screened using enrichment 
analysis. Molecular docking demonstrated the highest binding affinity of 
Spirost-8-en-11-one,3-hydroxy-,(3β,5α,14β,20β,22β,25R) with bacterial proteins 
FabI (-12 kcal/mol), MurB (-17.1 kcal/mol), and FtsZ (-14.9 kcal/mol). 
Therefore, it is suggested that P. betle can serve a potentially therapeutic 
role and could be used in the preparation of herbal formulations for managing 
bacterial flora."
1085,"Erwinia amylovora, the causative agent of fire blight, leads to important 
economic losses of apple and pear crops worldwide. This study aimed to 
investigate the potential of the resident microbiota of the apple blossom in 
combatting plant disease-causing organisms, with a focus on controlling fire 
blight. We obtained 538 isolates from sites around Canton Zurich, which we 
tested for activity against Pectobacterium carotovorum and E. amylovora. We also 
evaluated the isolates' activity against oomycete and fungal pathogens. Nine 
isolates showed activity against P. carotovorum, and eight of these against E. 
amylovora. Furthermore, 117 showed antifungal, and 161 anti-oomycete, activity. 
We assigned genera and in some cases species to 238 of the isolates by 
sequencing their 16S RNA-encoding gene. Five strains showed activity against all 
pathogens and were tested in a detached apple model for anti-E. amylovora 
activity. Of these five strains, two were able to antagonize E. amylovora, 
namely Bacillus velezensis #124 and Pantoea agglomerans #378. We sequenced the 
P. agglomerans #378 genome and analyzed it for secondary metabolite clusters 
using antiSMASH, revealing the presence of a putative bacteriocin cluster. We 
also showed that B. velezensis #124 exhibits strong activity against three 
different fungi and two oomycetes in vitro, suggesting a broader capacity for 
biocontrol. Our results showcase the protective potential of the natural apple 
blossom microbiota. We isolated two candidate biocontrol strains from apple 
blossoms, suggesting that they might persist at the most common entry point for 
the causative agent of fire blight. Furthermore, they are probably already part 
of the human diet, suggesting they might be safe for consumption, and thus are 
promising candidates for biocontrol applications."
1086,"As a fast and reliable technology with applications in diverse biological 
studies, cell-free protein synthesis has become popular in recent decades. The 
cell-free protein synthesis system can be considered a complex chemical reaction 
system that is also open to exogenous manipulation, including that which could 
otherwise potentially harm the cell's viability. On the other hand, since the 
technology depends on the cell lysates by which genetic information is 
transformed into active proteins, the whole system resembles the cell to some 
extent. These features make cell-free protein synthesis a valuable addition to 
synthetic biology technologies, expediting the design-build-test-learn cycle of 
synthetic biology routines. While the system has traditionally been used to 
synthesize one protein product from one gene addition, recent studies have 
employed multiple gene products in order to, for example, develop novel 
bacteriophages, viral particles, or synthetic metabolisms. Thus, we would like 
to review recent advancements in applying cell-free protein synthesis technology 
to synthetic biology, with an emphasis on multiple gene expressions."
1087,"Vibrio europaeus is an emergent pathogen affecting clams, oysters and scallops 
produced in the most important countries for bivalve aquaculture. Studies 
concerning virulence factors involved in the virulence of V. europaeus are very 
scarce despite its global significance for aquaculture. Zinc-metalloproteases 
have been described as a major virulence factor in some Vibrio spp., although 
their contribution and role in the virulence of V. europaeus is not clear. To 
address this, we have studied an extracellular zinc-metalloprotease (VemA) 
encoded by V. europaeus, which was identified as a vibriolysin, highly conserved 
in this species and homologous in other pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. 
Virulence challenge experiments demonstrated that infection processes were 
faster when Manila clam larvae and juveniles were infected with the wildtype 
rather than with a mutant defective in the vemA gene (ΔvemA). V. europaeus was 
able to resist the bactericidal action of mucus and displayed a chemotaxis 
ability favoured by VemA to colonize the body mucus of clams and form a biofilm. 
The overall results suggest that VemA, although it is not a major virulence 
factor, plays a role in the colonization of the Manila clam mucus, and thus 
boosts the infection process as we observed in virulence challenge experiments."
1088,"To improve the application of endophyte Bacillus velezensis BY6 from the xylem 
of poplar, the effect of BY6 on the growth of diseased Populus davidiana × 
Populus. alba var. pyramidalis Louche (Pdpap poplar) seedlings and the 
biological control effect on the pathogen Armillaria solidipes were tested using 
a plant split-root experiment. After applying BY6 to the roots of diseased Pdpap 
poplar seedlings, the results show that plant growth indicators (dry mass, fresh 
mass, and plant height) were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05), and genes 
related to auxin hormone signal transcription were activated. BY6 indicated a 
surprising control effect after the inoculation of diseased Pdpap poplar 
seedlings. Compared to the infected control group, the treated disease index of 
the diseased Pdpap poplar seedlings in the treatment group were reduced by 
49.53% on the 20th day. The relative staining areas of diaminobenzidine (DAB) 
and Trypan blue decreased by 3.37 and 7.31 times, respectively. The 
physiological indicators (soluble sugar and protein) and oxidase indicators were 
significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). The expression levels of defense genes 
related to salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were 
significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). Amazingly, the results indicate that BY6 
simultaneously activates induced systemic resistance (ISR) and systemic acquired 
resistance (SAR) in diseased Pdpap poplar seedlings and promotes growth. The 
results indicate that BY6 is a promising candidate for developing forest tree 
biofertilizers and biopesticides."
1089,"The role of the microbiota in health and disease has long been recognized and, 
so far, the cutaneous microbiota in humans has been widely investigated. The 
research regarded mainly the microbiota variations between body districts and 
disease skin states (i.e., atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne). In fact, 
relatively little information is available about the composition of the healthy 
skin microbiota. The cosmetic industry is especially interested in developing 
products that maintain and/or improve a healthy skin microbiota. Therefore, in 
the present work, the authors chose to investigate in detail the structure and 
composition of the basal bacterial community of the face. Ninety-six cheek 
samples (48 women and 48 men) were collected in the same season and the same 
location in central northern Italy. Bacterial DNA was extracted, the 16S rDNA 
gene was amplified by PCR, the obtained amplicons were subjected to next 
generation sequencing. The principal members of the community were identified at 
the genus level, and statistical analyses showed significant variations between 
the two sexes. This study identified abundant members of the facial skin 
microbiota that were rarely reported before in the literature and demonstrated 
the differences between male and female microbiota in terms of both community 
structure and composition."
1090,"Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic airborne fungus that causes severe 
invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. Zinc is an essential 
micronutrient for the growth of A. fumigatus and even for all microorganisms. An 
increasing number of studies have reported that fungal zinc acquisition ability 
plays a key role in fungal survival in hosts with an extremely zinc-limited 
microenvironment. The ability to fight scarcity and excess of zinc are tightly 
related to fungal virulence and may be used as new potential targets. Because 
the regulation of zinc homeostasis is important, a thorough understanding of the 
functional genes involved in the regulatory network for zinc homeostasis is 
required for fungal pathogens. The current mini-review summarized potential zinc 
homeostasis regulators in A. fumigatus and classified these regulators according 
to localization and function, which were identified or predicted based on A. 
fumigatus or deduced from homologs in model yeasts. Future perspectives for zinc 
homeostasis regulators as potential antifungal targets to treat invasive 
aspergillosis are also discussed."
1091,"Marine microorganisms have evolved a large variety of metabolites and 
biochemical processes, providing great opportunities for biotechnologies. In the 
search for new hydrolytic enzymes and antimicrobial compounds with enhanced 
characteristics, the current study explored the diversity of cultured and 
uncultured marine bacteria in Black Sea water from two locations along the 
Romanian coastline. Microbial cell density in the investigated samples varied 
between 65 and 12.7 × 103 CFU·mL-1. The total bacterial community identified by 
Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene comprised 185 genera belonging to 46 
classes, mainly Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriia, and 24 
phyla. The 66 bacterial strains isolated on seawater-based culture media 
belonged to 33 genera and showed variable growth temperatures, growth rates, and 
salt tolerance. A great fraction of these strains, including Pseudoalteromonas 
and Flavobacterium species, produced extracellular proteases, lipases, and 
carbohydrases, while two strains belonging to the genera Aquimarina and 
Streptomyces exhibited antimicrobial activity against human pathogenic bacteria. 
This study led to a broader view on the diversity of microbial communities in 
the Black Sea, and provided new marine strains with hydrolytic and antimicrobial 
capabilities that may be exploited in industrial and pharmaceutical 
applications."
1092,"Fish rhabdoviruses, including Siniperca chuatsi rhabdovirus (SCRV), are epidemic 
pathogens that harm fish aquaculture. To clarify the interactions between SCRV 
and its host and explore antiviral targets, the present study performed 
transcriptome analysis in a cultured S. chuatsi skin cell line (SCSC) after SCRV 
infection at 3, 12, 24, and 36 h post-infection (hpi). Comparison with control 
obtained 38, 353, 896, and 1452 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 
detected time points, respectively. Further analysis of the Go terms and KEGG 
pathways revealed the key pathways ""Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"" and 
""interferon related pathways"" in SCSC cells responding to SCRV infection. The 
significantly up-regulated genes in the pathways were also verified by qPCR. 
Furthermore, gene cloning and overexpression revealed that five 
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) IFI4407, IFI35, Viperin, IFIT1, and IFIT5 had 
the ability to inhibit SCRV replication in FHM (Fathead minnow) cells, 
especially an inhibition efficiency more than 50% was observed in IFI35 
overexpressed cells. In summary, current study revealed the main innate immune 
pathways in S. chuatsi cells induced by SCRV infection and the major ISGs of S. 
chuatsi in controlling SCRV replication."
1093,"Bacteria communicate with each other using quorum sensing (QS) which works in an 
inducer/receptor manner. QS plays the main role in orchestrating diverse 
bacterial virulence factors. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most 
clinically important bacterial pathogens that can cause infection in almost all 
body tissues. Besides its efficient capability to develop resistance to 
different antibiotics, P. aeruginosa acquires a huge arsenal of virulence 
factors that are controlled mainly by QS. Challenging QS with FDA-approved drugs 
and natural products was proposed as a promising approach to mitigate bacterial 
virulence enabling the host immunity to complete the eradication of bacterial 
infection. The present study aims to evaluate the dipeptidase inhibitor-4 
inhibitor hypoglycemic linagliptin anti-QS and anti-virulence activities against 
P. aeruginosa in vitro, in vivo, and in silico. The current results revealed the 
significant ability to diminish the production of protease and pyocyanin, 
motility, and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, the 
histopathological examination of liver and kidney tissues of mice injected with 
linagliptin-treated bacteria showed an obvious reduction of pathogenesis. 
Linagliptin downregulation to QS-encoding genes, besides the virtual ability to 
interact with QS receptors, indicates its anti-QS activities. In conclusion, 
linagliptin is a promising anti-virulence and anti-QS candidate that can be used 
solely or in combination with traditional antimicrobial agents in the treatment 
of P. aeruginosa aggressive infections."
1094,"Colonization and infection with bacteria with acquired antibiotic resistance are 
among the risks for soldiers on international deployments. Enterobacterales with 
resistance against third-generation cephalosporines are amongst the most 
frequently imported microorganisms. To contribute to the scarcely available 
epidemiological knowledge on deployment-associated resistance migration, we 
assessed the molecular epidemiology of third-generation cephalosporine-resistant 
Escherichia coli isolated between 2007 and 2016 from German soldiers after 
deployments, with a particular focus on the African Sahel region. A total of 51 
third-generation cephalosporine-resistant E. coli isolated from 51 military 
returnees from deployment collected during the assessment period between 2007 
and 2016 were subjected to short-read next-generation sequencing analysis. 
Returnees from the Sahel region (Djibouti, Mali, South Sudan, Sudan, Sudan, and 
Uganda) comprised a proportion of 52.9% (27/51). Repeatedly isolated sequence 
types according to the Warwick University scheme from returnees from the Sahel 
region were ST38, ST131, and ST648, confirming previous epidemiological 
assessments from various sub-Saharan African regions. Locally prevalent 
resistance genes in isolates from returnees from the Sahel region associated 
with third-generation resistance were blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-27, blaCTX-M-1, 
blaTEM-169, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-99-like, blaCTX-M-125, blaSHV-12, and 
blaDHA-1, while virulence genes were east1, sat, and tsh in declining order of 
frequency of occurrence each. In line with phenotypically observed high 
resistance rates for aminoglycosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, multiple 
associated resistance genes were observed. A similar, slightly more diverse 
situation was recorded for the other deployment sites. In summary, this 
assessment provides first next-generation sequencing-based epidemiological data 
on third-generation cephalosporine-resistant E. coli imported by deployed German 
soldiers with a particular focus on deployments to the Sahel region, thus 
serving as a small sentinel. The detected sequence types are well in line with 
the results from previous epidemiological assessments in sub-Saharan Africa."
1095,"Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1 is an extremophile that grows optimally at 4.3 M 
NaCl concentration. In spite of being an established model microorganism for the 
archaea domain, direct comparisons between its proteome and transcriptome during 
osmotic stress are still not available. Through RNA-seq-based transcriptomics, 
we compared a low salt (2.6 M NaCl) stress condition with 4.3 M of NaCl and 
found 283 differentially expressed loci. The more commonly found classes of 
genes were: ABC-type transporters and transcription factors. Similarities, and 
most importantly, differences between our findings and previously published 
datasets in similar experimental conditions are discussed. We validated three 
important biological processes differentially expressed: gas vesicles production 
(due to down-regulation of gvpA1b, gvpC1b, gvpN1b, and gvpO1b); archaellum 
formation (due to down-regulation of arlI, arlB1, arlB2, and arlB3); and 
glycerol metabolism (due to up-regulation of glpA1, glpB, and glpC). Direct 
comparison between transcriptomics and proteomics showed 58% agreement between 
mRNA and protein level changes, pointing to post-transcriptional regulation 
candidates. From those genes, we highlight rpl15e, encoding for the 50S 
ribosomal protein L15e, for which we hypothesize an ionic strength-dependent 
conformational change that guides post-transcriptional processing of its mRNA 
and, thus, possible salt-dependent regulation of the translation machinery."
1096,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (ST) is a food-borne pathogen that can 
infect animals and humans. It is currently the most common bacterial pathogen 
that negatively affects the poultry industry. Although different chicken breeds 
have been observed to exhibit diverse resistance to ST infection, the underlying 
genetic mechanisms remain unclear and the genes involved in this differential 
disease resistance need to be identified. To overcome this knowledge gap, we 
used a liver transcriptome analysis to screen differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) in two different chicken breeds (local Beijing You (BY) and commercial 
Guang Ming No. 2 broiler line B (GM)) before and after ST infection. We also 
performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to detect hub 
genes, and employed selection signal analysis of candidate genes. Three 
promising genes (EGR1, JUN and FOS) were eventually identified, and were 
significantly and differentially expressed in the same breed under different 
conditions, and in the two breeds after ST infection. Hub genes, such as PPFIA4 
and ZNF395, were identified using WGCNA, and were associated with the ratio of 
heterophils to lymphocytes (H/L), an indicator of disease resistance. the 
present study identified several genes and pathways associated with resistance 
to ST infection, and found that BY had greater resistance to ST infection than 
GM. The results obtained provide valuable resources for investigating the 
mechanisms of resistance to ST infection in different chicken breeds."
1097,"There is no doubt that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat to 
public health and safety, regardless of whether it's caused by people or natural 
transmission. This study aimed to investigate the genetic characteristics and 
variations of tigecycline-resistant Gram-negative isolates from herbivores in 
northwest China. In this study, a total of 300 samples were collected from 
various provinces in northwest China, and 11 strains (3.67%) of 
tigecycline-resistant bacteria were obtained. In addition, bacterial 
identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing against 14 antibiotics were 
performed. All isolates were multiple drug-resistant (MDR) and resistant to more 
than three kinds of antibiotics. Using an Illumina MiSeq platform, 11 
tigecycline-resistant isolates were sequenced using whole genome sequencing 
(WGS). The assembled draft genomes were annotated, and then sequences were 
blasted against the AMR gene database and virulence factor database. Several 
resistance genes mediating drug resistance were detected by WGS, including 
fluoroquinolone resistance genes (gyrA_S83L, gyrA_D87N, S83L, parC_S80I, and 
gyrB_S463A), fosfomycin resistance genes (GlpT_E448K and UhpT_E350Q), 
beta-lactam resistance genes (FtsI_D350N and S357N), and the tigecycline 
resistance gene (tetR&amp;nbsp;N/A). Furthermore, there were five kinds of 
chromosomally encoded genetic systems that confer MDR (MarR_Y137H, G103S, 
MarR_N/A, SoxR_N/A, SoxS_N/A, AcrR N/A, and MexZ_K127E). A comprehensive 
analysis of MDR strains derived from WGS was used to detect variable 
antimicrobial resistance genes and their precise mechanisms of resistance. In 
addition, we found a novel ST type of Escherichia coli (ST13667) and a newly 
discovered point mutation (K127E) in the MexZ gene of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
WGS plays a crucial role in AMR control, prevention strategies, as well as 
multifaceted intervention strategies."
1098,"Exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing Lacticaseibacillus paracasei EPS DA-BACS was 
isolated from healthy human feces and its probiotic properties, as well as the 
structure and prebiotic activity of the EPS from this strain were examined. EPS 
from L. paracasei EPS DA-BACS had a ropy phenotype, which is known to have 
potential health benefits and is identified as loosely cell-bounded 
glucomannan-type EPS with a molecular size of 3.7 × 106 Da. EPS promoted the 
acid tolerance of L. paracasei EPS DA-BACS and provided cells with tolerance to 
gastrointestinal stress. The purified EPS showed growth inhibitory activity 
against Clostridium difficile. L. paracasei EPS DA-BACS cells completely 
inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 
Aspergillus brasiliensis, as well as showed high growth inhibitory activity 
against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Treatment of 
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells with heat-killed L. paracasei EPS 
DA-BACS cells led to a decrease in the production of nitric oxide, indicating 
the anti-inflammatory activity of L. paracasei EPS DA-BACS. Purified EPS 
promoted the growth of Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium bifidum, B. 
animalis, and B. faecale which showed high prebiotic activity. L. paracasei EPS 
DA-BACS harbors no antibiotic resistance genes or virulence factors. Therefore, 
L. paracasei EPS DA-BACS exhibits anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities 
with high gut adhesion ability and gastrointestinal tolerance and can be used as 
a potential probiotic."
1099,"There is an endless demand for livestock-originated food, so it is necessary to 
elucidate the hazard points for livestock breeding. Pathogens are one of the 
hazard points that threaten the biosecurity of farm-animal breeding and public 
health. As a potential foodborne pathogen, Aliarcobacter is a member of the 
intestinal microbiota of farm animals with and without diarrhea. Aliarcobacter 
spp. are capable of colonizing livestock intestines and are transmitted through 
the feces. Hence, they endanger slaughterhouses and milk products with fecal 
contamination. They also have other, rarer, vertical and horizontal transmission 
routes, including the offspring that abort in farm animals. Gastrointestinal 
symptoms and abort cases demonstrate potential financial losses to the industry. 
Viewed from this perspective, the global circulation of farm-animal products is 
a significant route for zoonotic agents, including Aliarcobacter. In the last 
decade, worldwide prevalence of Aliarcobacter in fecal samples has ranged from 
0.8% in Italy to 100% in Turkey. Furthermore, antibiotic resistance is 
recognized as a new type of environmental pollutant and has become a hot topic 
in animal breeding and the food industry. Increasing antibiotic resistance has 
become a significant problem impacting productivity. The increase in 
antimicrobial resistance rates in Aliarcobacter is caused by the misuse of 
antimicrobial drugs in livestock animals, leading to the acquiring of resistance 
genes from other bacteria, as well as mutations in current resistance genes. The 
most resistant strains are A. butzleri, A. cryaerophilus, and A. skirrowii. This 
review analyzes recent findings from the past decade on the prevalence of 
Aliarcobacter in the intestinal microbiota and the current effective antibiotics 
against Aliarcobacter. The paper also highlights that A. cryaerophilus and A. 
skirrowii are found frequently in diarrheal feces, indicating that Aliarcobacter 
should be studied further in livestock diarrheal diseases. Moreover, 
Aliarcobacter-infected farm animals can be treated with only a limited number of 
antibiotics, such as enrofloxacin, doxycycline, oxytetracycline, and gentamicin."
1100,"During sexual reproduction/conjugation of the ciliate 
Tetrahymena&amp;nbsp;thermophila, the germinal micronucleus undergoes meiosis 
resulting in four haploid micronuclei (hMICs). All hMICs undergo post-meiotic 
DNA double-strand break (PM-DSB) formation, cleaving their genome. DNA lesions 
are subsequently repaired in only one 'selected' hMIC, which eventually produces 
gametic pronuclei. DNA repair in the selected hMIC involves chromatin remodeling 
by switching from the heterochromatic to the euchromatic state of its genome. 
Here, we demonstrate that, among the 15 Tetrahymena Snf2 family proteins, a core 
of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex in Tetrahymena, the germline 
nucleus specific Iswi in Tetrahymena IswiGTt and Rad5Tt is crucial for the 
generation of gametic pronuclei. In either gene knockout, the selected hMIC 
which shows euchromatin markers such as lysine-acetylated histone H3 does not 
appear, but all hMICs in which markers for DNA lesions persist are degraded, 
indicating that both IswiGTt and Rad5Tt have important roles in repairing PM-DSB 
DNA lesions and remodeling chromatin for the euchromatic state in the selected 
hMIC."
1101,"Metagenomics offers the highest level of strain discrimination of bacterial 
pathogens from complex food and water microbiota. With the rapid evolvement of 
assembly algorithms, defining an optimal assembler based on the performance in 
the metagenomic identification of foodborne and waterborne pathogens is 
warranted. We aimed to benchmark short-read assemblers for the metagenomic 
identification of foodborne and waterborne pathogens using simulated bacterial 
communities. Bacterial communities on fresh spinach and in surface water were 
simulated by generating paired-end short reads of Illumina HiSeq, MiSeq, and 
NovaSeq at different sequencing depths. Multidrug-resistant Salmonella Indiana 
SI43 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 were included in the simulated communities 
on fresh spinach and in surface water, respectively. ABySS, IDBA-UD, MaSuRCA, 
MEGAHIT, metaSPAdes, and Ray Meta were benchmarked in terms of assembly quality, 
identifications of plasmids, virulence genes, Salmonella pathogenicity island, 
antimicrobial resistance genes, chromosomal point mutations, serotyping, 
multilocus sequence typing, and whole-genome phylogeny. Overall, MEGHIT, 
metaSPAdes, and Ray Meta were more effective for metagenomic identification. We 
did not obtain an optimal assembler when using the extracted reads classified as 
Salmonella or P. aeruginosa for downstream genomic analyses, but the extracted 
reads showed consistent phylogenetic topology with the reference genome when 
they were aligned with Salmonella or P. aeruginosa strains. In most cases, 
HiSeq, MiSeq, and NovaSeq were comparable at the same sequencing depth, while 
higher sequencing depths generally led to more accurate results. As assembly 
algorithms advance and mature, the evaluation of assemblers should be a 
continuous process."
1102,"Protozoans of the Phylum Ciliophora (ciliates) assemble many diverse 
microtubular structures in a single cell throughout the life cycle, a feature 
that made them useful models to study microtubule complexity and the role of 
tubulin isotypes. In the Antarctic ciliate Euplotes&amp;nbsp;focardii we 
identified five β-tubulin isotypes by genome sequencing, named EFBTU1, EFBTU2, 
EFBTU3, EFBTU4 and EFBTU5. By using polyclonal antibodies directed against 
EFBTU2/EFBTU1 and EFBTU3, we show that the former isotypes appear to be involved 
in the formation of all microtubular structures and are particularly abundant in 
cilia, whereas the latter specifically localizes at the bases of cilia. By RNA 
interference (RNAi) technology, we silenced the EFBTU3 gene and provided 
evidence that this isotype has a relevant role in cilia regeneration upon 
deciliation and in cell division. These results support the long-standing 
concept that tubulin isotypes possess functional specificity in building diverse 
microtubular structures."
1103,"Blue mold, caused by Penicillium spp., is an impactful postharvest disease 
resulting in significant economic losses due to reduced pome fruit quality and 
mycotoxin contamination. Using two Penicillium species with different levels of 
aggressiveness, transcriptomics were implemented in order to identify genes 
expressed during apple fruit decay and loci expressed in ungerminated conidia. 
Total RNA was isolated from ungerminated conidia and decayed apple fruit 
infected with P. expansum R19 or P. polonicum RS1. There were 2442 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the R19 and RS1 in apple. 
Comparisons within species between apple and conidia revealed 4404 DEGs for R19 
and 2935 for RS1, respectively. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed 
differential regulation in fungal transport and metabolism genes during decay, 
suggesting a flux in nutrient acquisition and detoxification strategies. In R19, 
the oxidoreductase GO category comprised 20% of all DEG groups in apple verses 
conidia. Ungerminated conidia from both species showed DEGs encoding the 
glyoxylate shunt and beta-oxidation, specifying the earliest metabolic 
requirements for germination. This is the first study to identify pre-loaded 
transcripts in conidia from blue mold fungi, reveal unique genes between species 
expressed during apple decay, and show the expression dynamics of known fungal 
virulence factors. These findings will enable development of targeted approaches 
for blue mold abatement strategies."
1104,"The harsh climatic conditions of deserts may lead to unique adaptations of 
microbes, which could serve as potential sources of new metabolites to cope with 
environmental stresses. However, the mechanisms governing the environmental 
adaptability and antimicrobial activity of desert Streptomyces remain 
inadequate, especially in extreme temperature differences, drought conditions, 
and strong radiation. Here, we isolated a Streptomyces strain from rocks in the 
Kumtagh Desert in Northwest China and tested its antibacterial activity, 
resistance to UV-C irradiation, and tolerance to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The 
whole-genome sequencing was carried out to study the mechanisms underlying 
physiological characteristics and ecological adaptation from a genomic 
perspective. This strain has a growth inhibitory effect against a variety of 
indicator bacteria, and the highest antibacterial activity recorded was against 
Bacillus cereus. Moreover, strain D23 can withstand UV-C irradiation up to 100 
J/m2 (D10 = 80 J/m2) and tolerate stress up to 70 mM H2O2. The genome prediction 
of strain D23 revealed the mechanisms associated with its adaptation to extreme 
environmental and stressful conditions. In total, 33 biosynthetic gene clusters 
(BGCs) were predicted based on anti-SMASH. Gene annotation found that S. 
huasconensis D23 contains several genes and proteins associated with the 
biosynthesis of factors required to cope with environmental stress of 
temperature, UV radiation, and osmotic pressure. The results of this study 
provide information about the genome and BGCs of the strain S. huasconensis D23. 
The experimental results combined with the genome sequencing data show that 
antimicrobial activity and stress resistance of S. huasconensis D23 was due to 
the rich and diverse secondary metabolite production capacity and the induction 
of stress-responsive genes. The environmental adaptability and antimicrobial 
activity information presented here will be valuable for subsequent work 
regarding the isolation of bioactive compounds and provide insight into the 
ecological adaptation mechanism of microbes to extreme desert environments."
1105,"A new esterase gene, est6, was discovered in an activated sludge metagenomic 
library. The 729-bp gene encodes a 242-amino acid protein (designated Est6) with 
a molecular mass of 26.1 kDa. Est6 shared only a moderate identity to a putative 
hydrolase with the highest BLASTP analysis score. Most of the closely related 
proteins are uncharacterized and are predicted from genome sequencing data of 
microorganisms or metagenomic DNA sequences. The phylogenetic analysis of Est6 
showed that the protein was assigned to family VI esterases/lipases. The 
catalytic triad of Est6 was predicted to be Ser135, Asp188, and His219, with 
Ser135 in a typically conserved pentapeptide (GFSQG) of family VI members, which 
was further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. The est6 gene was 
overexpressed successfully in its soluble form in Escherichia coli and then 
purified to its tag-free form and homogeneity by affinity chromatography. The 
purified Est6 in pH 8.0 buffer was active as a monomer. The optimal conditions 
for Est6 activity were at a temperature of 45 °C and pH of 8.0 when using 
p-nitrophenyl acetate as a substrate. The enzyme was stable over wide 
temperature and pH ranges, and it exhibited activity in the presence of organic 
solvents, metal cations, or detergents. Furthermore, the enzyme showed 
significant regioselectivity in the spectrophotometric analysis. In conclusion, 
Est6 might have the potential for applications in biotechnological processes."
1106,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA-BSI) 
are a significant cause of mortality. We analysed the evolution of the molecular 
and clinical epidemiology of MRSA-BSI (n = 784) in adult patients (Barcelona, 
1990-2019). Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and genotyped 
(PFGE), and a selection was sequenced (WGS) to characterise the pangenome and 
mechanisms underlying antimicrobial resistance. Increases in patient age (60 to 
71 years), comorbidities (Charlson's index &gt; 2, 10% to 94%), community-onset 
healthcare-associated acquisition (9% to 60%), and 30-day mortality (28% to 36%) 
were observed during the 1990-1995 and 2014-2019 periods. The proportion of 
catheter-related BSIs fell from 57% to 20%. Current MRSA-BSIs are caused by 
CC5-IV and an upward trend of CC8-IV and CC22-IV clones. CC5 and CC8 had the 
lowest core genome proportions. Antimicrobial resistance rates fell, and only 
ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, and erythromycin remained high (&gt;50%) due to 
GyrA/GrlA changes, the presence of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes 
(AAC(6')-Ie-APH(2″)-Ia and ANT(4')-Ia), and mph(C)/msr(A) or erm (C) genes. Two 
CC22-IV strains showed daptomycin resistance (MprF substitutions). MRSA-BSI has 
become healthcare-associated, affecting elderly patients with comorbidities and 
causing high mortality rates. Clonal replacement with CC5-IV and CC8-IV clones 
resulted in lower antimicrobial resistance rates. The increased frequency of the 
successful CC22-IV, associated with daptomycin resistance, should be monitored."
1107,"BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
pathogen, causing both community- and healthcare-associated infections. The 
resistance is due to the continuous accumulation of multiple 
antibiotic-resistance-genes (ARGs) through spontaneous genomic mutations and the 
acquisition of conjugative plasmids. This study presents antibiotics resistance 
genes, plasmids replicons, and virulence genes of K. pneumoniae isolates from 
clinical specimens in a tertiary hospital, Mwanza, Tanzania.
METHODS: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 34 K. pneumoniae was performed, using 
an Illumina NextSeq 500, followed by in silco analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 34 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae, 
isolated from blood samples from neonatal units were whole-genome sequenced. Of 
these, 28 (82.4%) had an identified sequence type (ST), with ST14 (39.3%, n = 
11) being frequently identified. Moreover, 18 (52.9%) of the bacteria harbored 
at least one plasmid, from which a total of 25 plasmid replicons were identified 
with a predominance of IncFIB(K) 48.0% (n = 12). Out of 34 sequenced K. 
pneumoniae, 32 (94.1%) were harboring acquired 
antibiotic/biocides-resistance-genes (ARGs) with a predominance of blaCTX-M-15 
(90.6%), followed by oqxB (87.5%), oqxA (84.4%), blaTEM-1B (84.4%) and sul2 
(84.4%). Interestingly, we observed the ColRNAI plasmid-replicon (n = 1) and 
qacE gene (n = 4) for the first time in this setting.
CONCLUSION: Global high-risk clones of K. pneumoniae isolates carry multiple 
ARGs in multiple plasmid-replicons. Findings from this study warrant 
genomic-based surveillance to monitor high-risk global clones, epidemic plasmids 
and ARGs in low- and middle-income countries."
1108,"Bacterial species of the Streptococcus genera are considered either commensal 
bacteria or potential pathogens, according to their metabolic evolution and 
production of quorum sensing (QS)-controlled virulence factors. S. mutans, in 
particular, has become one of the best-studied examples of bacteria that are 
able to get along or cheat commensal species, even of the same genera. S. mutans 
and S. pneumoniae share homolog QS pathways and a competence stimulating peptide 
(CSP) for regulating bacteriocin production. Intriguingly, the abundance of S. 
pneumoniae and S. mutans alternates in complex microbial communities, thus 
opening the role for the fratricide communication of homolog QS systems. Since 
the inhibition of the QS has been proposed in treating bacterial infections, in 
this study, we designed and synthesized analogs of S. pneumoniae CSP with 
precise residual modifications. We reported that S. pneumoniae CSP analogs 
reduced the expression of genes involved in the QS of S. mutans and biofilm 
formation without affecting bacterial growth. The CSP analogs inhibited 
bacteriocin production in S. mutans, as reported by co-cultures with commensal 
bacteria of the oral cavity. The peptide CSP1AA, bearing substitutions in the 
residues involved in QS receptor recognition and activation, reported the most 
significant quorum-quenching activities. Our findings provide new insights into 
specific chemical drivers in the CSP sequences controlling the interconnection 
between S. mutans and S. pneumoniae. We think that the results reported in this 
study open the way for new therapeutic interventions in controlling the 
virulence factors in complex microbial communities such as the oral microbiota."
1109,"We previously reported the emergence of amitraz-resistant Rhipicephalus 
(Boophilus) decoloratus ticks in the western region of Uganda. This study 
characterized the octopamine/tyramine receptor gene (OCT/Tyr) of 
amitraz-resistant and -susceptible R. (B.) decoloratus ticks from four regions 
of Uganda. The OCT/Tyr gene was amplified from genomic DNA of 17 R. (B.) 
decoloratus larval populations of known susceptibility to amitraz. The amplicons 
were purified, cloned and sequenced to determine mutations in the partial coding 
region of the OCT/Tyr gene. The amplified R. (B.) decoloratus OCT/Tyr gene was 
91-100% identical to the R. (B.) microplus OCT/Tyr gene. Up to 24 single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in the OCT/Tyr gene from ticks 
obtained from high acaricide pressure areas, compared to 8 from the low 
acaricide pressure areas. A total of eight amino acid mutations were recorded in 
the partial OCT/Tyr gene from ticks from the western region, and four of them 
were associated with amitraz-resistant tick populations. The amino acid 
mutations M1G, L16F, D41G and V72A were associated with phenotypic resistance to 
amitraz with no specific pattern. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 
OCT/Tyr gene sequence from this study clustered into two distinct groups that 
separated the genotype from high acaricide pressure areas from the susceptible 
populations. In conclusion, this study is the first to characterize the R. (B.) 
decoloratus OCT/Tyr receptor gene and reports four novel amino acid mutations 
associated with phenotypic amitraz resistance in Uganda. However, lack of 
mutations in the ORF of the OCT/Tyr gene fragment for some of the 
amitraz-resistant R. (B.) decoloratus ticks could suggest that other mechanisms 
of resistance may be responsible for amitraz resistance, hence the need for 
further investigation."
1110,"Clostridioides difficile causes the highest number of nosocomial infections. 
Currently, treatment options for C. difficile infection (CDI) are very limited, 
resulting in poor treatment outcomes and high recurrence rates. Although the 
disease caused by CDI is inflammatory in nature, the role of inflammation in the 
development of CDI symptoms is contradictory and not completely understood. 
Hence, the use of anti-inflammatory medication is debatable in CDI. In the 
current study, we evaluated the genetic and microbiome profiles of mice after 
infection with C. difficile. These mice were categorized based on the severity 
of CDI and the results were viewed accordingly. Our results indicate that 
certain genes are upregulated in severe CDI more than in the moderate case. 
These include oncostatin-M (OSM), matrix metalloprotease 8 (MMP8), triggering 
receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (Trem-1), and dual oxidase 2 (Duox2). We 
also investigated the microbiome composition of CDI mice before and after 
infecting with C. difficile. The results show that C. difficile abundance is not 
indicative of diseases severity. Certain bacterial species (e.g., Citrobacter) 
were enriched while others (e.g., Turicibacter) were absent in severe CDI. This 
study identifies novel inflammatory pathways and bacterial species with a 
potential role in determining the severity of CDI."
1111,"Paramecium is a free-living ciliate that undergoes antigenic variation and still 
the functions of these variable surface antigen coats in this non-pathogenic 
ciliate remain elusive. Only a few surface antigen genes have been described, 
mainly in the two model species P. tetraurelia strain 51 and P. primaurelia 
strain 156. Given the lack of suitable sequence data to allow for phylogenetics 
and deeper sequence comparisons, we screened the genomes of six different 
Paramecium species for serotype genes and isolated 548 candidates. Our approach 
identified the subfamilies of the isogenes of individual serotypes that were 
mostly represented by intrachromosomal gene duplicates. These showed different 
duplication levels, and chromosome synteny suggested rather young duplication 
events after the emergence of the P. aurelia species complex, indicating a rapid 
evolution of surface antigen genes. We were able to identify the different 
subfamilies of the surface antigen genes with internal tandem repeats, which 
showed consensus motifs across species. The individual isogene families showed 
additional consensus motifs, indicating that the selection pressure holds 
individual amino acids constant in these repeats. This may be a hint of the 
receptor function of these antigens rather than a presentation of random 
epitopes, generating the variability of these surface molecules."
1112,"The Anaplasmataceae family encompasses obligate intracellular α-proteobacteria 
of human and veterinary medicine importance. This study performed multi-locus 
sequencing to characterize Ehrlichia and Anaplasma in coati's blood samples in 
Midwestern Brazil. Twenty-five samples (25/165-15.1%) were positive in the 
screening PCR based on the dsb gene of Ehrlichia spp. and were characterized 
using 16S rRNA, sodB, groEL, and gltA genes and the 23S-5S intergenic space 
region (ITS). Phylogenetic analyses based on all six molecular markers 
positioned the sequences into a new clade, with a common origin of Ehrlichia 
ruminantium. Haplotype analyses of 16S RNA sequences revealed the presence of 
two distinct Ehrlichia genotypes. Six samples (6/165, 3.6%) were positive in the 
screening nPCR for the 16S rRNA gene of Anaplasma spp. and were submitted to an 
additional PCR targeting the ITS for molecular characterization. Phylogenetic 
analyses based on both 16S rRNA gene and ITS positioned the Anaplasma sp. 
detected in the present study in a large clade with other Anaplasma sp. 
previously detected in ticks and wild animals and in a clade with 'Candidatus 
Anaplasma brasiliensis', respectively. Based on distinct molecular markers, the 
present work described a putative novel Anaplasmataceae agent, namely 
'Candidatus Ehrlichia dumleri', and Anaplasma sp. closely related to the 
previously described 'Candidatus Anaplasma brasiliensis'."
1113,"The mycobiome in the rhizosphere and within the roots benefits the nutrition and 
function of host plants. However, compared with the bacterial community, 
root-associated mycobiomes of desert plants and the forces that drive their 
assemblage are limited. Here, we investigated the mycobiomes in bulk soil, 
rhizosphere, and root compartments of Alhagi sparsifolia Shap., a phreatophyte 
species dominating in Central Asia. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene 
phylogenetic profiles displayed significantly diverse mycobiomes across three 
compartments and host growth times, together explaining 31.45% of the variation 
in the community composition. The community structure of the perennial stage was 
markedly different from that of other stages (30 days to 2 years old). Along the 
soil-plant continuum, the α-diversity (estimated by Chao1) decreased gradually, 
while concomitantly increasing the community dissimilarity and the influence of 
edaphic factors. Specific leaf area, soil water content, and soil organic matter 
levels were common factors driving the composition of the three mycobiome 
communities. A more complex and connected network was observed in the root 
community compared with the other compartments. Overall, our work suggests that 
an age-sensitive host effect restructured the desert-plant-root-associated 
mycobiome, and that edaphic factors and host growth strategy may play potential 
roles in this process."
1114,"The rice-fish system (RFS), a traditional coculture farming model, was selected 
as a ""globally important agricultural heritage system."" Host-associated 
microbiota play important roles in development, metabolism, physiology, and 
immune function. However, studies on the gut microbiota of aquatic animals in 
the RFS are scarce, especially the lack of baseline knowledge of the dynamics of 
gut microbial communities in rice fish during different developmental stages. In 
this study, we characterized the microbial composition, community structure, and 
functions of several sympatric aquatic animals (common carp (Cyprinus carpio), 
crucian carp (Carassius carassius), and black-spotted frogs (Pelophylax 
nigromaculatus)), and the environment (water) in the RFS using 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing. Moreover, we investigated stage-specific signatures in the gut 
microbiota of common carp throughout the three developmental stages (juvenile, 
sub-adult, and adult). Our results indicated that the Fusobacteriota, 
Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes were dominant gut microbial phyla in rice fish. 
The differences in gut microbial compositions and community structure between 
the three aquatic species were observed. Although no significant differences in 
alpha diversity were observed across the three developmental stages, the 
microbial composition and community structure varied with development in common 
carp in the RFS, with an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes in 
sub-adults and a shift in the functional features of the community. This study 
sheds light on the gut microbiota of aquatic animals in the RFS. It deepens our 
understanding of the dynamics of gut microflora during common carp development, 
which may help improve aquaculture strategies in the RFS."
1115,"Thermophiles that produce extracellular hydrolases are of great importance due 
to their applications in various industries. Thermophilic enzymes are of 
interest for industrial applications due to their compatibility with industrial 
processes, and the availability of the organisms is essential to develop their 
full potential. In this study, a culture-dependent approach was used to identify 
thermophilic bacteria from five hot springs in Republic of Korea. 
Characterization, taxonomic identification, and extracellular hydrolase 
(amylase, lipase, and protease) activity of 29 thermophilic bacterial isolates 
from the Neungam carbonate, Mungang sulfur, Deokgu, Baegam, and Dongnae hot 
springs were investigated. Identification based on the full-length 16S rRNA gene 
sequence revealed that strains belonged to the phylum Bacillota and were 
classified as Aeribacillus, Bacillus, Caldibacillus, Geobacillus, and 
Thermoactinomyces genera. It was found that 22 isolates could produce at least 
one extracellular enzyme. Geobacillus, representing 41.4% of the isolates, was 
the most abundant. The highest amount of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes was 
secreted by strains of the genus Geobacillus, whereas Caldibacillus species 
produced the highest amount of amylolytic enzyme. The Geobacillus species 
producing hydrolytic extracellular enzymes appeared to be the most promising."
1116,"Mitochondrial biogenesis is tightly regulated in response to extracellular and 
intracellular signals, thereby adapting yeast cells to changes in their 
environment. The Hap2/3/4/5 complex is a master transcriptional regulator of 
mitochondrial biogenesis in yeast. Hap4 is the regulatory subunit of the complex 
and exhibits increased expression when the Hap2/3/4/5 complex is activated. In 
cells grown under glucose derepression conditions, both the HAP4 transcript 
level and Hap4 protein level are increased. As part of an inter-organellar 
signaling mechanism coordinating gene expression between the mitochondrial and 
nuclear genomes, the activity of the Hap2/3/4/5 complex is reduced in 
respiratory-deficient cells, such as ρ0 cells lacking mitochondrial DNA, as a 
result of reduced Hap4 protein levels. However, the underlying mechanism is 
unclear. Here, we show that reduced HAP4 expression in ρ0 cells is mediated 
through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. We show that 
loss of mitochondrial DNA increases the turnover of Hap4, which requires the 26S 
proteasome and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc1 and Ubc4. Stabilization of 
Hap4 in the ubc1 ubc4 double mutant leads to increased expression of 
Hap2/3/4/5-target genes. Our results indicate that mitochondrial biogenesis in 
yeast is regulated by the functional state of mitochondria partly through 
ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent turnover of Hap4."
1117,"Under bile salt treatment, strains display significant differences in their 
tolerance ability, suggesting the existence of diverse resistance mechanisms in 
Lactobacillus; however, the genes involved in this protective process are not 
fully understood. In this study, novel target genes associated with bile salt 
tolerance in Lactobacillus were identified using comparative genomics for PCR 
detection and the rapid screening of tolerant strains. The bile salt tolerance 
of 107 lactobacilli isolated from different origins was assessed, and 26 strains 
with comparatively large differences were selected for further comparative 
genomic analysis. Tolerant strains had 112 specific genes that were enriched in 
the phosphotransferase system, the two-component system, carbohydrate 
metabolism, and the ATP-binding cassette transporter. Six genes from 
Lactobacillus were cloned into the inducible lactobacillal expression vector 
pSIP403. Overexpression in the host strain increased its tolerance ability by 
11.86-18.08%. The novel genes identified here can be used as targets to design 
primers for the rapid screening of bile salt-tolerant lactobacilli. Altogether, 
these results deepen our understanding of bile salt tolerance mechanisms in 
Lactobacillus and provide a basis for further rapid assessments of tolerant 
strains."
1118,"The transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) is the central pivot of a 
prokaryotic organism to receive, process and respond to internal and external 
environmental information. However, little is known about its spatial 
organization so far. In recent years, chromatin interaction data of bacteria 
such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis have been published, making it 
possible to study the spatial organization of bacterial transcriptional 
regulatory networks. By combining TRNs and chromatin interaction data of E. coli 
and B. subtilis, we explored the spatial organization characteristics of 
bacterial TRNs in many aspects such as regulation directions (positive and 
negative), central nodes (hubs, bottlenecks), hierarchical levels (top, middle, 
bottom) and network motifs (feed-forward loops and single input modules) of the 
TRNs and found that the bacterial TRNs have a variety of stable spatial 
organization features under different physiological conditions that may be 
closely related with biological functions. Our findings provided new insights 
into the connection between transcriptional regulation and the spatial 
organization of chromosome in bacteria and might serve as a factual foundation 
for trying spatial-distance-based gene circuit design in synthetic biology."
1119,"The use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for bacterial characterisation has 
increased substantially in the last decade. Its high throughput and decreasing 
cost have led to significant changes in outbreak investigations and surveillance 
of a wide variety of microbial pathogens. Despite the innumerable advantages of 
WGS, several drawbacks concerning data analysis and management, as well as a 
general lack of standardisation, hinder its integration in routine use. In this 
work, a bioinformatics workflow for (Illumina) WGS data is presented for 
bacterial characterisation including genome annotation, species identification, 
serotype prediction, antimicrobial resistance prediction, virulence-related 
genes and plasmid replicon detection, core-genome-based or single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogenetic clustering and sequence typing. Workflow 
was tested using a collection of 22 in-house sequences of Salmonella enterica 
isolates belonging to a local outbreak, coupled with a collection of 182 
Salmonella genomes publicly available. No errors were reported during the 
execution period, and all genomes were analysed. The bioinformatics workflow can 
be tailored to other pathogens of interest and is freely available for academic 
and non-profit use as an uploadable file to the Galaxy platform."
1120,"Yersinia enterocolitica (Y. enterocolitica) is an important food-borne and 
zoonotic pathogen. It can form biofilm on the surface of food, increasing the 
risk to food safety. Generally, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are spherical 
nanostructures secreted by Gram-negative bacteria during growth. They play a 
role in biological processes because they contain biologically active molecules. 
Several studies have reported that OMVs secreted by various bacteria are 
associated with the formation of biofilms. However, the interactions between Y. 
enterocolitica OMVs and biofilm are unknown. This study aims to investigate the 
effect of Y. enterocolitica OMVs on biofilm formation. Firstly, OMVs were 
extracted from Y. enterocolitica Y1083, which has a strong biofilm-forming 
ability, at 15 °C, 28 °C and 37 °C and then characterized. The characterization 
results showed differences in the yield and protein content of three types of 
OMVs. Next, by co-culturing the OMVs with Y. enterocolitica, it was observed 
that the OMVs inhibited the initial stage of Y. enterocolitica biofilm formation 
but did not affect the growth of Y. enterocolitica. Furthermore, biofilm 
formation by Salmonella enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus were also 
inhibited by OMVs. Subsequently, it was proved that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in 
OMVs inhibited biofilm formation., The proteins, DNA or RNA in OMVs could not 
inhibit biofilm formation. Bacterial motility and the expression of the 
biofilm-related genes pgaABC, motB and flhBD were inhibited by LPS. LPS 
demonstrated good anti-biofilm activity against various bacteria. This study 
provides a new approach to the prevention and control of pathogenic bacterial 
biofilm."
1121,"Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major pathogen 
responsible for human hospital and community-onset diseases and severe invasive 
livestock infections. Rapid detection of MRSA is essential to control the spread 
of MRSA. Conventional identification methods and antibacterial susceptibility 
tests of MRSA are time-consuming. The commonly used qPCR assay also has the 
disadvantages of being complicated and expensive, restricting its application in 
resource-limited clinical laboratories. Here, a real-time fluorescent 
recombinase-assisted amplification (RAA) assay targeting the most conserved 
regions within the mecA gene of MRSA was developed and evaluated to detect MRSA. 
The detection limit of this assay was determined to be 10 copies/reaction of 
positive plasmids. The established RAA assay showed high specificity for MRSA 
detection without cross-reactivities with other clinically relevant bacteria. 
The diagnostic performance of real-time RAA was evaluated using 67 clinical S. 
aureus isolates from dairy farms, which were detected in parallel using the 
TaqMan probe qPCR assay. The results showed that 56 and 54 samples tested 
positive for MRSA by RAA and qPCR, respectively. The overall agreement between 
both assays was 97.01% (65/67), with a kappa value of 0.9517 (p &lt; 0.001). 
Further linear regression analysis demonstrated that the detection results 
between the two assays were significantly correlated (R2 = 0.9012, p &lt; 
0.0001), indicating that this RAA assay possesses similar detection performance 
to the qPCR assay. In conclusion, our newly established RAA assay is a 
time-saving and convenient diagnostic tool suitable for MRSA detection and 
screening."
1122,"Microecological preparation could relieve Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 
(ETEC) K88-induced diarrhea in piglets, but which bacteria play a key role and 
the mitigation mechanism have not been fully clarified. In this study, 36 male 
mice were randomly divided into six groups (CON, K88, BK (Bifidobacterium longum 
+ K88), LK (Lactobacillus plantarum + K88), PK (Pediococcus acidilactici + K88), 
and MK (mixed strains + K88)) to explore the prevention mechanisms. Three 
probiotic strains and their mixtures (TPSM) significantly relieved the weight 
loss and restored the ratio of villus height to crypt depth in the jejunum. 
Except for Bifidobacterium longum, other strains significantly decreased 
interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in mice serum. The 
TPSM treatment significantly downregulated the mRNA expression of the 
inflammatory cytokines and the Toll-like receptor and downstream gene (TLR4, 
MyD88, NF-κB) in jejunum induced by ETEC. Furthermore, the TPSM could restore 
dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota caused by ETEC. The intestinal microbiota 
analysis demonstrated that Bifidobacterium longum enriched the Bifidobacterium 
genus (p &lt; 0.05), Lactobacillus plantarum enriched the Lactobacillus genus (p 
&lt; 0.05), Pediococcus acidilactici enriched the Coriobacteriaceae_UCG-002 and 
Christensenellaceae_R-7_group genus (p &lt; 0.05), mixed bacteria enriched the 
Akkermansia genus (p &lt; 0.05), but ETEC enriched the Desulfovibrio genus (p 
&lt; 0.05). Meanwhile, the starch and sucrose metabolism, galactose and fructose 
metabolism, mannose metabolism and ABC transporters were increased with 
probiotics pre-treatment (p &lt; 0.05). To sum up, the microecological 
preparation alleviated ETEC-induced diarrhea by regulating the immune response, 
rebalancing intestinal microbiota and improving carbohydrate metabolism."
1123,"(1) Background: Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a polyanionic mucopolysaccharide 
extensively used in biomedical and cosmetic industries due to its unique 
rheological properties. Recombinant HA production using other microbial 
platforms has received increasing interest to avoid potential toxin 
contamination associated with its production by streptococcal fermentation. In 
this study, the Gram-negative strains Escherichia coli (pLysY/Iq), E. coli 
Rosetta2, E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS, E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3), E. coli Rosetta 
gammiB(DE3)pLysS, and the Gram-positive Bacillus megaterium (MS941) were 
investigated as new platforms for the heterologous production of HA. (2) 
Results: The HA biosynthesis gene hasA, cloned from Streptococcus equi subsp. 
zoopedemicus, was ligated into plasmid pMM1522 (MoBiTec), resulting in pMM1522 
hasA, which was introduced into E. coli Rosetta-2(DE3) and B. megaterium 
(MS941). The initial HA titer by the two hosts in the LB medium was 5 mg/L and 
50 mg/L, respectively. Streptococcal hasABC and hasABCDE genes were ligated into 
plasmid pPT7 (MoBiTec) and different E. coli host strains were then transformed 
with the resulting plasmids pPT7hasABC and pPT7hasABCDE. For E. coli 
Rosetta-gamiB(DE3)pLysS transformed with pPT7hasABC, HA production was 500 ± 
11.4 mg/L in terrific broth (TB) medium. Productivity was slightly higher (585 ± 
2.9 mg/L) when the same host was transformed with pPT7 carrying the entire HA 
operon. We also transformed B. megaterium (MS941) protoplasts carrying T7-RNAP 
with pPT7hasABC and pPT7hasABCDE. In comparison, the former plasmid resulted in 
HA titers of 2116.7 ± 44 and 1988.3 ± 19.6 mg/L in LB media supplemented with 5% 
sucrose and A5 medium + MOPSO, respectively; the latter plasmid boosted the 
titer final concentration further to reach 2476.7 ± 14.5 mg/L and 2350 ± 28.8 
mg/L in the two media, respectively. The molecular mass of representative HA 
samples ranged from 105 - 106 Daltons (Da), and the polydispersity index (PDI) 
was &lt;2. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the HA 
product were identical to those obtained for commercially available standard 
polymers. Finally, scanning electron microscopic examination revealed the 
presence of extensive HA capsules in E. coli Rosetta-gamiB(DE3)pLysS, while no 
HA capsules were produced by B. megaterium. (3) Conclusions: Our results 
suggested that Gram-positive bacteria are probably superior host strains for 
recombinant HA production over their Gram-negative counters. The titers and the 
molecular weight (MW) of HA produced by B. megaterium were significantly higher 
than those obtained by different E. coli host strains used in this study."
1124,"The common methods that are presently used to identify Vibrio harveyi include 
microscopic examination and biochemical, immunological and PCR-based assays. 
These methods require technical expertise, and can be time-consuming. A rapid 
method is required for the high-throughput screening of large number of samples. 
As such, we have developed a rapid, simple yet sensitive and specific detection 
method based on the use of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of 
DNA. A set of six primers, i.e., two outer, two inner and two loop primers, was 
designed based on the in silico analysis of a large pool of 39 strains of the 
toxR gene sequence of V. harveyi. The addition of the loop primers decreased the 
reaction time of the LAMP by more than half. Furthermore, with the application 
of SYBR Green, the result can be obtained as quickly as in 10 to 15 min without 
the need of gel electrophoresis. The specificity of the method primers was then 
determined by performing LAMP with Vibrio and non-Vibrio samples. LAMP has a 
greater sensitivity than PCR reaction. The sensitivity of PCR was at 0.6 pg 
concentration of V. harveyi recombinant plasmid DNA standard, while LAMP was 
able to detect lower amounts even at 0.6 fg. The development of the LAMP assay 
will provide a valuable tool for the high-throughput rapid detection of V. 
harveyi contamination both in laboratories and in the field."
1125,"BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome contributes to numerous physiological processes 
in humans, and diet and exercise are known to alter both microbial composition 
and mood. We sought to explore the effect of a 10-week resistance training (RT) 
regimen with or without peanut protein supplementation (PPS) in untrained young 
adults on fecal microbiota and mood disturbance (MD).
METHODS: Participants were randomized into PPS (n = 25) and control (CTL [no 
supplement]; n = 24) groups and engaged in supervised, full-body RT twice a 
week. Measures included body composition, fecal microbe relative abundance, 
alpha- and beta-diversity from 16 s rRNA gene sequencing with QIIME2 processing, 
dietary intake at baseline and following the 10-week intervention, and 
post-intervention MD via the profile of mood states (POMS) questionnaire. 
Independent samples t-tests were used to determine differences between PPS and 
CTL groups. Paired samples t-tests investigated differences within groups.
RESULTS: Our sample was mostly female (69.4%), white (87.8%), normal weight 
(body mass index 24.6 ± 4.2 kg/m2), and 21 ± 2.0 years old. Shannon index 
significantly increased from baseline in all participants (p = 0.040), with no 
between-group differences or pre-post beta-diversity dissimilarities. Changes in 
Blautia abundance were associated with the positive POMS subscales, Vigor and 
self-esteem-related-affect (SERA) (rho = -0.451, p = 0.04; rho = -0.487, p = 
0.025, respectively). Whole tree phylogeny changes were negatively correlated 
with SERA and Vigor (rho = -0.475, p = 0.046; rho = -0.582, p = 0.011, 
respectively) as well as change in bodyfat percentage (rho = -0.608, p = 0.007). 
Mediation analysis results indicate changes in PD Whole Tree Phylogeny was not a 
significant mediator of the relationship between change in fat-free mass and 
total MD.
CONCLUSIONS: Mood state subscales are associated with changes in microbial taxa 
and body composition. PD Whole Tree Phylogeny increased following the 10-week RT 
regimen; further research is warranted to explore how RT-induced changes in 
microbial diversity are related to changes in body composition and mood 
disturbance."
1126,"Cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is synthesized by diguanylate 
cyclase (DGC) with the GGDEF domain. As a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger, 
it regulates diverse life-activity phenotypes in some bacteria. Although 38 
genes encoding GGDEF-domain-containing proteins have been identified in the 
genome of the Pseudomonas glycinae strain MS82, whether c-di-GMP functions as a 
facilitator or repressor of life-activity phenotypes is poorly understood. In 
this study, one of the 38 genes containing a GGDEF domain in MS82, PafS was 
investigated to explore its regulatory function in bacterial life activities. 
The PafS-deletion mutant ΔPafS and reversion mutant PafS-comp were constructed 
by the method of biparental conjugation and homologous recombination. The life 
activities of the mutants, such as antifungal activity, biofilm formation 
ability, polysaccharide content, and motor behavior, were explored. The results 
showed that all life-activity phenotypes were significantly reduced after 
knocking out PafS, whereas all were significantly restored to a similar level to 
that of MS82 after the complementation of PafS. These results suggested that 
PafS plays an important role in the regulation of a range of cellular activities 
by c-di-GMP in P. glycinae MS82."
1127,"Actinomycetes are one of the main producers of biologically active compounds. 
However, their capabilities have not been fully evaluated due to the presence of 
many unexpressed silent clusters; moreover, actinomycetes can probably produce 
new or previously discovered natural products under certain conditions. 
Overexpressing the adpA gene into streptomycetes strains can unlock silent 
biosynthetic gene clusters. Herein, we showed that by applying this approach to 
Streptomyces sp. Pv 4-95 isolated from Phyllostachys viridiglaucescens 
rhizosphere soil, two new mass peaks were identified. NMR structure analysis 
identified these compounds as flavacol and a new 3-β-hydroxy flavacol 
derivative. We suggest that the presence of heterologous AdpA has no direct 
effect on the synthesis of flavacol and its derivatives in the Pv 4-95 strain. 
However, AdpA affects the synthesis of precursors by increasing their quantity, 
which then condenses into the resulting compounds."
1128,"In natural settings, approximately 40-80% of bacteria exist as biofilms, most of 
which are mixed-species biofilms. Previous studies have typically focused on 
single- or dual-species biofilms. To expand the field of study on gut biofilms, 
we found a group of gut microbiota that can form biofilms well in vitro: 
Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides 
ovatus, and Lactobacillus gasseri. The increase in biomass and bio-volume of the 
mixed-species biofilm was confirmed via crystal violet staining, field emission 
scanning electron microscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy, revealing 
a strong synergistic relationship in these communities, with B. longum being the 
key biofilm-contributing species. This interaction may be related to changes in 
the cell number, biofilm-related genes, and metabolic activities. After 
quantifying the cell number using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, B. 
longum and L. gasseri were found to be the dominant flora in the mixed-species 
biofilm. In addition, this study analyzed biological properties of mixed-species 
biofilms, such as antibiotic resistance, cell metabolic activity, and 
concentration of water-insoluble polysaccharides. Compared with single-species 
biofilms, mixed-species biofilms had higher metabolic activity, more 
extracellular matrix, and greater antibiotic resistance. From these results, we 
can see that the formation of biofilms is a self-protection mechanism of gut 
microbiota, and the formation of mixed-species biofilms can greatly improve the 
survival rate of different strains. Finally, this study is a preliminary 
exploration of the biological characteristics of gut biofilms, and the molecular 
mechanisms underlying the formation of biofilms warrant further research."
1129,"Despite the great importance of gills for bivalve mollusks (respiration, 
feeding, immunity), the microbiota associated with this tissue has barely been 
characterized in scallops. The scallop Argopecten purpuratus is an important 
economic resource that is cultivated in areas where coastal upwelling is 
intensifying by climate change, potentially affecting host-microbiota 
interactions. Thus, we first characterized the bacterial community present in 
gills from cultivated scallops (by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) and 
assessed their stability and functional potential in animals under farm and 
laboratory conditions. Results showed that under both conditions the gill 
bacterial community is dominated by the phylum Campylobacterota (57%), which 
displays a chemoautotrophic potential that could contribute to scallop 
nutrition. Within this phylum, two phylotypes, namely symbionts A and B, were 
the most abundant; being, respectively, taxonomically affiliated to symbionts 
with nutritional functions in mussel gills, and to uncultured bacteria present 
in coral mucus. Additionally, in situ hybridization and scanning electron 
microscopy analyses allowed us to detect these symbionts in the gills of A. 
purpuratus. Given that shifts in upwelling phenology can cause disturbances to 
ecosystems, affecting bacteria that provide beneficial functions to the host, we 
further assessed the changes in the abundance of the two symbionts (via qPCR) in 
response to a simulated upwelling intensification. The exposure to combined 
decreasing values in the temperature, pH, and oxygen levels (upwelling 
conditions) favored the dominance of symbiont B over symbiont A; suggesting that 
symbiont abundances are modulated by these environmental changes. Overall, 
results showed that changes in the main Campylobacterota phylotypes in response 
to upwelling intensification could affect its symbiotic function in A. 
purpuratus under future climate change scenarios. These results provide the 
first insight into understanding how scallop gill-microbial systems adapt and 
respond to climate change stressors, which could be critical for managing 
health, nutrition, and scallop aquaculture productivity."
1130,"Microbial degradation of natural rubber and synthetic poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) is 
expected to become an alternative treatment system for waste from 
poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) products including scrap tires. Nocardia farcinica NBRC 
15,532, a gram-positive rubber-degrading bacterium, can utilize 
poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) as the sole source of carbon and energy to produce 
oligo-isoprene metabolites containing aldehyde and keto end groups. A 
homology-based search of the genome revealed a gene encoding a latex-clearing 
protein (Lcp). Gene disruption analysis indicated that this gene is essential 
for the utilization of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) in this strain. Further analysis 
of the genome sequence identified aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) genes as 
potential candidates for oxidative degradation of oligo-isoprene aldehydes. 
Based on the enzymatic activity of the ALDH candidates, NF2_RS14000 and 
NF2_RS14385 may be involved in the degradation of oligo-isoprene aldehydes. 
Analysis of the reaction products revealed that these ALDHs oxidized tri- to 
penta-isoprene aldehydes, which were generated by the reaction of Lcp. Based on 
the inability of ALDH gene deletion mutants, we concluded that NF2_RS14000 is 
mainly involved in the utilization of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) and the oxidative 
degradation of oligo-isoprene aldehydes in Nocardia farcinica NBRC 15,532."
1131,"This study investigated enzymatic and genetic determinants of bacterial 
resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in the biocenosis involved in the process of 
biological treatment of wastewater by activated sludge. The frequency of 
bacteria resistant to selected antibiotics and the activity of enzymes 
responsible for resistance to β-lactam antibiotics were estimated. The 
phenomenon of selection and spread of a number of genes determining antibiotic 
resistance was traced using PCR and gene sequencing. An increase in the 
percentage of bacteria showing resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in the 
microflora of wastewater during the treatment process was found. The highest 
number of resistant microorganisms, including multi-resistant strains, was 
recorded in the aeration chamber. Significant amounts of these bacteria were 
also present in treated wastewater, where the percentage of penicillin-resistant 
bacteria exceeded 50%, while those resistant to the new generation β-lactam 
antibiotics meropenem and imipenem were found at 8.8% and 6.4%, respectively. 
Antibiotic resistance was repeatedly accompanied by the activity of enzymes such 
as carbapenemases, metallo-β-lactamases, cephalosporinases and β-lactamases with 
an extended substrate spectrum. The activity of carbapenemases was shown in up 
to 97% of the multi-resistant bacteria. Studies using molecular biology 
techniques showed a high frequency of genes determining resistance to β-lactam 
antibiotics, especially the blaTEM1 gene. The analysis of the nucleotide 
sequences of blaTEM1 gene variants present in bacteria at different stages of 
wastewater treatment showed 50-100% mutual similarity of."
1132,"In this study, we investigated the immune-enhancing and anti-viral effects of 
germinated Rhynchosia nulubilis (GRC) fermented with Pediococcus pentosaceus 
SC11 (GRC-SC11) isolated from a salted small octopus. The cordycepin, β-glucan, 
and total flavonoid contents increased in GRC after SC11 fermentation. GRC-SC11 
inhibits 3CL protease activity in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV). GRC-SC11 significantly increased thymus and spleen 
indices in immunocompromised mice. The rate of splenocyte proliferation was 
higher in GRC-SC11-treated immunocompromised mice than that in GRC-treated 
immunocompromised mice in the presence or absence of concanavalin A. In 
addition, GRC-SC11 increased the phagocytic activity and nitric oxide production 
in immunocompromised mice. The mRNA expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), 
interferon-alpha (IFN-α), and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) was 
up-regulated in GRC-SC11 treated RAW 264.7 macrophages, compared to GRC. Our 
study indicates that GRC-SC11 might be a potential therapeutic agent for 
immunocompromised patients who are vulnerable to SARS-CoV infection."
1133,"The low-land tapir (Tapirus terrestris) is the largest wild terrestrial mammal 
found in Brazil. Although T. terrestris has been already reported as a host of 
hemoparasites, the occurrence and genetic identity of Piroplasmida agents in 
this species is still cloudy. Although it is reported that Theileria equi, an 
endemic equid-infective agent in Brazil, is occurring in lowland tapirs, these 
reports are probably misconceived diagnoses since they are solely based on small 
fragments of 18S rRNA that may not achieve accurate topologies on phylogenetic 
analyses. The present study aimed to detect and investigate the identity of 
Theileria spp. in tapirs from Pantanal and Cerrado biomes. Blood-DNA samples 
from tapirs were screened for a partial (~800 bp) 18S rRNA gene fragment from 
Piroplasmida and 64 (64/122; 52.46% CI: 43.66-61.11%) presented bands of 
expected size. Samples were submitted to different protocols for molecular 
characterization, including near-full length 18S rRNA gene (~1500 bp), and the 
ema-1 gene from T. equi. Eight sequences were obtained for extended fragments 
(1182-1473 bp) from the 18S rRNA gene. Moreover, three sequences from partial 
cox-1 and five from partial hsp70 gene were obtained. None of the samples 
presented amplifications for the ema-1 gene. Phylogenetic and distance analyses 
from the 18S rRNA sequences obtained demonstrated a clear separation from 
tapirs' Theileria spp. and T. equi. Phylogenetic analyses of cox-1 and hsp70 
sequences obtained herein also showed a unique clade formed by tapir's Theileria 
spp. Theileria terrestris sp. nov. is positioned apart from all other Theileria 
species in 18S rRNA, cox-1, and hps70 phylogenetic analyses. This novel proposed 
species represents a new Piroplasmida clade, yet to be characterized regarding 
biological features, vectors involved in the transmission cycles, additional 
vertebrate hosts, and pathogenicity."
1134,"Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is one of the most commonly used bowel cleansing 
methods. Although the safety of PEG for bowel cleansing has been proven, its 
impact on intestinal microbiota has not been clearly explained, especially in 
terms of the dynamic changes in intestinal microbiota after PEG bowel cleansing, 
and there are no consistent results. In this study, stool samples were collected 
from 12 participants at six time points before and after bowel cleansing. We 
obtained data on the microbiota of these samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing 
and analysis. The data revealed that the structure and composition of the 
microbiota changed greatly approximately 7 d after intestinal cleansing. The 
analysis of the dynamic changes in the microbiota showed that the change was 
most significant at day 3, but the internal structure of the microbiota was 
similar to that before bowel cleansing. A comparison of the most significantly 
changed microbiota at different time points before and after bowel cleansing 
revealed four bacteria: Bacteroides, Roseburia, Eubacterium, and 
Bifidobacterium. We also established a humanized mouse model to simulate human 
bowel cleansing using PEG. The results showed that the mouse model achieved 
similar effects to human bowel cleansing, but its recovery speed was one stage 
earlier than that of humans. These findings suggest that the intestinal 
microbiota after bowel cleansing initially underwent a short-term change and 
then actively returned to its initial status. The results on key bacteria and 
establishment of mouse models can provide a reference for subsequent research on 
bowel cleansing."
1135,"At present, there is an increasing interest in beverages of non-dairy origin, as 
alternatives to those based on milk, but having similar health-promoting 
properties. Fermentation with specific bacteria or consortia may enhance the 
functionality of these products. In our study, selected lactic acid bacteria, 
that have been previously shown to possess functional properties (antimicrobial 
activity, probiotic potential), were used for the fermentation of wheat bran 
combined with root vegetables. Strains were investigated for their safety, while 
the obtained beverages were characterized in terms of microbial content, 
physical, chemical, nutritional, and functional properties. None of the strains 
harbors virulence genes, but all of them possess genes for survival at low pH, 
starch metabolism, and vitamin biosynthesis. Three strains (Lactiplantibacillus 
plantarum BR9, L. plantarum P35, and Lactobacillus acidophilus IBB801) and two 
substrates (5% wheat bran with 10% red beetroot/carrots) were selected based on 
a preliminary assessment of the beverage's sensory acceptability. These strains 
showed good growth and stability over time in the stored beverages. No 
enterobacteria were detected at the end of fermentations, while the final pH 
was, in most cases, below 3.5. Free phenolics, flavonoids, and DPPH scavenging 
effect increased during fermentation in all drinks, reaching 24h values that 
were much higher than in the unfermented substrates. Most of the obtained drinks 
were able to prevent the growth of certain pathogens, including Listeria 
monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Salmonella enterica ATCC 14028, Staphylococcus aureus 
ATCC 25923, and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. The obtained beverages would 
combine the nutritiveness of the raw ingredients with the beneficial effect of 
fermentation (increasing shelf life, health-promoting effect, pleasant flavor, 
etc.). They would also fill a gap in the non-dairy probiotics sector, which is 
constantly increasing due to the increasing number of vegan people or people 
that cannot consume dairy products."
1136,"Biochar and bioorganic fertilizers (BOF) that are used in agriculture can, both 
directly and indirectly, impact rhizosphere soil microorganisms. However, 
changes to the halophyte rhizosphere bacterial community after applying biochar 
and BOF to saline-alkali soil have not been thoroughly described. This study has 
investigated the bacterial communities of halophytes in saline-alkali soil 
through the addition of different biochar and BOF formulas using Illumina-based 
sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene fragment. B_BOF (biochar and BOF combined 
application) had the best effect, either by promoting the plant growth or by 
improving the physical and chemical properties of the soil. The concentration of 
the rhizosphere bacterial communities correlated with the changes in soil 
organic matter (OM) and organic carbon (OC). Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, 
Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteria accounted for &gt;80% of the total bacteria in 
each treatment. In addition, the abundance of Micromonospora was much higher in 
response to B_BOF than to the other treatments. BOF, with or without biochar, 
significantly influenced the bacterial community composition in the 
saline-alkali soil. The OC, OM, total nitrogen, and the available phosphorus had 
significant effects on the bacterial structure of this soil. The complex 
correlation of the bacterial communities between CK and B_BOF was higher 
compared to that between CK and FB or between CK and BOF. These findings 
suggested that the plant growth, the soil characteristics, and the diversity or 
community composition of the rhizosphere bacteria in saline-alkali soil were 
significantly influenced by B_BOF, followed by BOF, and then biochar; fine 
biochar had a stronger effect than medium or coarse biochar. This study provides 
an insight into the complex microbial compositions that emerge in response to 
biochar and BOF."
1137,"Aeromonas salmonicida, a psychrophilic bacterial pathogen, is widely distributed 
in marine freshwater, causing serious economic losses to major salmon farming 
areas in the world. At present, it is still one of the most important pathogens 
threatening salmon farming. Hcp (haemolysin-coregulated protein) is an effector 
protein in the type-VI secretion system (T6SS), which is secreted by T6SS and 
functions as its structural component. The results of our previous genomic 
sequencing showed that hcp existed in the mesophilic A. salmonicida SRW-OG1 
isolated from naturally infected Epinephelus coioides. To further explore the 
role of Hcp in A. salmonicida SRW-OG1, we constructed an hcp-RNAi strain and 
verified its effect on the virulence of A. salmonicida. The results showed that 
compared with the wild strain, the hcp-RNAi strain suffered from different 
degrees of decreased adhesion, growth, biofilm formation, extracellular product 
secretion, and virulence. It was suggested that hcp may be an important 
virulence gene of A. salmonicida SRW-OG1."
1138,"Protoplasts are widely used in gene function verification, subcellular 
localization, and single-cell sequencing because of their complete physiological 
activities. The traditional methods based on tissues and organs cannot satisfy 
the requirement. Therefore, the isolation and capture of a single protoplast are 
most important to these studies. In this study, a dual-channel microfluidic chip 
based on PDMS with multi-capture cavities was designed. The design theory of the 
dual-channel microfluidic chip's geometry was discussed. The capture mechanism 
of the single cell in a dual-channel microfluidic chip was studied by simulation 
analysis. Our results showed that a single polystyrene microsphere or tobacco 
protoplast was successfully isolated and trapped in this chip. The capture 
efficiency of the chip was 83.33% for the single tobacco protoplast when the 
inlet flow rate was 0.75 μL/min. In addition, the dynamic capture of the 
polystyrene microsphere and tobacco protoplasts was also presented. Overall, our 
study not only provided a new strategy for the subsequent high throughput single 
protoplast research, but also laid a theoretical foundation for the capture 
mechanism of the single cell."
1139,"Radix Polygoni Multiflori (PM) is a well-known nootropic used in traditional 
Chinese medicine (TCM). Considering the efficacy and application discrepancy 
between raw (RPM) and processed PM (PPM), the similarities and differences 
between them in the treatment of vascular dementia (VaD) is intriguing. In this 
study, a VaD rat model was constructed by 2-vessel occlusion (2-VO). During 28 
days of treatment, plasma was collected on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after the 
start of dosing and the metabolic profile was analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS-based 
metabolomics. The Morris Water Maze Test, hematoxylin-eosin and Nissl staining, 
and biochemical analysis were used to assess cognitive function, pathogenic 
alterations and oxidative stress, respectively. RPM and PPM 
effectivelyreducedthe 2VO-induced cognitive impairment and mitigated 
histological alterations in hippocampus tissue. The 2-VO model significantly 
elevated MDA level and decreased SOD activity and GSH level, indicating severe 
oxidative stress, which could also be attenuated by RPM and PPM treatment. RPM 
outperformed PPM in decreasing MDA levels while PPM outperformed RPM in 
increasing GSH levels. Differential metabolites were subjected to Metabolite Set 
Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) and genes corresponding to proteins having 
interactions with metabolites were further annotated with Gene Ontology (GO). 
Both RPM and PPM ameliorated VaD-relevant vitamin B6 metabolism, pentose 
phosphate pathways, and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. In addition, the 
metabolism of cysteine and methionine was regulated only by RPM, and riboflavin 
metabolism was modulated only by PPM. The results suggested that raw and 
processed PM had comparable efficacy in the treatment of VaD but also with some 
mechanistic differenece."
1140,"Tomato is abundant in alkaloids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids; however, the 
effect of transcription factor NOR-like1 on these metabolites in tomato is 
unclear. We used a combination of widely targeted metabolomics and 
transcriptomics to analyze wild-type tomatoes and CR-NOR-like1 tomatoes. A total 
of 83 alkaloids, 85 phenolic acids, and 96 flavonoids were detected with 
significant changes. Combined with a KEGG enrichment analysis, we revealed 16 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in alkaloid-related arginine and proline 
metabolism, 60 DEGs were identified in the phenolic acid-related phenylpropane 
biosynthesis, and 30 DEGs were identified in the flavonoid-related biosynthesis 
pathway. In addition, some highly correlated differential-expression genes with 
differential metabolites were further identified by correlation analysis. The 
present research provides a preliminary view of the effects of NOR-like1 
transcription factor on alkaloid, phenolic acid, and flavonoid accumulation in 
tomatoes at different ripening stages based on widely targeted metabolomics and 
transcriptomics in plants, laying the foundation for extending fruit longevity 
and shelf life as well as cultivating stress-resistant plants."
1141,"The ketogenic diet (KD), which is low in carbohydrates and high to normal in fat 
and protein, has been traditionally used in epilepsy for the last 100 years. 
More recently, its application in obesity has been introduced. The present 
review aimed to investigate the effects of the KD on vitamin D. In total, five 
studies were done in healthy adults, one in subjects with type 2 diabetes, and 
seven in subjects with epilepsy that assessed the levels of vitamin D pre- and 
post-intervention. In the majority of studies, increases in circulating vitamin 
D were reported. The relationship of the KD with vitamin D was explained through 
several mechanisms: ketone bodies, macronutrient intake, the status levels of 
other fat-soluble vitamins, weight loss, changes in the hormonal milieu, and 
effects on gut microbiota. Moreover, potential nutrient-gene-related 
interactions were discussed. There is still a need to conduct multiple arm 
studies to compare the effects of the KD versus other diets and better decipher 
the particular effects of the KD on vitamin D levels and metabolism. Moreover, 
differentiations of the diet's effects according to sex and genetic makeup 
should be investigated to prescribe KDs on a more personalized basis."
1142,"Angiotensinogen (AGT) is one of the most significant enzymes of the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) which is involved in the regulation 
and maintenance of blood pressure. AGT is involved in the production of 
angiotensin I which is then converted into angiotensin II that leads to renal 
homeostasis. However, various genetic polymorphisms in AGT have been discovered 
in recent times which have shown an association with various diseases. Genetic 
polymorphism increases the level of circulating AGT in blood which exaggerates 
the effects produced by AGT. The associated diseases occur due to various 
effects produced by increased AGT levels. Several cardiovascular diseases 
including myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, heart failure, 
hypertrophy, etc. are associated with AGT polymorphism. Other diseases such as 
depression, obesity, diabetic nephropathy, pre-eclampsia, and liver injury are 
also associated with some variants of AGT gene. The most common variants of AGT 
polymorphism are M235T and T174M. The two variants are associated with many 
diseases. Some other variants such as G-217A, A-6G, A-20C and G-152A, are also 
present but they are not as significant as that of M235T and T174M variants. 
These variants increase the level of circulating AGT and are associated with 
prevalence of different diseases. These diseases occur through various 
pathological pathways, but the initial reason remains the same, i.e., increased 
level of AGT in the blood. In this article, we have majorly focused on how 
genetic polymorphism of different variants of AGT gene is associated with the 
prevalence of different diseases."
1143,"Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments that can impart various colors to 
plants. Purple shamrock (Oxalis triangularis) possesses unique ornamental value 
due to its purple leaves. In this study, three anthocyanins, including malvidin 
3-O-(4-O-(6-O-malonyl-glucopyranoside)-rhamnopyranosyl)-5-O-(6-O-malonyl-glucopyranoside), 
delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside and malvidin-3,5-di-O-glucoside, were characterized 
with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass 
spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) in purple shamrock. To investigate the molecular 
mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis in green shamrock (Oxalis corymbosa) and 
purple shamrock, RNA-seq and qRT-PCR were performed, and the results showed that 
most of the anthocyanin biosynthetic and regulatory genes were up-regulated in 
purple shamrock. Then, dark treatment and low temperature treatment experiments 
in purple shamrock showed that both light and low temperature can induce the 
biosynthesis of anthocyanins."
1144,"To assess the efficacy of different modalities and frequencies of physical 
exercise on glycaemic control in adults with prediabetes. A two-phase, parallel, 
randomised, controlled clinical trial will be carried out, in 210 participants. 
In phase 1, 120 participants will be randomized into four arms: (1) aerobic 
exercise, (2) aerobic exercise combined with resistance, (3) high-intensity 
intervallic exercise and (4) control group. In phase 2, 90 new participants will 
be randomized into three arms, using the exercise modality that showed the best 
glycaemic control in phase 1 in the following manner: (1) frequency of 5 
days/week, (2) frequency of 3 days/week and (3) frequency of 2 days/week. The 
control group (n = 30) will be included in phase 1 to evaluate the effect of any 
type of intervention versus no intervention. Data collection will be performed 
at baseline and after 15 weeks of follow up. Sociodemographic data, medication, 
comorbidity, blood biochemical parameters, blood pressure, anthropometric 
measurements, body composition, physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, diet, 
smoking, alcohol consumption, quality of life and sleep questionnaires will be 
collected. Physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep will be further 
determined with an accelerometer, and continuous glycaemia will be determined 
with a glycaemic monitor, both during seven days, at two time points. The main 
dependent variable will be the reduction in the mean amplitude of glycaemic 
excursions. The impact of these interventions on health will also be evaluated 
through gene expression analysis in peripheral blood cells. The results of this 
study will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the 
glucose response to physical exercise in a population with prediabetes as well 
as improve physical exercise prescriptions for diabetes prevention. Increasing 
glycaemic control in people with prediabetes through physical exercise offers an 
opportunity to prevent diabetes and reduce associated comorbidities and health 
costs."
1145,"The present perspective article proposes that cachexia, muscle wasting in 
cancer, is mediated by dysregulated phosphate metabolism and phosphate toxicity 
that can damage tissues in most major organ systems. A diet high in phosphorus 
fed to mice deficient in klotho, a cofactor that regulates phosphate metabolism, 
accelerates aging, sarcopenia, general organ atrophy, kyphosis, and 
osteoporosis. Similar effects are seen in phenotypes of mutant p53 mice that 
overexpress the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Although mutant p53 mice do not 
develop tumors compared to wild-type mice, mutant p53 mice have shorter mean 
lifespans. Furthermore, tumorigenesis is associated with the sequestration of 
excessive inorganic phosphate, and dangerous levels of phosphate are released 
into circulation during tumor lysis syndrome. In total, this evidence implies 
that tumorigenesis may be a compensatory mechanism that provides protective 
effects against systemic exposure to dysregulated phosphate metabolism and 
phosphate toxicity related to cachexia in cancer. Moreover, the hypothetical 
protection against phosphate toxicity afforded by tumorigenesis also provides an 
alternate explanation for putative tumor evasion of the immune system. Insights 
proposed in this perspective paper provide new directions for further research, 
with potential to develop novel interventions and clinical applications that 
modify dietary phosphate intake to reduce cachexia in cancer patients."
1146,"Hyperlipidemia is a chronic disease that seriously affects human health. Due to 
the fact that traditional animal models cannot fully mimic hyperlipidemia in 
humans, new animal models are urgently needed for basic drug research on 
hyperlipidemia. Previous studies have demonstrated that the genomic diversity of 
the wild mice chromosome 1 substitution lines was significantly different from 
that of laboratory mice, suggesting that it might be accompanied by phenotypic 
diversity. We first screened the blood lipid-related phenotype of chromosome 1 
substitution lines. We found that the male HFD-fed B6-Chr1BLD mice showed more 
severe hyperlipidemia-related phenotypes in body weight, lipid metabolism and 
liver lesions. By RNA sequencing and whole-genome sequencing results of 
B6-Chr1BLD, we found that several differentially expressed single nucleotide 
polymorphism enriched genes were associated with lipid metabolism-related 
pathways. Lipid metabolism-related genes, mainly including Aida, Soat1, Scly and 
Ildr2, might play an initial and upstream role in the abnormal metabolic 
phenotype of male B6-Chr1BLD mice. Taken together, male B6-Chr1BLD mice could 
serve as a novel, polygenic interaction-based hyperlipidemia model. This study 
could provide a novel animal model for accurate clinical diagnosis and precise 
medicine of hyperlipidemia."
1147,"Groupers with an initial body weight of 9.10 ± 0.03 g were selected to 
investigate whether dietary addition of 0 (G0) and 1800 mg/kg glycerol 
monolaurate (GML, G1800) could alleviate the oxidative stress response and 
intestinal flora imbalance after 0, 6, 12, and 24 h of salinity change in 
grouper. Experimental results show that the dietary addition of GML 
significantly reduced the liver MDA content and increased the SOD activity of 
grouper. The gene expression of CAT and SOD increased and then decreased with 
time after adding 1800 mg/kg GML, and the highest values were significantly 
higher than those of the control group. Salinity change had a slight effect on 
the top four intestinal flora composition of grouper at 0, 12, and 24 h, with 
changes occurring only at 6 h when Cyanobacteria replaced Actinobacteria. The 
addition of dietary GML slowed down the intestinal flora disorder, inhibited the 
colonization of harmful bacterium Vibrio, and promoted the abundance of 
beneficial bacterium Bacillus. In conclusion, dietary GML significantly reduced 
the oxidative damage caused by sudden changes in salinity, improved the 
antioxidant capacity, and alleviated the intestinal flora imbalance in juvenile 
grouper."
1148,"Sugar metabolism influences the quality of sweet corn (Zea mays var. saccharate 
Sturt) kernels, which is a major goal for maize breeding. In this study, the 
genome-wide transcriptomes from two supersweet corn cultivars (cv. Xuetian 7401 
and Zhetian 11) with a nearly two-fold difference in kernel sugar content were 
carried out to explore the genes related to kernel sugar metabolism. In total, 
45,748 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in kernels and 596 DEGs in leaves 
were identified. PsbS, photosynthetic system II subunit S, showed two isoforms 
with different expression levels in leaf tissue between two cultivars, 
indicating that this gene might influence sugar accumulation in the kernel. On 
the other hand, hexokinases and beta-glucosidase genes involved in glycolysis, 
starch and sucrose metabolism were found in developing kernels with a 
genome-wide transcriptome analysis of developing kernels, which might contribute 
to the overaccumulation of water-soluble polysaccharides and an increase in the 
sweetness in the kernels of Xuetian 7401. These results indicated that kernel 
sugar accumulation in sweet corn might be influenced by both photosynthesis 
efficiency and the sugar metabolism rate. Our study supplied a new insight for 
breeding new cultivars with high sugar content and laid the foundation for 
exploring the regulatory mechanisms of kernel sugar content in corn."
1149,"A Western-style diet that is high in fat and sucrose has been shown to alter DNA 
methylation and epigenetically modify genes related to health risk in offspring. 
Here, we investigated the effect of a methyl-donor nutrient (MS) supplemented to 
a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFS) diet during pregnancy and lactation on vitamin D 
(VD) status and inflammatory response in offspring. After mating, 10-week-old 
female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (n = 10/group) were randomly assigned to one of 
the four dietary groups during pregnancy and lactation: (1) control diet (CON), 
(2) CON with MS (CON-MS), (3) HFS, and (4) HFS with MS (HFS-MS). Weanling 
offspring (three weeks old) were euthanized and sacrificed (n = 8-10/sex/group). 
The remaining offspring (n = 10/sex/group) were randomly assigned to either a 
CON or an HFS diet for 12 weeks and sacrificed at 15 weeks of age. Our results 
indicated that prenatal MS supplementation, but not postnatal diet, restored low 
vitamin D status and suppressed elevation of proinflammatory cytokine induced by 
maternal HFS in the offspring. Furthermore, both prenatal and postnatal diets 
modulated the abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and Bacteroides spp. in the 
offspring, a shift that was independent of vitamin D status. Collectively, our 
data support a role for MS in restoring the perturbation of VD status and 
normalizing maternal HFS-induced inflammation in the offspring. Further 
investigation is warranted to elucidate the methylation status of VD 
metabolism-related pathways in the offspring, as well as the immunomodulatory 
role of vitamin D during the progression of obesity."
1150,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR), as the leading cause of vision loss in the 
working-age population, exhibits unique metabolite profiles in human plasma and 
vitreous. However, those in retina are not fully understood. Here, we utilized 
liquid and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technology to explore 
metabolite characteristics of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice retina. 
A total of 145 metabolites differed significantly in diabetic retinas compared 
with controls. These metabolites are mainly enriched in the Warburg effect, and 
valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathways. To further identify 
underlying regulators, RNA sequencing was performed to integrate metabolic 
enzyme alterations with metabolomics in STZ-induced diabetic retina. Retinol 
metabolism and tryptophan metabolism are the shared pathways enriched by 
metabolome and transcriptome. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis identified 
71 differentially expressed enzyme-related genes including Hk2, Slc7a5, Aldh1a3 
and Tph integrated with altered metabolic pathways. In addition, single 
nucleotide polymorphisms within 6 out of 71 genes are associated with increased 
diabetes risk. This study lays the foundation for mechanism research and the 
therapeutic target development of DR."
1151,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver 
diseases, along with steatosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and is 
associated with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Candidate gene and 
genome-wide association studies have validated the relationships between NAFLD, 
NASH, PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and HFE. The present study utilized five polymorphisms in 
three genes: PNPLA3 (I148M and K434E) TM6SF2 (E167K), and HFE (H63D and C282Y), 
based on undocumented case-control studies in the Saudi Arabian population. A 
total of 95 patients with NAFLD and 78 non-NAFLD subjects were recruited. 
Genomic DNA was isolated, and polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing 
were performed using specific primers for the I148M, K434E, E167K, H63D, and 
C282Y. NAFLD subjects were older when compared to controls and showed the 
significant association (p = 0.0001). Non-significant association was found 
between gender (p = 0.26). However, both weight and BMI were found to be 
associated. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis confirmed that H63D, I148M, and 
K434E polymorphisms were associated. Genotype analysis showed only K434E variant 
was associated with NAFLD and non-NAFLD (OR-2.16; 95% CI: 1.08-4.31; p = 0.02). 
However, other polymorphisms performed with NAFLD and NASH were not associated 
(p &gt; 0.05), and similar analysis was found when ANOVA was performed (p &gt; 
0.05). In conclusion, we confirmed that K434E polymorphism showed a positive 
association in the Saudi population."
1152,"Endophytic bacteria boost host plant defense and growth by producing vital 
compounds. In the current study, a bacterial strain was isolated from the 
Boswellia sacra plant and identified as Bacillus subtilis strain EP1 (accession 
number: MT256301) through 16S RNA gene sequencing. From the identified bacteria, 
four compounds-1 (4-(4-cinnamoyloxy)phenyl)butanoic acid), 2 
(cyclo-(L-Pro-D-Tyr)), 3 (cyclo-(L-Val-L-Phe)), and 4 (cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Val))-were 
isolated and characterized by 1D and 2D NMR and mass spectroscopy. Moreover, 
antibacterial activity and beta-lactam-producing gene inhibition 
(δ-(l-α-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine synthetase (ACVS) and aminoadipate 
aminotransferase (AADAT)) assays were performed. Significant antibacterial 
activity was observed against the human pathogenic bacterial strains (E. coli) 
by compound 4 with a 13 ± 0.7 mm zone of inhibition (ZOI), followed by compound 
1 having an 11 ± 0.7 mm ZOI. In contrast, the least antibacterial activity among 
the tested samples was offered by compound 2 with a 10 ± 0.9 mm ZOI compared to 
the standard (26 ± 1.2 mm). Similarly, the molecular analysis of beta-lactam 
inhibition determined that compounds 3 and 4 inhibited the two genes (2- to 
4-fold) in the beta-lactam biosynthesis (ACVS and AADAT) pathway. From these 
results, it can be concluded that future research on these compounds could lead 
to the inhibition of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacterial strains."
1153,"Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is safe and tolerated in 
neurodegeneration, it achieves CSF concentration that is adequate to inhibit 
discoidin domain receptor (DDR)-1. Nilotinib significantly affects dopamine 
metabolites, including Homovanillic acid (HVA), resulting in an increase in 
brain dopamine. HD is a hereditary disease caused by mutations in the 
Huntingtin's (HTT) gene and characterized by neurodegeneration and motor and 
behavioral symptoms that are associated with activation of dopamine receptors. 
We explored the effects of a low dose of nilotinib (150 mg) on behavioral 
changes and motor symptoms in manifest HD patients and examined the effects of 
nilotinib on several brain mechanisms, including dopamine transmission and gene 
expression via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) miRNA sequencing. Nilotinib, 150 mg, 
did not result in any behavioral changes, although it significantly attenuated 
HVA levels, suggesting reduction of dopamine catabolism. There was no 
significant change in HTT, phosphorylated neuro-filament and inflammatory 
markers in the CSF and plasma via immunoassays. Whole miRNA genome sequencing of 
the CSF revealed significant longitudinal changes in miRNAs that control 
specific genes associated with autophagy, inflammation, microglial activity and 
basal ganglia neurotransmitters, including dopamine and serotonin."
1154,"Freezing damage is a common phenomenon responsible for reduced yields of 
economic crops. Regulation of lipid metabolism plays an important role in plant 
growth and adaptation during freezing. We previously carried out transcriptome 
and untargeted metabolome analyses to determine the regulation of flavonol and 
anthocyanin biosynthesis during freezing treatment (FT) and post-freezing 
recovery (FR) in Dendrobium&amp;nbsp;catenatum. However, changes in lipid levels 
are hard to confirm by untargeted metabolomics analysis alone. Regulation of 
lipid metabolism in response to freezing is largely unknown in Dendrobium. In 
this study, a multi-omics strategy was used to offer a better means of studying 
metabolic flow during FT and FR. To this end, 6976 proteins were identified by 
the 4D_label-free proteome, including 5343 quantified proteins. For each of the 
two conditions, we enriched differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) into 15 
gene ontology (GO) terms, including primary metabolism, lipid metabolism, and 
photosynthesis processes. We also identified 7 lipid categories and 3672 lipid 
species using lipidome assays. We found significant remodeling occurring in the 
phospholipid category during FT and FR. We also found that most sphingolipids 
were significantly upregulated. An integrated multi-omics analysis revealed 
significant changes in the expression levels of 141 mRNAs and encoding proteins 
under both FT and FR conditions. During FT, phospholipase A (PLA) and 
phospholipase D (PLD) were associated with phospholipid editing and galactolipid 
remodeling. These results provide valuable new insights into how the freezing 
tolerance of D. catenatum might be improved by genetic engineering."
1155,"Cytotoxicity of de novo purine synthesis (DNPS) metabolites is critical to the 
pathogenesis of three known and one putative autosomal recessive disorder 
affecting DNPS. These rare disorders are caused by biallelic mutations in the 
DNPS genes phosphoribosylformylglycineamidine synthase (PFAS), 
phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxylase/phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide 
synthase (PAICS), adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), and aminoimidazole carboxamide 
ribonucleotide transformylase/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (ATIC) and 
are clinically characterized by developmental abnormalities, psychomotor 
retardation, and nonspecific neurological impairment. At a biochemical level, 
loss of function of specific mutated enzymes results in elevated levels of DNPS 
ribosides in body fluids. The main pathogenic effect is attributed to the 
accumulation of DNPS ribosides, which are postulated to be toxic to the 
organism. Therefore, we decided to characterize the uptake and flux of several 
DNPS metabolites in HeLa cells and the impact of DNPS metabolites to viability 
of cancer cell lines and primary skin fibroblasts. We treated cells with DNPS 
metabolites and followed their flux in purine synthesis and degradation. In this 
study, we show for the first time the transport of formylglycinamide ribotide 
(FGAR), aminoimidazole ribotide (AIR), succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide 
ribotide (SAICAR), and aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribotide (AICAR) into cells and 
their flux in DNPS and the degradation pathway. We found diminished cell 
viability mostly in the presence of FGAR and AIR. Our results suggest that 
direct cellular toxicity of DNPS metabolites may not be the primary pathogenetic 
mechanism in these disorders."
1156,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients receiving dolutegravir, 
a known inhibitor of the renal and neuronal-expressed organic anion transporter 
2 (encoded by SLC22A2 gene). The effect of the genetic variant SLC22A2 808C&gt;A 
on dolutegravir discontinuation was assessed and analyzed by real-time PCR. We 
enrolled 627 participants: CA/AA carriers showed a higher prevalence of 
pre-existing psychiatric comorbidities and use of antidepressants. After 27.9 
months, 108 participants discontinued dolutegravir, 64 for neuropsychiatric 
symptoms. Patients with pre-existing psychiatric comorbidities were at higher 
risk of dolutegravir discontinuation, while patients carrying the SLC22A2 CA/AA 
genotype were not. Combining the two variables, an opposite effect of SLC22A2 
variants according to pre-existing psychiatric disorders was observed. Using 
multivariate Cox models, the combined variable pre-existing psychiatric 
comorbidities/SLC22A2 variants and the use of non-tenofovir alafenamide 
containing antiretroviral regimens were predictors of dolutegravir 
discontinuation for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Within 30 days, the majority of 
participants had a complete resolution of symptoms (61.8%), while 32.7% and 5.5% 
had partial or no change after dolutegravir discontinuation, respectively. 
Discontinuation of dolutegravir for neuropsychiatric symptoms was not uncommon 
and more frequent in participants with pre-existing psychiatric disorders. We 
described an interaction between SLC22A2 genetic variant and psychiatric 
comorbidities. In 38.2% of patients, a complete neuropsychiatric symptoms 
resolution was not observed after dolutegravir discontinuation suggesting the 
involvement of additional factors."
1157,"This study aimed to evaluate whether the single nucleotide polymorphisms of 
ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) and solute carrier family 2 
member 9 (SLC2A9) affect individual blood uric acid levels using pyrosequencing. 
ABCG2 (rs2231142, rs72552713, rs2231137), SLC2A9 (rs3734553, rs3733591, 
rs16890979), and individual uric acid levels were prospectively analyzed in 250 
healthy young Korean male participants. Prominent differences in uric acid 
levels of the alleles were observed in the SLC2A9 rs3733591 polymorphism: 
wild-type (AA) vs. heterozygote (AG), 0.7 mg/dL (p &lt; 0.0001); AA vs. mutant 
type (GG), 1.32 mg/dL (p &lt; 0.0001); and AG vs. GG, 0.62 mg/dL (p &lt; 0.01). 
In ABCG2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the statistically significant 
differences in uric acid levels were only found in rs2231142 between CC vs. AA 
(1.06 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.001), and CC vs. CA (0.59 mg/dL; p &lt; 0.01). Serum uric 
acid levels based on the ABCG2 and SLC2A9 diplotype groups were also compared. 
The uric acid levels were the lowest in the CC/AA diplotype and highest in the 
AA/AG diplotype. In addition, the SNP SLC2A9 rs3733591 tended to increase the 
uric acid levels when the ABCG2 rs2231142 haplotypes were fixed. In conclusion, 
both the ABCG2 rs2231142 and SLC2A9 rs3733591 polymorphisms may additively 
elevate blood uric acid levels."
1158,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine-metabolic disorder of unknown 
etiology. Hyperandrogenism (HA) is the main diagnostic criteria for PCOS, in 
addition to being a risk factor for developing several disorders throughout the 
patient's life, including pregnancy. However, the impact on offspring is little 
known. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of maternal HA 
on glucose metabolism and hepatic lipid accumulation in adult offspring. We used 
Balb/c mice treated with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for 20 consecutive days. 
The ovary of DHEA-treated mice showed hemorrhagic bodies, an increased number of 
atretic follicles, and greater expression of genes related to meiotic cell cycle 
and DNA repair. The DHEA offspring (O-DHEA) had low birth weight, and some pups 
showed malformations. However, O-DHEA individuals gained weight rapidly, and the 
differences between them and the control group became significantly greater in 
adulthood. Moreover, O-DHEA presented higher serum glucose after a 6 h fast and 
a larger area under glucose, insulin, and pyruvate tolerance test curves. Oil 
Red O staining showed a more significant accumulation of fat in the liver but no 
changes in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels. In summary, our results 
show that HA, induced by DHEA, affects gene expression in oocyte, which in turn 
generates defects in embryonic development, insulin resistance, and alteration 
in hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism in O-DHEA, thereby increasing 
the risk of developing metabolic diseases."
1159,"In recent years, the perspective towards the use of cannabis has slowly shifted 
from being an illicit drug to a medicinal plant. The pathway and enzymes 
involved in the production of cannabinoids are known; however, studies 
evaluating the production of cannabinoids in heterologous plants and cell 
cultures are still limited. In this study, we assessed the potential use of N. 
benthamiana (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants as a heterologous host for producing 
natural and novel cannabinoids. Transgenic N. benthamiana plants expressing 
genes encoding cannabis acyl-activating enzyme and olivetol synthase were 
generated, which were then used for transiently expressing other downstream 
pathway genes. Production of olivetolic acid and divarinic acid, the universal 
precursors for major and minor cannabinoids, respectively, was observed in 
transgenic N. benthamiana plants. To produce novel cannabinoid precursors with 
different side chains, various fatty acids were infiltrated into the transgenic 
N. benthamiana plants and the production of novel derivatives was observed. 
Although we were not able to derive the core intermediate, cannabigerolic acid, 
from our transgenic plants, possibly due to the low production levels of the 
precursors, our transgenics plants still serve as a high-potential platform for 
further development and exploring the N. benthamiana chemical space for 
generating novel cannabinoids."
1160,"LC-HRESIMS metabolomic profiling of Olea europaea L. cv. Picual (OEP) (Saudi 
Arabian olive cultivar, F. Oleacea) revealed 18 compounds. Using pharmacology 
networking to specify the targets of the identified compounds with a 
relationship to Alzheimer's disease, it was possible to identify the VEGFA, 
AChE, and DRD2 genes as the top correlated genes to Alzheimer's disease with 8, 
8, and 6 interactions in the same order. The mechanism of action on cellular 
components, biological processes, and molecular functions was determined by gene 
enrichment analysis. A biological pathway comparison revealed 13 shared pathways 
between the identified genes and Alzheimer protein genes (beta-amyloid band tau 
proteins). The suggested extract's anti-Alzheimer potential in silico screening 
was confirmed through in vivo investigation in regressing the neurodegenerative 
features of Alzheimer's dementia in an aluminum-intoxicated rat model 
(protective and therapeutic effects, 100 mg/kg b.w.). In vivo results suggested 
that OEP extract significantly improved Alzheimer's rats, which was indicated by 
the crude extract's ability to improve T-maze performance; lower elevated serum 
levels of AChE, AB peptide, and Ph/T ratio; and normalize the reduced level of 
TAC during the study. The results presented in this study may provide potential 
dietary supplements for the management of Alzheimer's disease."
1161,"Chrysomycin A (CA), a promising antibiotic agent, usually coexists with two 
analog chrysomycins B (CB) and C (CC) produced by several wild-type (WT) 
Streptomyces strains. With the aim to increase CA production, UV 
mutagenesis-based breeding had been employed on a marine-derived strain 
Streptomyces sp. 891 in our previous study and afforded an improved strain 
891-B6 with enhanced CA yield. By comparative transcriptome analysis, 
significant differences in chrysomycin BGC-related gene expression between the 
WT strain 891 and the mutant strain 891-B6 were unveiled in the current study. 
Among 25 up-regulated genes in mutant 891-B6, chryA, chryB, chryC, chryF, chryG, 
chryK, chryP, and chryQ, responsible for the biosynthesis of 
benzonaphthopyranone aglycone, and chryD, chryE, and chryU in charge of 
production of its deoxyglycoside, were characterized. Furthermore, the 
expression of genes chryOII, chryOIII, and chryOIV responsible for the formation 
of 8-vinyl in CA from 8-ethyl in CB were greatly enhanced in strain 891-B6. 
These findings provide molecular mechanisms for increased yield of CA and 
decreased yield of CB for mutant 891-B6, which has potential application in 
industrial CA production."
1162,"Flavonoids are bioactive secondary metabolites that play multiple roles in 
plants. However, studies on the flavonoid accumulation of the pomelo fruit are 
rare. In this study, we conducted a widely targeted metabolome analysis by using 
ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry and 
identified 550 metabolites in the sarcocarp from red (C.&amp;nbsp;maxima Merr. 
var. Tubtim Siam) and white pomelos (C. maxima (Burm.) Osbeck). A total of 263 
significantly changed metabolites were detected from the 550 metabolites. 
Content analysis of the significantly changed metabolites (SCMs) showed that 138 
SCMs were highly accumulated, whereas 125 SCMs were observed with lower content 
in red-sarcocarp pomelo. Importantly, 103 of the 263 SCMs were flavonoids, 
including 34 flavonoids, 29 flavonols, 18 flavonoid carbonosides, 9 
dihydroflavones, 6 isoflavones, 5 anthocyanins, 1 dihydroflavonol, and 1 
chalcone. Gene ontology analysis indicated that upregulated genes in 
red-sarcocarp pomelo were significantly enriched in GO terms related to 
flavonoids including flavonoid biosynthetic processes. Several important 
differentially expressed genes were detected in the correlation network, 
especially Cg2g009540 which is an orthologous gene of AtCHS, also detected in 
flavonoid biosynthesis networks, and which could be related to the high level of 
total flavonoids in the red-sarcocarp pomelo. Our study demonstrated the 
fluctuation of flavonoid biosynthesis in the two pomelo cultivars and laid a 
theoretical foundation for pomelo breeding to generate fruits with a high 
flavonoid content."
1163,"Organic-anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), encoded by the solute 
carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 gene (SLCO1B1), is highly 
expressed in the liver and transports several endogenous metabolites into the 
liver, including statins. Previous studies have not investigated the association 
of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 variant with the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) or 
determined the metabolite signature of the C allele of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 
(SLCO1B1 rs4149056-C allele) in a large randomly selected population. SLCO1B1 
rs4149056-C inhibits OATP1B1 transporter and is associated with increased levels 
of blood simvastatin concentrations. Our study is to first to show that SLCO1B1 
rs4149056 variant is not significantly associated with the risk of T2D, 
suggesting that simvastatin has a direct effect on the risk of T2D. 
Additionally, we investigated the effects of SLCO1B1 rs4149056-C on plasma 
metabolite concentrations in 1373 participants on simvastatin treatment and in 
1368 age- and body-mass index (BMI)-matched participants without any statin 
treatment. We found 31 novel metabolites significantly associated with SLCO1B1 
rs4149056-C in the participants on simvastatin treatment and in the participants 
without statin treatment. Simvastatin decreased concentrations of dicarboxylic 
acids, such as docosadioate and dodecanedioate, that may increase beta- and 
peroxisomal oxidation and increased the turnover of cholesterol into bile acids, 
resulting in a decrease in steroidogenesis due to limited availability of 
cholesterol for steroid synthesis. Our findings suggest that simvastatin exerts 
its effects on the lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 
concentrations through several distinct pathways in the carriers of SLCO1B1 
rs4149056-C, including dicarboxylic acids, bile acids, steroids, and 
glycerophospholipids."
1164,"The membranes of plant cells are dynamic structures composed of phospholipids 
and proteins. Proteins harboring phospholipid-binding domains or lipid ligands 
can localize to membranes. Stress perception can alter the subcellular 
localization of these proteins dynamically, causing them to either associate 
with or detach from membranes. The mechanisms behind the re-localization involve 
changes in the lipidation state of the proteins and interactions with 
membrane-associated biomolecules. The functional significance of such 
re-localization includes the regulation of molecular transport, cell integrity, 
protein folding, signaling, and gene expression. In this review, proteins that 
re-localize to or away from membranes upon abiotic and biotic stresses will be 
discussed in terms of the mechanisms involved and the functional significance of 
their re-localization. Knowledge of the re-localization mechanisms will 
facilitate research on increasing plant stress adaptability, while the study on 
re-localization of proteins upon stresses will further our understanding of 
stress adaptation strategies in plants."
1165,"Extracellular vesicles (EV) are membrane vesicles surrounded by a lipid bilayer 
membrane and include microvesicles, apoptotic bodies, exosomes, and exomeres. 
Exosome-encapsulated microRNAs (miRNAs) released from cancer cells are involved 
in the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells via angiogenesis. On the 
other hand, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, which is being employed in 
regenerative medicine owing to the ability of MSCs to differentiate into various 
cells, is due to humoral factors, including messenger RNA (mRNA), miRNAs, 
proteins, and lipids, which are encapsulated in exosomes derived from 
transplanted cells. New treatments that advocate cell-free therapy using 
MSC-derived exosomes will significantly improve clinical practice. Therefore, 
using highly purified exosomes that perform their original functions is 
desirable. In this review, we summarized advances in the purification, 
modification, and application of EVs as novel strategies to treat some diseases."
1166,"Background: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive and rare 
malignant pleural tumor. Methods: MPM patients diagnosed in Beijing Chaoyang 
Hospital and Beijing Tongren Hospital were the focus of this study. We collected 
and analyzed the histological, radiological, and metabolic features of MPM 
patients. At the same time, Cox univariable and multivariable analyses were used 
to explore the laboratory risk factors affecting the prognosis of MPM patients. 
Results: A total of 129 MPM patients were included in this study. MPM includes 
three main histological subtypes: epithelioid, sarcomatoid and biphasic. Among 
them, epithelial subtypes accounted for the highest proportion. Calretinin, 
Wilms' tumor gene (WT1), cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), and D2-40 were the most useful 
mesothelial markers to support a MPM diagnosis. The imaging features of MPM 
patients are pleural thickening and pleural effusion. In PET-CT, the affected 
pleura showed obvious high uptake of tracer, and the degree was related to the 
specific subtype. The median follow-up time was 55.0 (30.0, 94.0) months. A 
total of 92 (71.3%) patients died during follow-up. The median survival time of 
patients was 21.0 (9.0, 48.0) months. The Cox multivariable analysis showed that 
age [hazard ratio (HR), 1.824; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.159-2.872; p = 
0.009; uncorrected], ESR (HR, 2.197; 95% CI 1.318-3.664; p = 0.003; with 
Bonferroni correction), lymphocytes (HR, 0.436; 95% CI 0.258-0.737; p = 0.002; 
with Bonferroni correction), platelets (HR, 1.802; 95% CI 1.084-2.997; p = 
0.023; uncorrected) and total protein (HR, 0.625; 95% CI 0.394-0.990; p = 0.045; 
uncorrected) were independent risk factors for prognosis, after adjusting for 
confounding factors. Conclusions: Age, ESR, lymphocytes, platelets and total 
protein may be related to the prognosis of MPM patients. Summarizing the 
histological, radiological, and metabolic features of MPM patients in the two 
centers can increase clinicians' understanding of this rare tumor."
1167,"Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is one of the most common 
hereditary heart diseases. The severely hypertrophied interventricular septum 
combined with the systolic anterior movement (SAM) of the mitral valve (MV) 
frequently cause a significant pressure gradient in the left ventricular outflow 
tract associated with varying degrees of mitral regurgitation (MR). We present 
the case of a 64-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with HOCM two years 
ago and was admitted to the Institute of Cardiovascular Disease with exertion 
dyspnea and fatigue. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed concentric, 
asymmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy, an elongated anterior mitral leaflet 
(AML) and a significant SAM causing severe regurgitation, with indication for 
valvular replacement Monoamine oxidase (MAO), a mitochondrial enzyme, with 2 
isoforms, MAO-A and B, has emerged as an important source of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) in the cardiovascular system, but literature data on its 
expression in valvular tissue is scarce. Therefore, we assessed MAO-A and B gene 
(qPCR) and protein (immune fluorescence) expression as well as ROS production 
(spectrophotometry and confocal microscopy) and in the explanted MV harvested 
during replacement surgery. MAO expression and ROS production (assessed by both 
methods) were further augmented following ex vivo incubation with angiotensin 
II, an effect that was reversed in the presence of either MAO-A (clorgyline) or 
B (selegiline) inhibitor, respectively. In conclusion, MAO isoforms are 
expressed at the level of severely impaired mitral valve in the setting of HOCM 
and can be induced in conditions that mimic the activation of 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The observation that the enzyme can be 
modulated by MAO inhibitors warrants further investigation in a patient cohort."
1168,"Background and Objective: Translational large animal models are inevitable to 
transfer cartilage repair methods into clinical practice. Guidelines for these 
trials have been published by guiding agencies (FDA, ASTM, EMEA) including 
recommendations for study descriptors and study outcomes. However, practical 
adherence to these recommendations is not achieved in all aspects. This study 
includes an assessment of the recommended aspects regarding practical relevance 
in large animal models for cartilage repair by professionals in the field. 
Materials and Methods: In an online based survey, 11 aspects regarding study 
design and 13 aspects regarding study outcome from previously published 
guidelines were evaluated (0-10 points, with 10 being most important) by study 
participants. Additionally, the survey contained questions related to 
professional experience (years), professional focus (preclinical, clinical, 
veterinarian, industry) and the preferred translational large animal model for 
cartilage repair. Results: The total number of survey participants was 37. Rated 
as most important for study design parameters was lesion size (9.54 pts., SD 
0.80) followed by study duration (9.43 pts., SD 1.21); and method of scaffold 
fixation (9.08 pts., SD 1.30) as well as depth of the lesion (9.03 pts., SD 
1.77). The most important aspects of study outcome were considered histology 
(9.41 pts., SD 0.86) and defect filling (8.97 pts., SD 1.21), while gene 
expression was judged as the least important (6.11 pts., SD 2.46) outcome. A 
total of 62.2% of all participants were researchers, 18.9% clinicians, 13.5% 
veterinarians and 5.4% industry employees. Conclusions: In translational 
research, recommendations published by guiding agencies receive broad 
theoretical consensus within the community, including both clinically and 
preclinically orientated scientists. However, implementation into practical 
research lacks in major aspects. Ongoing re-evaluation of the guidelines under 
involvement of all stakeholders and approaches to overcome financial and 
infrastructural limitations could support the acceptance of the guidance 
documents and contribute to standardization in the field."
1169,"Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a hereditary cancer syndrome 
characterized by multiple café-au-lait macules on the skin. Lymphoproliferative 
malignancies associated with NF1 are limited, although the most common are brain 
tumors. Case presentation: A 22-year-old woman with NF1 was admitted due to 
abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Her laboratory data exhibited macrocytic 
anemia and elevated IgA levels. Image studies showed diffuse increased wall 
thickening in the transverse and descending colon without lymphadenopathy and 
hepatosplenomegaly. A colonoscopy revealed a hemorrhagic ulcerated mass. 
Pathological analysis of the tumor tissues confirmed IgA-expressing 
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma with histological 
transformation. Moreover, whole-exome sequencing in tumor tissues and peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells identified a somatic frameshift mutation of the A20 
gene, which represents the loss of function. The patient responded well to 
R-CHOP chemotherapy, but the disease relapsed after 1 year, resulting in a 
lethal outcome. Conclusions: MALT lymphoma in children and young adults is 
extremely rare and is possibly caused by acquired genetic changes. This case 
suggests a novel association between hereditary cancer syndrome and early-onset 
MALT lymphoma."
1170,"Background and Objectives: Visceral obesity is associated with chronic low-grade 
inflammation that predisposes to metabolic syndrome. Indeed, infiltration of 
adipose tissue with immune-inflammatory cells, including 'classical' 
inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory 'alternative' M2 macrophages, causes the 
release of a variety of bioactive molecules, resulting in the metabolic 
complications of obesity. This study examined the relative expression of 
macrophage phenotypic surface markers, cholesterol efflux proteins, scavenger 
receptors, and adenosine receptors in human circulating peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), isolated from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM), with the aim to phenotypically characterize and identify biomarkers for 
these ill-defined cells. Materials and Methodology: PBMCs were isolated from 
four groups of adults: Normal-weight non-diabetic, obese non-diabetic, newly 
diagnosed with T2DM, and T2DM on metformin. The mRNA expression levels of 
macrophage phenotypic surface markers (interleukin-12 (IL-12), C-X-C motif 
chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), C-C motif chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17), and C-C 
motif receptor 7 (CCR7)), cholesterol efflux proteins (ATP-binding cassette 
transporter-1 (ABCA1), ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), and 
sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A)), scavenger receptors (scavenger receptor-A 
(SR-A), C-X-C motif ligand 16 (CXCL16), and lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 
(LOX-1)), and adenosine receptors (adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) and adenosine 
A3 receptor (A3R)) were measured using qRT-PCR. Results: In PBMCs from T2DM 
patients, the expression of IL-12, CCR7, ABCA1, and SR-A1 was increased, whereas 
the expression of CXCL10, CCL17, ABCG1,27-hydroxylase, LOX-1, A2AR and A3R was 
decreased. On the other hand, treatment with the antidiabetic drug, metformin, 
reduced the expression of IL-12 and increased the expression of 27-hydroxylase, 
LOX-1, CXCL16 and A2AR. Conclusions: PBMCs in the circulation of patients with 
T2DM express phenotypic markers that are different from those typically present 
in adipose tissue M1 and M2 macrophages and could be representative of 
metabolically activated macrophages (MMe)-like cells. Our findings suggest that 
metformin alters phenotypic markers of MMe-like cells in circulation."
1171,"Background: Reversion mutations in BRCA1/2, resulting in restoration of the open 
reading frame, have been identified as a mechanism of resistance to 
platinum-based chemotherapy or PARP inhibition. We sought to explore the 
incidence of BRCA1/2 reversion mutations in different tumor types. Methods: We 
retrospectively analyzed molecular profiling results from primary and/or 
metastatic tumor samples submitted by multiple institutions. The samples 
underwent DNA and RNA sequencing at a CLIA/CAP-certified clinical lab. Reversion 
mutations were called only in patients whose available clinical records showed 
the use of PARP inhibitors or platinum agents prior to tumor profiling. Results: 
Reversion mutations were identified in 75 of 247,926 samples profiled across all 
tumor types. Among patients carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic BRCA1/2 
mutations, reversion mutations in BRCA1/2 genes were seen in ovarian cancer (OC) 
(30/3424), breast cancer (BC) (27/1460), endometrial cancer (4/564), pancreatic 
cancer (2/340), cholangiocarcinoma (2/178), prostate cancer (5/461), cervical 
cancer (1/117), cancer of unknown primary (1/244), bladder cancer (1/300), 
malignant pleural mesothelioma (1/10), and a neuroendocrine tumor of the 
prostate. We identified 22 reversion mutations in BRCA1 and 8 in BRCA2 in OC. In 
BC, we detected 6 reversion mutations in BRCA1 and 21 in BRCA2. We compared 
molecular profile results of 14 high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) with 
reversion mutations against 87 control HGSOC with pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations 
without reversion mutations. Tumors with reversion mutations trended to have had 
lower ER expression (25% vs. 64%, p = 0.024, q = 0.82) and higher KDM6A mutation 
rate (15% vs. 0, p = 0.016, q = 0.82). Conclusions: We present one of the 
largest datasets reporting reversion mutations in BRCA1/2 genes across various 
tumor types. These reversion mutations were rare; this may be because some 
patients may not have had repeat profiling post-treatment. Repeat tumor 
profiling at times of treatment resistance can help inform therapy selection in 
the refractory disease setting."
1172,"Background and Objectives: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type 
of primary liver cancer, is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. It 
arises and progresses against fibrotic or cirrhotic backgrounds mainly due to 
infection with hepatitis viruses B (HBV) or C (HCV) or non-viral causes that 
lead to chronic inflammation and genomic changes. A better understanding of 
molecular and immune mechanisms in HCC subtypes is needed. Materials and 
Methods: To identify transcriptional changes in primary HCC tumors with or 
without hepatitis viral etiology, we analyzed the transcriptomes of 24 patients 
by next-generation sequencing. Results: We identified common and unique 
differentially expressed genes for each etiological tumor group and analyzed the 
expression of SLC, ATP binding cassette, cytochrome 450, cancer testis, and heat 
shock protein genes. Metascape functional enrichment analysis showed mainly 
upregulated cell-cycle pathways in HBV and HCV and upregulated cell response to 
stress in non-viral infection. GeneWalk analysis identified regulator, hub, and 
moonlighting genes and highlighted CCNB1, ACTN2, BRCA1, IGF1,&amp;nbsp;CDK1, 
AURKA, AURKB, and TOP2A in the HCV group and HSF1, HSPA1A, HSP90AA1, HSPB1, 
HSPA5, PTK2, and AURKB in the group without viral infection as hub genes. Immune 
infiltrate analysis showed that T cell, cytotoxic, and natural killer cell 
markers were significantly more highly expressed in HCV than in non-viral 
tumors. Genes associated with monocyte activation had the highest expression 
levels in HBV, while high expression of genes involved in primary adaptive 
immune response and complement receptor activity characterized tumors without 
viral infection. Conclusions: Our comprehensive study underlines the high degree 
of complexity of immune profiles in the analyzed groups, which adds to the 
heterogeneous HCC genomic landscape. The biomarkers identified in each HCC group 
might serve as therapeutic targets."
1173,"Background and Objectives: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a kidney disease where the 
patient has a classic triad of signs and symptoms including 
hypercholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria (&gt;3.5 g/24 h), and 
peripheral edema. In case of NS, the damaged nephrons (structural and functional 
unit of the kidney) filter unwanted blood contents to make urine. Thus, the 
urine contains unwanted proteins (proteinuria) and blood cells (hematuria), 
while the bloodstream lacks enough protein albumin (hypoalbuminemia). Nephrotic 
syndrome is divided into two types, primary NS, and secondary NS. Primary NS, 
also known as primary glomerulonephrosis, is the result of a glomerular disease 
that is limited to the kidney, while secondary NS is a condition that affects 
the kidney and other parts of the body. The main causes of primary NS are 
minimal change disease, membranous glomerulonephritis, and focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis. In the present study we recruited a family segregating 
primary NS with the aim to identify the underlying genetic etiology. Such type 
of study is important in children because it allows counseling of other family 
members who may be at risk of developing NS, predicts risk of recurrent disease 
phenotypes after kidney transplant, and predicts response to immunosuppressive 
therapy. Materials and Methods: All affected individuals were clinically 
evaluated. Clinical examination, results of laboratory tests, and biopsy 
investigations led us to the diagnosis. The next-generation sequencing technique 
(whole-exome sequencing) followed by Sanger sequencing identified a novel 
homozygous splice site variant (NM_173689.7: c.941-3C&gt;T) in the CRB2 gene. 
The variant was present in a homozygous state in the affected individuals, while 
in a heterozygous state in phenotypically normal parents. Results: The study 
expanded the spectrum of the mutations in the gene CRB2 responsible for causing 
NS. Conclusions: In addition, the study will also help in genetic counseling, 
carrier testing, and prenatal and/or postnatal early diagnosis of the disease in 
the affected family."
1174,"Background and Objectives: ZBTB48 is a telomere-related protein that has been 
renamed telomeric zinc finger-associated protein (TZAP). It favorably binds to 
elongated telomeres to regulate their appropriate length. However, TZAP 
expression has not been investigated in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). 
Materials and Methods: The clinical significance of TZAP expression in 72 HCC 
was investigated. Additionally, its findings were supported by open big data and 
cancer cell lines. Results: TZAP expression level was not associated with the 
clinical parameters of HCC. TZAP expression induced a poorer survival result 
(overall survival, p = 0.020; disease-free survival, p = 0.012). TCGA data 
showed TZAP expression was more frequently found in HCCs with hepatitis C 
infection (p = 0.023). However, TCGA data revealed that TZAP expression did not 
predict HCC prognosis. In a cell line study, TZAP inhibition via siRNA 
suppressed PLC/PRF/5 cell growth; however, cell viability was increased in HepG2 
cells. Conclusions: We presented the clinical and prognostic values of TZAP 
expression in HCC tissues and cancer cell lines. Additionally, the TCGA results 
also revealed a significant role for TZAP expression. TZAP expression may 
involve HCC progression and its prognosis."
1175,"Background: We report the clinical case of female patient with 46,XY difference 
of sexual development (DSD) and discuss the challenges in the differential 
diagnosis between complete gonadal dysgenesis (also called Swyer syndrome) and 
complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Case Presentation: The patient's with 
primary amenorrhea gynaecological examination and magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) revealed the absence of the uterus and a very short vagina. Two sclerotic 
structures, similar to ovaries, were recognised bilaterally in the iliac 
regions. Hormonal assay tests revealed hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and the 
testosterone level was above normal. The karyotype was 46,XY and a diagnosis of 
Swyer syndrome was made. At the age of 41, the patient underwent a 
gynaecological review and after evaluating her tests and medical history, the 
previous diagnosis was questioned. Therefore, a molecular analysis of 
sex-determining region Y (SRY) and androgen receptor (AR) genes was made and the 
results instead led to a definite diagnosis of complete androgen insensitivity 
syndrome. Conclusions: The presented case illustrates that differentiating 
between complete gonadal dysgenesis and complete androgen insensitivity can be 
challenging. A well-established diagnosis is crucial because the risk of 
malignancy is different in those two syndromes, as well as the timing and 
importance of gonadectomy."
1176,"Background and Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the expression 
of genes on transcriptomic levels involved in inflammatory immune responses and 
the development of fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Materials and 
Methods: Expression patterns of 84 selected genes were analyzed with real-time 
quantitative RT PCR arrays in the peripheral blood of treatment-naive patients 
with chronic hepatitis C and healthy controls. The panel included pro- and 
anti-fibrotic genes, genes coding for extracellular matrix (EMC) structural 
constituents and remodeling enzymes, cell adhesion molecules, inflammatory 
cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, signal transduction members of the 
transforming growth factor- beta (TGF-ß) superfamily, transcription factors, and 
genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Results: The expression 
of SMAD-6 coding for a signal transduction TGF-beta superfamily member as well 
as MMP-8 coding for an ECM protein were significantly increased in CHC patients 
compared with controls. Conclusions: Chronic hepatitis C was also characterized 
by a significant downregulation of a set of genes including CAV-1, CTGF, TIMP-3, 
MMP-1, ITGA-1, LOX, ITGA-2, PLG and CEBPB encoding various biological response 
modifiers and transcription factors. Our results suggest that chronic hepatitis 
C is associated with distinct patterns of gene expression modulation in pathways 
associated with the regulation of immune responses and development of fibrosis."
1177,"The treatment of bone cancer involves tumor resection followed by bone 
reconstruction of the defect caused by the tumor using biomaterials. 
Additionally, post-surgery protocols cover chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or drug 
administration, which are employed as adjuvant treatments to prevent tumor 
recurrence. In this work, we reviewed new strategies for bone cancer treatment 
based on bioactive glasses as carriers of cancer-targeted and other drugs that 
are intended for bone regeneration in conjunction with adjuvant treatments. 
Drugs used in combination with bioactive glasses can be classified into 
cancer-target, osteoclast-target, and new therapies (such as gene delivery and 
bioinorganic). Microparticulated, nanoparticulated, or mesoporous bioactive 
glasses have been used as drug-delivery systems. Additionally, surface 
modification through functionalization or the production of composites based on 
polymers and hydrogels has been employed to improve drug-release kinetics. 
Overall, although different drugs and drug delivery systems have been developed, 
there is still room for new studies involving kinase inhibitors or 
antibody-conjugated drugs, as these drugs have been poorly explored in 
combination with bioactive glasses."
1178,"Spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) have gained significant attention due to their 
unique properties allowing them to overcome the challenges that face current 
nanocarriers used for gene therapies. The aim of this study is to synthesize and 
characterize polymer-oligonucleotide conjugates of different architecture and to 
evaluate the possibility of forming SNAs with biodegradable cores. Initially, 
two types of azide (multi)functional polyester-based (co)polymers were 
successfully synthesized and characterized. In the next step, short 
oligonucleotide strands were attached to the polymer chains applying the highly 
efficient and metal-free ""click"" reaction, thus forming conjugates with block or 
graft architecture. Both conjugates spontaneously self-assembled in aqueous 
media forming nanosized SNAs with a biodegradable polyester core and a surface 
of oligonucleotide chains as evidenced from dynamic and electrophoretic light 
scattering measurements. The nano-assemblies were in vitro evaluated for 
potential cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the interactions of the newly synthesized 
SNAs with membrane lipids were studied. The preliminary results indicate that 
both types of polymer-based SNAs are good candidates for potential application 
in gene therapy and that it is worth to be further evaluated."
1179,"PRKAG2 syndrome (PS) is a rare, early-onset autosomal dominant phenocopy of 
sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), that mainly presents with 
ventricular pre-excitation, cardiac hypertrophy and progressive conduction 
system degeneration. Its natural course, treatment and prognosis are 
significantly different from sarcomeric HCM. The clinical phenotypes of PRKAG2 
syndrome often overlap with HCM due to sarcomere protein mutations, causing this 
condition to be frequently misdiagnosed. The syndrome is caused by mutations in 
the gene encoding for the γ2 regulatory subunit (PRKAG2) of 5' Adenosine 
Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that modulates glucose 
uptake and glycolysis. PRKAG2 mutations (OMIM#602743) are responsible for 
structural changes of AMPK, leading to an impaired myocyte glucidic uptake, and 
finally causing storage cardiomyopathy. We describe the clinical and 
investigative findings in a family with several affected members 
(NM_016203.4:c.905G&gt;A or p.(Arg302Gln), heterozygous), highlighting the 
various phenotypes even in the same family, and the utility of genetic testing 
in diagnosing PS. The particularity of this family case is represented by the 
fact that the index patient was diagnosed at age 16 with cardiac hypertrophy and 
ventricular pre-excitation while his mother, by age 42, only had 
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, without left ventricle hypertrophy. Both the 
grandmother and the great-grandmother underwent pacemaker implantation at a 
young age because of conduction abnormalities. Making the distinction between PS 
and sarcomeric HCM is actionable, given the early-onset of the disease, the 
numerous life-threatening consequences and the high rate of conduction 
disorders. In patients who exhibit cardiac hypertrophy coexisting with 
ventricular pre-excitation, genetic screening for PRKAG2 mutations should be 
considered."
1180,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity 
of Weissella cibaria, Weissella hellenica and Bacillus coagulans, isolated from 
equine skin, against biofilm-forming Staphylococcus aureus CCM 4223 and clinical 
isolate methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Non-neutralized cell-free 
supernatants (nnCFS) of tested skin isolates completely inhibited the growth and 
biofilm formation of S. aureus strains and caused dispersion of the 24 h 
preformed biofilm in the range of 21-90%. The majority of the pH-neutralized 
cell-free supernatants (nCFS) of skin isolates inhibited the biofilm formation 
of both S. aureus strains in the range of 20-100%. The dispersion activity of B. 
coagulans nCFS ranged from 17 to 77% and was significantly lower than that of 
nnCFS, except for B. coagulans 3T27 against S. aureus CCM 4223. Changes in the 
growth of S. aureus CCM 4223 in the presence of catalase- or trypsin-treated W. 
hellenica 4/2D23 and W. cibaria 4/8D37 nCFS indicated the role of peroxides 
and/or bacteriocin in their antimicrobial activities. For the first time, the 
presence of the fenD gene, associated with biosurfactants production, was 
detected in B. coagulans. The results of this study showed that selected 
isolates may have the potential for the prevention and treatment of 
biofilm-forming S. aureus infections."
1181,"Intestinal microbiota appears to be implicated in the pathogenesis of 
diverticular disease. We present the case of a patient with diverticular colon 
disease complicated by a pelvic abscess. During the successful surgical 
treatment, two specimens were taken from the resected colon segment for the 
microbiota analysis: an inflamed and perforated diverticulum and a diverticulum 
without signs of inflammation. Culturing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed 
significant changes in the microbial community structure and composition 
associated with the acute inflammation and perforation of the colonic 
diverticulum. The characteristics that are usually associated with the 
inflammatory process in the gut, namely reduced microbial diversity and 
richness, decreased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio, depletion of 
butyrate-producing bacteria, and Enterobacteriaceae blooming, were more 
pronounced in the non-inflamed diverticulum rather than in the adjacent inflamed 
and perforated one. This is the first study of the intraluminal microbiota of 
the diverticular pockets, which is more relevant to the etiology of diverticular 
disease than mucosa-associated microbiota via biopsies and luminal microbiota 
via fecal samples."
1182,"The reprogramming of lipid metabolism has been highlighted in colorectal cancer 
(CRC) studies, suggesting a critical role for the scavenger receptor CD36 and 
fatty acid synthase (FASN) in this malignancy. In this study, we analyzed the 
gene expression levels of CD36, FASN, the cell surface glypican 4 (GPC4), and 
the two transporters SLC27A3 and SLC27A4 in 39 paired tumoral and peritumoral 
tissues from patients with CRC compared with 18 normal colonic mucosae. 
Moreover, the levels of seven miRNAs targeting CD36 and most of the analyzed 
genes were evaluated. We found a significant impairment of the expression of all 
the analyzed genes except GPC4 as well as the differential expression of 
miR-16-5p, miR-26b-5p, miR-107, miR-195-5p, and miR-27a-3p in the colonic mucosa 
of CRC patients. Interestingly, CD36 and miR-27a-3p were downregulated and 
upregulated, respectively, in tumoral tissues compared to peritumoral and 
control tissues, with a significant negative correlation in the group of 
patients developing lymph node metastasis. Our results sustain the relationship 
between CRC and fatty acid metabolism and emphasize the importance of related 
miRNAs in developing new therapeutic strategies."
1183,"Toxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus strains posing a potential risk for public 
health have long been a topic of scientific research. Effects of 
Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) on tissue destruction mechanisms and 
activities of inflammatory cells were presented in animal models of pneumonia 
and skin infections induced by PVL-producing S. aureus strains. This study aimed 
to demonstrate the in vivo pathogenicity of PVL-producing S. aureus strains 
isolated from some foodstuffs, which can be a potential risk to public health. 
PVL-positive methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains M1 and YF1B-b 
isolated from different foodstuffs and a PVL-positive MSSA strain HT480 
(positive control) were administered to New Zealand rabbits. Blood samples were 
harvested three and six hours after the intratracheal inoculation. Lung tissue 
samples were collected for gross and microscopic exams and immunohistochemical 
(IHC) demonstration of IL-6, IL8, IL-10, and TNF-α expressions. Serum cytokine 
levels were also measured by ELISA. The strains isolated from lung tissue 
samples were confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The development of 
acute necrotising pneumonia and a significant elevation in IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, 
and TNF-α expressions demonstrated the significance of foodborne PVL-positive 
MSSA strains in public health for the first time."
1184,"Diabetes is a leading non-communicable disease and a risk factor for relapsing 
infections. The current study was aimed at investigating the prevalence and 
antibiotic susceptibility of carbapenem-resistant (CR) uropathogens of the 
family Enterobacteriaceae in diabetic patients. The data of 910 bacterial 
isolates was collected from diagnostic laboratories during January 2018 to 
December 2018. The bacterial isolates were identified using traditional methods 
including colonial characteristics, biochemical tests, and API (20E). 
Antimicrobial susceptibility and phenotypic characterization of ESBL, MBLs, and 
KPC was determined by utilizing CLSI recommended methods. The phenotypically 
positive isolates were further analyzed for resistance-encoding genes by manual 
PCR and Check-MDR CT103XL microarray. Susceptibility to colistin and cefiderocol 
was tested in accordance with CLSI guidelines. The data revealed that most of 
the patients were suffering from type 2 diabetes for a duration of more than a 
year and with uncontrolled blood sugar levels. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella 
pneumoniae were the most frequently encountered pathogens, followed by 
Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. More than 50% of the isolates showed 
resistance to 22 antibiotics, with the highest resistance (&gt;80%) against 
tetracycline, ampicillin, and cefazolin. The uropathogens showed less resistance 
to non-β-lactam antibiotics, including amikacin, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin. 
In the phenotypic assays, 495 (54.3%) isolates were found to be ESBL producers, 
while ESBL-TEM and -PER were the most prevalent ESBL types. The resistance to 
carbapenems was slightly less (250; 27.5%) than ESBL producers, yet more common 
amongst E. coli isolates. MBL production was a common feature in 
carbapenem-resistant isolates (71.2%); genotypic characterization also validated 
this trend. The isolates were found to be sensitive against the new drugs, 
cefiderocol and eravacycline. with 7-28% resistance, except for P. mirabilis 
which had 100% resistance against eravacycline. This study concludes that a few 
types of ESBL and carbapenemases are common in the uropathogens isolated from 
the diabetic patients, and antibiotic stewardship programs need to be revisited, 
particularly to cure UTIs in diabetic patients."
1185,"Wogonin, one of the exceptional bioactive flavonoids found abundant in the roots 
of Huang-Qin (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi), is a popular health-preserving 
Chinese medicine. The therapeutic applications can be expanded by improving its 
bioavailability. The 7-O-terpenylated wogonin consisting one to three prenyl 
units are chemically synthesized for increasing lipophilic nature for efficient 
uptake, and also an attempt in mimicry of naturally scarce terpenylated 
flavonoids found in limited plant families and bee propolis. Wogonin (W) and its 
lipophilic nature prenyl wogonin (W5), geranyl wogonin (W10), and farnesyl 
wogonin (W15) were comparatively studied with structure-relationship in 
immunotoxicity of cell livability on lymphoid, myeloid, and somatic origins cell 
lines. Anti-inflammatory functions characterized with nitric oxide inhibition 
and intracellular ROS level of LPS-activated murine macrophage RAW264.7 were 
assessed. Wogonin and its terpenylated derivatives have selectively influenced 
livability of lymphoid origin cells but not myeloid and somatic origin cells. 
The mitotic protein survivin gene expressions analysis further supported the 
selective suppressions on lymphoid origin YAC-1 cells by wogonin and geranyl 
wogonin, while oppositely boosted survivin expressions in LPS-activated 
macrophages. Moreover, wogonin exhibits dose-dependent inhibition on the nitric 
oxide (NO) production and iNOS gene expressions of LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. 
Terpenylated wogonin exhibits profoundly superior control in intracellular ROS 
level and a sustained action with sound cell integrity than the wogonin. The 
enhanced cellular uptake with higher lipophilicity to membrane of 
7-O-terpenylated wogonin may pose an important biological nature in facilitating 
better bioavailability and specific immunomodulatory actions of the category of 
terpenylated flavonoids. The 7-O-terpenylated wogonin having biological merit of 
fast membrane lipid bilayer integration, lower effective concentration, and 
better preserving immune cells functions and livability deserved further 
in-depth investigations and their broadly therapeutic applications."
1186,"Isoegomaketone is a water-soluble natural ketone compound that is commonly 
present in Rabdosia angustifolia and Perilla frutescens. At present, it is known 
that isoegomaketone has a wide range of pharmacological activity, but there has 
been no thorough investigation of its potential targets. As a result, we 
examined the potential targets of isoegomaketone using the network pharmacology 
approach. In our study, the TCM Database@Taiwan was utilized to search for the 
chemical formula. The pharmacological characteristics of isoegomaketone were 
then evaluated in silico using the Swiss Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, 
and Excretion (Swiss ADME) and Deep Learning-Acute Oral Toxicity (DL-AOT) 
methods, and the potential isoegomaketone target genes were identified using a 
literature study. Additionally, using the clusterProfiler R package 3.8.1, the 
Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of target genes were performed. In 
order to obtain the protein interaction network, we simultaneously submitted the 
targets to the STRING database. After this, we performed molecular docking with 
respect to targets and isoegomaketone. Finally, we created visual networks of 
protein-protein interactions (PPI) and examined these networks. Our results 
showed that isoegomaketone had good drug-likeness, bioavailability, medicinal 
chemistry friendliness, and acceptable toxicity. Subsequently, through the 
literature analysis, 48 target genes were selected. The bioinformatics analysis 
and network analysis found that these target genes were closely related to the 
biological processes of isoegomaketone, such as atherosclerotic formation, 
inflammation, tumor formation, cytotoxicity, bacterial infection, virus 
infection, and parasite infection. These findings show that isoegomaketone may 
interact with a wide range of proteins and biochemical processes to form a 
systematic pharmacological network, which has good value for the creation and 
use of drugs."
1187,"We investigated the magnitude of exercise-induced changes in muscular 
bioenergetics, redox balance, mitochondrial function, and gene expression within 
24 h after the exercise bouts performed with different intensities, durations, 
and execution modes (continuous or with intervals). Sixty-five male Swiss mice 
were divided into four groups: one control (n = 5) and three experimental groups 
(20 animals/group), submitted to a forced swimming bout with an additional load 
(% of animal weight): low-intensity continuous (LIC), high-intensity continuous 
(HIC), and high-intensity interval (HII). Five animals from each group were 
euthanized at 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h postexercise. Gastrocnemius muscle was 
removed to analyze the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis 
(Ppargc1a), fusion (Mfn2), fission (Dnm1L), and mitophagy (Park2), as well as 
inflammation (Nos2) and antioxidant defense (Nfe2l2, GPx1). Lipid peroxidation 
(TBARS), total peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and citrate synthase 
(CS) activity were also measured. Lactacidemia was measured from a blood sample 
obtained immediately postexercise. Lactacidemia was higher the higher the 
exercise intensity (LIC &lt; HIC &lt; HII), while the inverse was observed for 
TBARS levels. The CS activity was higher in the HII group than the other groups. 
The antioxidant activity was higher 24 h postexercise in all groups compared to 
the control and greater in the HII group than the LIC and HIC groups. The gene 
expression profile exhibited a particular profile for each exercise protocol, 
but with some similarities between the LIC and HII groups. Taken together, these 
results suggest that the intervals applied to high-intensity exercise seem to 
minimize the signs of oxidative damage and drive the mitochondrial dynamics to 
maintain the mitochondrial network, similar to low-intensity continuous 
exercise."
1188,"Meloidogyne enterolobii, a highly pathogenic root-knot nematode species, causes 
serious damage to agricultural production worldwide. Collagen is an important 
part of the nematode epidermis, which is crucial for nematode shape maintenance, 
motility, and reproduction. In this study, we report that a novel collagen gene, 
Me-col-1, from the highly pathogenic root-knot nematode species Meloidogyne 
enterolobi was required for the egg formation of this pathogen. Me-col-1 encodes 
a protein with the size of 35 kDa, which is closely related to collagen found in 
other nematodes. Real-time PCR assays showed that the expression of Me-col-1 was 
highest in eggs and lowest in pre-parasitic second-stage juveniles (preJ2). 
Interestingly, knockdown of Me-col-1 did not compromise the survival rate of 
preJ2 but significantly reduced the egg production and consequentially caused 
35.79% lower multiplication rate (Pf/Pi) compared with control. Our study 
provides valuable information for better understanding the function of collagen 
genes in the nematode life cycle, which can be used in the development of 
effective approaches for nematode control."
1189,"Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are genetic metabolic diseases characterized by 
defects in the activity of lysosomal hydrolases. In MPS, secondary cell 
disturbance affects pathways related to cardiovascular disorders. Hence, the 
study aimed to identify MPS-related drugs targeting cardiovascular disease and 
select a list of drugs for repositioning. We obtained a list of differentially 
expressed genes and pathways. To identify drug perturbation-driven gene 
expression and drug pathways interactions, we used the CMAP and LINCS databases. 
For molecular docking, we used the DockThor web server. Our results suggest that 
pirfenidone and colchicine are promising drugs to treat cardiovascular disease 
in MPS patients. We also provide a brief description of good practices for the 
repositioning analysis. Furthermore, the list of drugs and related MPS-enriched 
genes could be helpful to new treatments and considered for pathophysiological 
studies."
1190,"Multiresistant Escherichia coli has been disseminated worldwide, and it is one 
of the major causative agents of nosocomial infections. E. coli has a remarkable 
and complex genomic plasticity for taking up and accumulating genetic elements; 
thus, multiresistant high-risk clones can evolve. In this review, we summarise 
all available data about internationally disseminated extraintestinal pathogenic 
high-risk E. coli clones based on whole-genome sequence (WGS) data and confirmed 
outbreaks. Based on genetic markers, E. coli is clustered into eight 
phylogenetic groups. Nowadays, the E. coli ST131 clone from phylogenetic group 
B2 is the predominant high-risk clone worldwide. Currently, strains of the 
C1-M27 subclade within clade C of ST131 are circulating and becoming prominent 
in Canada, China, Germany, Hungary and Japan. The C1-M27 subclade is 
characterised by blaCTX-M-27. Recently, the ST1193 clone has been reported as an 
emerging high-risk clone from phylogenetic group B2. ST38 clone carrying 
blaOXA-244 (a blaOXA-48-like carbapenemase gene) caused several outbreaks in 
Germany and Switzerland. Further high-risk international E. coli clones include 
ST10, ST69, ST73, ST405, ST410, ST457. High-risk E. coli strains are present in 
different niches, in the human intestinal tract and in animals, and persist in 
environment. These strains can be transmitted easily within the community as 
well as in hospital settings. WGS analysis is a useful tool for tracking the 
dissemination of resistance determinants, the emergence of high-risk 
mulitresistant E. coli clones and to analyse changes in the E. coli population 
on a genomic level."
1191,"Particle therapy is a developing area of radiotherapy, mostly involving the use 
of protons, neutrons and carbon ions for cancer treatment. The reduction of side 
effects on healthy tissues in the peritumoral area is an important advantage of 
particle therapy. In this review, we analyze state-of-the-art particle therapy, 
as compared to conventional photon therapy, to identify clinical benefits and 
specify the mechanisms of action on tumor cells. Systematization of published 
data on particle therapy confirms its successful application in a wide range of 
cancers and reveals a variety of biological effects which manifest at the 
molecular level and produce the particle therapy-specific molecular signatures. 
Given the rapid progress in the field, the use of particle therapy holds great 
promise for the near future."
1192,"Priming is used as a method to improve plant growth and alleviate the 
detrimental effects of pathogens. The present study was conducted to evaluate 
the effects of different priming methods in the context of resistance to 
Aspergillus niger in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Here, we show that different 
priming treatments-viz., hydropriming, osmotic priming, halopriming, and 
hormonal priming techniques can induce disease resistance by improving the 
biochemical contents of wheat, including chlorophyll, protein, proline, and 
sugar. In addition, physiological parameters-such as root length, shoot length, 
fresh and dry root/shoot ratios, and relative water content were positively 
affected by these priming methods. In essence, hydropriming and osmotic priming 
treatments were found to be more potent for enhancing wheat biochemical 
contents, along with all the physiological parameters, and for reducing disease 
severity. Hydropriming and osmotic priming significantly decreased disease 
severity, by 70.59-75.00% and 64.71-88.33%, respectively. RT-PCR and 
quantitative real-time PCR analyses of potentially important 
pathogenesis-related (PR)-protein genes (Thaumatin-like protein (TLP), 
chitinase, and β-1,3-glucanase) in primed plants were evaluated: β-1,3-glucanase 
was most highly expressed in all primed plants; Chitinase and TLP exhibited 
higher expression in hormonal-, halo-, osmotic-, and hydro-primed plants, 
respectively. These results suggest that the higher expression of 
β-1,3-glucanase,&amp;nbsp;TLP, and chitinase after hydropriming and osmotic 
priming may increase disease resistance in wheat. Our study demonstrates the 
greater potential of hydropriming and osmotic priming for alleviating stress 
caused by A. niger inoculation, and enhancing resistance to it, in addition to 
significantly improving plant growth. Thus, these priming methods could be 
beneficial for better plant growth and disease resistance in other plants."
1193,"High mortality rates have been reported in historical cohorts of acute 
intermittent porphyria (AIP) patients. The mortality associated with 
(hydroxymethylbilane synthase) HMBS variant heterozygosity is unknown. This 
study estimates all-cause mortality in pedigrees with HMBS gene variants that 
cause AIP. We collected data on the lifespan of individuals in Dutch AIP 
pedigrees and performed analyses using the family tree mortality ratio method. 
This gave us standardized mortality ratios for these pedigrees compared to the 
Dutch general population as a primary outcome. Between 1810 and 2017, the 
overall mortality in these pedigrees was identical to that of the general Dutch 
population: (SMR 1.01, p = 0.441). However, compared with the general population 
the SMR was significantly higher in women aged 45-64 years (SMR 1.99, p = 
0.00003), which was based on excess mortality between 1915 and 1964 (SMR 1.94, p 
&lt; 0.00002). In men aged 70-74 years, the SMR was 1.55 (p = 0.0021), based on 
excess mortality that occurred between 1925 and 1964 (SMR 1.92, p = 0000000003). 
Overall, mortality from HMBS variant heterozygosity was not increased compared 
with the general population. Severe excess mortality occurred in young women and 
old men between 1915 and 1964. Heterozygotes reached a normal lifespan during 
the past half-century, in parallel with disease awareness and the prevention of 
new attacks through family counselling."
1194,"Lernaea cyprinacea infestation is considered a serious economic problem in the 
fish market. An assessment to control this parasite is needed to manage this 
problem. The Illicium verum oil extract has considerable antioxidant activity 
and scavenges 96.22% of free radicals; the high antioxidant activity refers to 
the phenolic content presence. The extract contains minerals, especially K, 
fibers, and dry matter. So, the Illicium verum ingredients were tested against 
this copepod for in vitro and in vivo investigation with the assessment of the 
treatment trial using a scanning electron microscope and evaluating the change 
in different immunological genes in goldfish. Female parasitic L. cyprinacea 
worms were blackish and hairy. The in vitro study on L. cyprinacea adults using 
star anise revealed that the LC50 was 12.5 and 25 μg/mL for 2 and 1 h exposure 
periods, respectively. Interleukin (IL-1β) and IL-6 were grossly upregulated in 
C. auratus-infested skin by L. cyprinacea after treatment by 1 week, then 
declined after 3 weeks. In contrast, TNF-α was 18 folds upregulated in the first 
week after treatment, with a decline after 3 weeks. In conclusion, star anise is 
recommended as a safe and economical agent for controlling L. cyprinacea 
infestation in fish."
1195,"Eriocheir sinensis is an euryhaline crab found from East Asia to Europe and 
North America. This species can live in freshwater and seawater due to the 
unique physiological characteristics of their life cycle, which allows them to 
adapt and inhabit different habitats in a wide range of environments. Despite 
the wealth of studies focusing on adaptation mechanism of E. sinensis to 
specific environmental factors, the adaptation mechanisms to wild habitats with 
coexisting environmental factors are not well understood. In this study, we 
conducted a transcriptome analysis to investigate gene expression differences 
related to habitat adaptation of E. sinensis from two wild habitats with 
different environmental factors in the Han River, Korea. A total of 138,261 
unigenes were analyzed, of which 228 were analyzed as differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) between the two wild habitats. Among 228 DEGs, 110 DEGs were 
annotated against databases; most DEGs were involved in energy metabolism, 
immunity, and osmoregulation. Moreover, DEG enrichment analysis showed that 
upregulated genes were related to biosynthesis, metabolism, and immunity in an 
habitat representing relatively high salinity whereas downregulated genes were 
related to ion transport and hypoxia response in habitats with relatively low 
salinity and dissolved oxygen. The present findings can serve as foundation for 
future E. sinensis culture or conservation approaches in natural conditions."
1196,"The aim of this study was to explore the effects of pre-pregnancy 
overweight/obesity on the pattern of association of hypertension susceptibility 
genes with preeclampsia (PE). Ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the 
10 genome-wide association studies (GWAS)-significant hypertension/blood 
pressure (BP) candidate genes were genotyped in 950 pregnant women divided into 
two cohorts according to their pre-pregnancy body mass index (preBMI): preBMI ≥ 
25 (162 with PE and 159 control) and preBMI &lt; 25 (290 with PE and 339 
control). The PLINK software package was utilized to study the association 
(analyzed four genetic models using logistic regression). The functionality of 
PE-correlated loci was analyzed by performing an in silico database analysis. 
Two SNP hypertension/BP genes, rs805303 BAG6 (OR: 0.36-0.66) and rs167479 RGL3 
(OR: 1.86), in subjects with preBMI ≥ 25 were associated with PE. No association 
between the studied SNPs and PE in the preBMI &lt; 25 group was determined. 
Further analysis showed that two PE-associated SNPs are functional (have weighty 
eQTL, sQTL, regulatory, and missense values) and could be potentially implicated 
in PE development. In conclusion, this study was the first to discover the 
modifying influence of overweight/obesity on the pattern of association of 
GWAS-significant hypertension/BP susceptibility genes with PE: these genes are 
linked with PE in preBMI ≥ 25 pregnant women and are not PE-involved in the 
preBMI &lt; 25 group."
1197,"Deciphering cancer etiopathogenesis has proven to be an especially challenging 
task since the mechanisms that drive tumor development and progression are far 
from simple. An astonishing amount of research has revealed a wide spectrum of 
defects, including genomic abnormalities, epigenomic alterations, disturbance of 
gene transcription, as well as post-translational protein modifications, which 
cooperatively promote carcinogenesis. These findings suggest that the adoption 
of a multidimensional approach can provide a much more precise and comprehensive 
picture of the tumor landscape, hence serving as a powerful tool in cancer 
research and precision oncology. The introduction of next- and third-generation 
sequencing technologies paved the way for the decoding of genetic information 
and the elucidation of cancer-related cellular compounds and mechanisms. In the 
present review, we discuss the current and emerging applications of both 
generations of sequencing technologies, also referred to as massive parallel 
sequencing (MPS), in the fields of cancer genomics, transcriptomics and 
proteomics, as well as in the progressing realms of epi-omics. Finally, we 
provide a brief insight into the expanding scope of sequencing applications in 
personalized cancer medicine and pharmacogenomics."
1198,"Defects in signaling pathways are the root cause of many disorders. These 
malformations come in a wide variety of types, and their causes are also very 
diverse. Some of these flaws can be brought on by pathogenic organisms and 
viruses, many of which can obstruct signaling processes. Other illnesses are 
linked to malfunctions in the way that cell signaling pathways work. When 
thinking about how errors in signaling pathways might cause disease, the idea of 
signalosome remodeling is helpful. The signalosome may be conveniently divided 
into two types of defects: phenotypic remodeling and genotypic remodeling. The 
majority of significant illnesses that affect people, including high blood 
pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and many types of mental illness, appear to 
be caused by minute phenotypic changes in signaling pathways. Such phenotypic 
remodeling modifies cell behavior and subverts normal cellular processes, 
resulting in illness. There has not been much progress in creating efficient 
therapies since it has been challenging to definitively confirm this connection 
between signalosome remodeling and illness. The considerable redundancy included 
into cell signaling systems presents several potential for developing novel 
treatments for various disease conditions. One of the most important pathways, 
NF-κB, controls several aspects of innate and adaptive immune responses, is a 
key modulator of inflammatory reactions, and has been widely studied both from 
experimental and theoretical perspectives. NF-κB contributes to the control of 
inflammasomes and stimulates the expression of a number of pro-inflammatory 
genes, including those that produce cytokines and chemokines. Additionally, 
NF-κB is essential for controlling innate immune cells and inflammatory T cells' 
survival, activation, and differentiation. As a result, aberrant NF-κB 
activation plays a role in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory illnesses. 
The activation and function of NF-κB in relation to inflammatory illnesses was 
covered here, and the advancement of treatment approaches based on NF-κB 
inhibition will be highlighted. This review presents the temporal behavior of 
NF-κB and its potential relevance in different human diseases which will be 
helpful not only for theoretical but also for experimental perspectives."
1199,"Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is an important zoonotic pathogen. It mainly uses 
quorum sensing (QS) to adapt to complex and changeable environments. QS is a 
universal cell-to-cell communication system that has been widely studied for its 
physiological functions, including the regulation of bacterial adhesion, 
virulence, and biofilm formation. Quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) are highly 
effective at interfering with the QS system and bacteria have trouble developing 
resistance to them. We review the current research status of the S. suis 
LuxS/AI-2 QS system and QSIs. Studies showed that by inhibiting the formation of 
AI-2, targeting the LuxS protein, inhibiting the expression of luxs gene can 
control the LuxS/AI-2 QS system of S. suis. Other potential QSIs targets are 
summarized, which may be preventing and treating S. suis infections, including 
AI-2 production, transmission, LuxS protein, blockage of AI-2 binding to 
receptors, AI-2-mediated QS. Since antibiotics are becoming increasingly 
ineffective due to the emergence of resistant bacteria, including S. suis, it is 
thus critical to find new antibacterial drugs with different mechanisms of 
action. QSIs provide hope for the development of such drugs."
1200,"The Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Liviidae) is a major 
citrus pest spread around the world. It is also a vector of the bacterium 
'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus', considered the cause of the fatal citrus 
disease huanglongbing (HLB). Insect ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are the primary 
target sites of diamide insecticides. In this study, full-length RyR cDNA from 
D. citri (named DcRyR) was isolated and identified. The 15,393 bp long open 
reading frame of DcRyR encoded a 5130 amino acid protein with a calculated 
molecular weight of 580,830 kDa. This protein had a high sequence identity 
(76-79%) with other insect homologs and a low sequence identity (43-46%) with 
mammals. An MIR domain, two RIH domains, three SPRY domains, four RyR repeat 
domains, an RIH-associated domain at the N-terminus, two consensus 
calcium-binding EF-hands, and six transmembrane domains were among the 
characteristics that DcRyR shared with insect and vertebrate RyRs. In expression 
analysis, the DcRyR gene displayed transcript abundance in all tissues and 
developmental stages as well as gene-differential and stage-specific patterns. 
In addition, diagnostic PCR experiments revealed that DcRyR had three potential 
alternative splice variants and that splicing events might have contributed to 
the various functions of DcRyR. However, diamide resistance-related amino acid 
residue mutations I4790M/K and G4946E were not found in DcRyR. These results can 
serve as the basis for further investigation into the target-based diamide 
pesticide resistance of D. citri."
1201,"Overuse of nitrogen fertilizer in fields has raised production costs, and caused 
environmental problems. Improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of rice is 
essential for sustainable agriculture. Here we report the cloning, 
characterization and roles for rice of OsNPF7.6, a member of the nitrate 
transporter 1/peptide transporter family (NPF). The OsNPF7.6 protein is located 
in the plasma membrane, expressed in each tissue at all stages and is 
significantly regulated by nitrate in rice. Our study shows that the 
overexpression of OsNPF7.6 can increase the nitrate uptake rate of rice. 
Additionally, field experiments showed that OsNPF7.6 overexpression increased 
the total tiller number per plant and the grain weight per panicle, thereby 
improving grain yield and agronomic NUE in rice. Thus, OsNPF7.6 can be applied 
to be a novel target gene for breeding rice varieties with high NUE, and provide 
a reference for breeding higher yielding rice."
1202,"Plant-specific Rac/Rop small GTPases, also known as Rop, belong to the Rho 
subfamily. Rac proteins can be divided into two types according to their 
C-terminal motifs: Type I Rac proteins have a typical CaaL motif at the 
C-terminal, whereas type II Rac proteins lack this motif but retain a 
cysteine-containing element for membrane anchoring. The Rac gene family 
participates in diverse signal transduction events, cytoskeleton morphogenesis, 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and hormone responses in plants as 
molecular switches. S. album is a popular semiparasitic plant that absorbs 
nutrients from the host plant through the haustoria to meet its own growth and 
development needs. Because the whole plant has a high use value, due to the high 
production value of its perfume oils, it is known as the ""tree of gold"". Based 
on the full-length transcriptome data of S. album, nine Rac gene members were 
named SaRac1-9, and we analyzed their physicochemical properties. Evolutionary 
analysis showed that SaRac1-7, AtRac1-6, AtRac9 and AtRac11 and OsRac5, OsRacB 
and OsRacD belong to the typical plant type I Rac/Rop protein, while SaRac8-9, 
AtRac7, AtRac8, AtRac10 and OsRac1-4 belong to the type II Rac/ROP protein. 
Tissue-specific expression analysis showed that nine genes were expressed in 
roots, stems, leaves and haustoria, and SaRac7/8/9 expression in stems, 
haustoria and roots was significantly higher than that in leaves. The expression 
levels of SaRac1, SaRac4 and SaRac6 in stems were very low, and the expression 
levels of SaRac2 and SaRac5 in roots and SaRac2/3/7 in haustoria were very high, 
which indicated that these genes were closely related to the formation of S. 
album haustoria. To further analyze the function of SaRac, nine Rac genes in 
sandalwood were subjected to drought stress and hormone treatments. These 
results establish a preliminary foundation for the regulation of growth and 
development in S. album by SaRac."
1203,"Aeromonas species exhibit widespread presence in food, poultry, and aquaculture. 
They are major multi-drug-resistant fish pathogens. This study aims to identify 
Aeromonas species harbouring virulence genes aerolysin, flagellin, and lipase 
from diseased fishes of Assam wetlands with association with antibiotic 
resistance and in vivo pathogenicity. One hundred and thirty-four Aeromonas 
strains were isolated and thirty representative species identified using 
genus-specific 16S rRNA gene amplification. A. veronii was most prevalent 
(53.7%) followed by A. hydrophila (40.2%), A. caviae (4.47%), and A. dhakensis 
(1.49%). Ninety percent (90%) of strains harboured at least one of the studied 
virulence genes: aerA (73.3%), lip (46.6%), and flaA (26.6%). The highest 
multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index 0.8 corresponded to A. hydrophila 
DBTNE1 (MZ723069), containing all the studied genes. The lowest LD50 values (1.6 
× 106 CFU/fish) corresponded to isolates having both aerA and lip. β-lactams 
showed utmost resistance and lowest for aminoglycosides. There was a significant 
(p &lt; 0.05) Pearson chi-square test of association between the occurrence of 
virulence and antibiotic resistance. The in silico protein-protein interaction 
revealed important drug targets, such as σ28 transcription factor, 
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, and diacylglycerol kinase, with significant (p &lt; 
0.05) enrichment. This study suggests that fish-isolate Aeromonas strains 
represent potential threat to aquaculture with subsequent risk of transferring 
antibiotic resistance to human pathogens."
1204,"Commonly studied in the context of legume-rhizobia symbiosis, biological 
nitrogen fixation (BNF) is a key component of the nitrogen cycle in nature. 
Despite its potential in plant breeding and many years of research, information 
is still lacking as to the regulation of hundreds of genes connected with 
plant-bacteria interaction, nodulation, and nitrogen fixation. Here, we compared 
root nodule transcriptomes of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) genotypes with 
contrasting nitrogen fixation efficiency, and we found 491 differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) between plants with high and low BNF efficiency. The 
annotation of genes expressed in nodules revealed more than 800 genes not yet 
experimentally confirmed. Among genes mediating nodule development, four 
nod-ule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides were confirmed in the nodule 
transcriptome. Gene duplication analyses revealed that genes originating from 
tandem and dispersed duplication are significantly over-represented among DEGs. 
Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) organized expression profiles of 
the transcripts into 16 modules linked to the analyzed traits, such as nitrogen 
fixation efficiency or sample-specific modules. Overall, the results obtained 
broaden our knowledge about transcriptomic landscapes of red clover's root 
nodules and shift the phenotypic description of BNF efficiency on the level of 
gene expression in situ."
1205,"Genetically modified microorganisms (GMM) are frequently employed for 
manufacturing microbial fermentation products such as food enzymes or vitamins. 
Although the fermentation product is required to be pure, GMM contaminations 
have repeatedly been reported in numerous commercial microbial fermentation 
produce types, leading to several rapid alerts at the European level. The aim of 
this study was to investigate the added value of shotgun metagenomic 
high-throughput sequencing to confirm and extend the results of classical 
analysis methods for the genomic characterization of unauthorized GMM. By 
combining short- and long-read metagenomic sequencing, two transgenic constructs 
were characterized, with insertions of alpha-amylase genes originating from B. 
amyloliquefaciens and B. licheniformis, respectively, and a transgenic construct 
with a protease gene insertion originating from B. velezensis, which were all 
present in all four investigated samples. Additionally, the samples were 
contaminated with up to three unculturable Bacillus strains, carrying genetic 
modifications that may hamper their ability to sporulate. Moreover, several 
samples contained viable Bacillus strains. Altogether these contaminations 
constitute a considerable load of antimicrobial resistance genes, that may 
represent a potential public health risk. In conclusion, our study showcases the 
added value of metagenomics to investigate the quality and safety of complex 
commercial microbial fermentation products."
1206,"Rare diseases affect the life of a tremendous number of people globally. The 
CRISPR-Cas system emerged as a powerful genome engineering tool and has 
facilitated the comprehension of the mechanism and development of therapies for 
rare diseases. This review focuses on current efforts to develop the 
CRISPR-based toolbox for various rare disease therapy applications and compares 
the pros and cons of different tools and delivery methods. We further discuss 
the therapeutic applications of CRISPR-based tools for fighting different rare 
diseases."
1207,"The Hedgehog signaling pathway functions in both embryonic development and adult 
tissue homeostasis. Importantly, its aberrant activation is also implicated in 
the progression of multiple types of cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and 
medulloblastoma. GLI transcription factors function as the ultimate effectors of 
the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Their activity is regulated by this signaling 
cascade via their mRNA expression, protein stability, subcellular localization, 
and ultimately their transcriptional activity. Further, GLI proteins are also 
regulated by a variety of non-canonical mechanisms in addition to the canonical 
Hedgehog pathway. Recently, with an increased understanding of epigenetic gene 
regulation, novel transcriptional regulators have been identified that interact 
with GLI proteins in multi-protein complexes to regulate GLI transcriptional 
activity. Such complexes have added another layer of complexity to the 
regulation of GLI proteins. Here, we summarize recent work on the regulation of 
GLI transcriptional activity by these novel protein complexes and describe their 
relevance to cancer, as such GLI regulators represent alternative and innovative 
druggable targets in GLI-dependent cancers."
1208,"Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agent of human granulocytic 
anaplasmosis (HGA), is an obligate intracellular bacterium transmitted by the 
bite of black-legged ticks, Ixodes scapularis. The main host cells in 
vertebrates are neutrophils. However, the first site of entry is in the skin 
during tick feeding. Given that the initial responses within skin are a crucial 
determinant of disease outcome in vector-borne diseases, we used a non-biased 
approach to characterize the transcriptional changes that take place at the bite 
during I. scapularis feeding and A. phagocytophilum transmission. Experimentally 
infected ticks were allowed to feed for 3 days on C57BL/6J mice to allow 
bacterial transmission and establishment. Skin biopsies were taken from the 
attachment site of uninfected ticks and A. phagocytophilum-infected ticks. Skin 
without ticks (intact skin) was used as baseline. RNA was isolated and sequenced 
using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The differentially expressed genes were 
used to identify over-represented pathways by gene ontology (GO) and pathway 
enrichment (PE). Anaplasma phagocytophilum transmission resulted in the 
activation of interferon signaling and neutrophil chemotaxis pathways in the 
skin. Interestingly, it also led to the downregulation of genes encoding 
extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and upregulation of metalloproteinases, 
suggesting that A. phagocytophilum delays wound healing responses and may 
increase vascular permeability at the bite site."
1209,"The gastrointestinal tract is the largest and most complex component of the 
immune system. Each component influences the production and regulation of 
cytokines secreted by intestinal epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to 
see how the probiotic strain Limosilactobacillus reuteri L26 and its 
exopolysaccharide (EPS) affect porcine intestinal-epithelial cells IPEC-J2 
infected with Salmonella Typhimurium. The results revealed that Salmonella 
infection up-regulated all studied pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, 
IL-8, IL-6 and TLR4, TLR5 signaling pathways, while decreasing the expression of 
TGF-β. An immunosuppressive activity was found in EPS-treated wells, since the 
transcriptional levels of the studied pro-inflammatory cytokines were not 
increased, and the pretreatment with EPS was even able to attenuate up-regulated 
pro-inflammatory genes induced by Salmonella infection. However, there was a 
significant increase in the expression of mRNA levels of IL-8 and TNF-α in 
L26-treated cells, although this up-regulation was suppressed in the case of 
pretreatment. The immunoregulatory function of L. reuteri was also confirmed by 
the increased level of mRNA expression for TGF-β, a known immunosuppressive 
mediator. The most relevant finding of this ex vivo study was a case of immunity 
modulation, where the probiotic strain L. reuteri stimulated the innate 
immune-cell response which displayed both anti- and pro-inflammatory activities, 
and modulated the expression of TLRs in the IPEC-J2 cell line. Our findings also 
revealed that the pretreatment of cells with either EPS or live lactobacilli 
prior to infection has a suppressive effect on the inflammatory response induced 
by Salmonella Typhimurium."
1210,"In China, wheat yellow mosaic disease is mostly caused by wheat yellow mosaic 
virus (WYMV) and Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV). If wheat is co-infected with 
these two viruses, it can cause severe yellow mosaic symptoms and yield losses. 
Early detection of viruses is crucial for preventing disease in the field. In 
this study, we optimized a sensitive, specific reverse transcription recombinase 
polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) detection method for two viruses, WYMV and 
CWMV. Two sets of primers were designed based on the capsid protein 
(CP)-encoding genes of the two viruses, and the reaction conditions were 
determined. The RT-RPA method, which amplified the target amplicon by a handheld 
reaction mixture for 20 min, was more sensitive than PCR-CP in the detection of 
WYMV. Finally, the RT-RPA method was performed on 110 randomly selected field 
samples, demonstrating its applicability to samples from different regions and 
specificity for co-infected samples. This study not only describes an improved 
method for detecting WYMV and CWMV using RT-RPA but also demonstrates the 
potential of this method, which could be applied under field conditions."
1211,"In recent years, the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and mortality caused by the 
disease have been decreasing. However, the number of drug-resistant tuberculosis 
patients is increasing rapidly year by year. Here, a total of 380 Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (MTB)-positive formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) 
specimens diagnosed in the Department of Pathology of the Eighth Medical Center, 
Chinese PLA General Hospital were collected. Among 380 cases of MTB, 85 (22.37%) 
were susceptible to four anti-TB drugs and the remaining 295 (77.63%) were 
resistant to one or more drugs. The rate of MDR-TB was higher in previously 
treated cases (52.53%) than in new cases [(36.65%), p  &lt;  0.05]. Of 
previously treated cases, the rate of drug resistance was higher in females than 
in males (p  &lt;  0.05). Among specimens obtained from males, the rate of drug 
resistance was higher in new cases than in previously treated cases (p  &lt; 
 0.05). Of mutation in drug resistance-related genes, the majority (53/380, 
13.95%) of rpoB gene carried the D516V mutation, and 13.42% (51/380) featured 
mutations in both the katG and inhA genes. Among the total specimens, 18.68% 
(71/380) carried the 88 M mutation in the rpsL gene, and the embB gene focused 
on the 306 M2 mutation with a mutation rate of 19.74%. Among the resistant INH, 
the mutation rate of -15 M was higher in resistance to more than one drug than 
in monodrug-resistant (p  &lt;  0.05). In conclusion, the drug resistance of MTB 
is still very severe and the timely detection of drug resistance is conducive to 
the precise treatment of TB."
1212,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the highly susceptible genes to 
breast cancer (BC); however, the role of PTEN-related RNAs in BC remains poorly 
understood. Understanding the effect of PTEN-related RNAs and their mechanisms 
may be helpful to clinicians. We screened the differentially expressed RNAs 
(deRNAs) related to PTEN and established the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) 
network by integrating several databases. After that, the RNA model, prolactin 
receptor (PRLR)/calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit alpha2delta 1 
(CACNA2D1), was obtained by KM survival analysis and logistic regression 
analysis. Finally, mutation, methylation, functional enrichment, and immune 
correlation were analyzed to explore the roles of these RNAs. Our results showed 
that PRLR might be harmful to BC, while CACNA2D1 might be beneficial to BC. 
Furthermore, the abnormal expression of PRLR in BC might result from mutation 
and hypomethylation, while the aberrant expression of CACNA2D1 might be ascribed 
to methylation. Mechanistically, PRLR might affect the prognosis of BC by 
inhibiting the expression of immune checkpoints, while CACNA2D1 might improve 
the prognosis of BC by increasing the immune cells infiltrating into BC and 
up-regulating the expression of immune checkpoints. The abnormal expression of 
PRLR and CACNA2D1 in BC is closely related to the prognosis of BC, and they may 
serve as targets for the treatment of BC."
1213,"Elevated levels of STIM1, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor/buffering 
protein, appear to be correlated with poor cancer prognosis in which microRNAs 
are also known to play critical roles. The purpose of this study is to 
investigate possible HBV origins of specific microRNAs we identified in a stem 
cell-like subpopulation of Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines with 
enhanced STIM1 and/or Orai1 expression that mimicked poor cancer prognosis. 
Computational strategies including phylogenetic analyses were performed on 
miRNome data we obtained from an EpCAM- and CD133-expressing Huh-7 HCC stem 
cell-like subpopulation with enhanced STIM1 and/or Orai1 expression originally 
cultured in the present work. Results revealed two putative regions in the HBV 
genome based on the apparent clustering pattern of stem loop sequences of 
microRNAs, including miR3653. Reciprocal analysis of these regions identified 
critical human genes, of which their transcripts are among the predicted targets 
of miR3653, which was increased significantly by STIM1 or Orai1 enhancement. 
Briefly, this study provides phylogenetic evidence for a possible HBV-driven 
epigenetic remodeling that alters the expression pattern of Ca2+ 
homeostasis-associated genes in STIM1- or Orai1 overexpressing liver cancer 
stem-like cells for a possible mutual survival outcome. A novel region on HBV-X 
protein may affect liver carcinogenesis in a genotype-dependent manner. 
Therefore, detection of the viral genotype would have a clinical impact on 
prognosis of HBV-induced liver cancers."
1214,"Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still one of the types of 
cancer with the highest death rates. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in 
NSCLC development. This study evaluates miRNA expression patterns and specific 
mechanisms in male patients with NSCLC. Methods: We report an integrated 
microarray analysis of miRNAs for eight matched samples of males with NSCLC 
compared to the study of public datasets of males with NSCLC from TCGA, followed 
by qRT-PCR validation. Results: For the TCGA dataset, we identified 385 
overexpressed and 75 underexpressed miRNAs. Our cohort identified 54 
overexpressed and 77 underexpressed miRNAs, considering a fold-change (FC) of 
±1.5 and p &lt; 0.05 as the cutoff value. The common miRNA signature consisted 
of eight overexpressed and nine underexpressed miRNAs. Validation was performed 
using qRT-PCR on the tissue samples for miR-183-3p and miR-34c-5p and on plasma 
samples for miR-34c-5p. We also created mRNA-miRNA regulatory networks to 
identify critical molecules, revealing NSCLC signaling pathways related to 
underexpressed and overexpressed transcripts. The genes targeted by these 
transcripts were correlated with overall survival. Conclusions: miRNAs and some 
of their target genes could play essential roles in investigating the mechanisms 
involved in NSCLC evolution and provide opportunities to identify potential 
therapeutic targets."
1215,"The mucin (MUC) family includes several genes aberrantly expressed in multiple 
carcinomas and mediates diverse pathways essentials for oncogenesis, in both 
solid and hematological malignancies. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) can 
have its course influenced by genetic variants, and it seems more frequent in 
the Amerindian population, which has been understudied. Therefore, the present 
work aimed to investigate the MUC family exome in Amerindian individuals from 
the Brazilian Amazon, in a sample containing healthy Native Americans (NAMs) and 
indigenous subjects with ALL, comparing the frequency of polymorphisms between 
these two groups. The population was composed of 64 Amerindians from the 
Brazilian Amazon, from 12 different isolated tribes, five of whom were diagnosed 
with ALL. We analyzed 16 genes from the MUC family and found a total of 1858 
variants. We compared the frequency of each variant in the ALL vs. NAM group, 
which led to 77 variants with a significant difference and, among these, we 
excluded those with a low impact, resulting in 63 variants, which were 
distributed in nine genes, concentrated especially in MUC 19 (n = 30) and MUC 3A 
(n = 18). Finally, 11 new variants were found in the NAM population. This is the 
first work with a sample of native Americans with cancer, a population which is 
susceptible to ALL, but remains understudied. The MUC family seems to have an 
influence on the development of ALL in the Amerindian population and especially 
MUC19 and MUC3A are shown as possible hotspots. In addition, the 11 new variants 
found point to the need to have their clinical impact analyzed."
1216,"Gastric cancer is ranked fifth among the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and is 
the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The majority of 
gastric cancers are sporadic, while only a small percentage, less than 1%, are 
hereditary. Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is a rare malignancy, 
characterized by early-onset, highly-penetrant autosomal dominant inheritance 
mainly of the germline alterations in the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) and β-catenin 
(CTNNA1). In the present study, we provide an overview on the molecular basis of 
HDGC and outline the essential elements of genetic counseling and surveillance. 
We further provide a practical summary of current guidelines on clinical 
management and treatment of individuals at risk and patients with early disease."
1217,"Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common female cancer. Excellent clinical 
outcomes have been achieved with current screening tests and medical treatments 
in the early stages, while the advanced stage has a poor prognosis. Nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism is implicated in cancer development and 
has been enhanced as a new therapeutic concept for cancer treatment. This study 
set out to identify an NAD+ metabolic-related gene signature for the prospect of 
cervical cancer survival and prognosis. Tissue profiles and clinical 
characteristics of 293 cervical cancer patients and normal tissues were 
downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to obtain NAD+ 
metabolic-related genes. Based on the differentially expressed NAD+ 
metabolic-related genes, cervical cancer patients were divided into two 
subgroups (Clusters 1 and 2) using consensus clustering. In total, 1404 
differential genes were acquired from the clinical data of these two subgroups. 
From the NAD+ metabolic-related genes, 21 candidate NAD+ metabolic-related genes 
(ADAMTS10, ANGPTL5, APCDD1L, CCDC85A, CGREF1, CHRDL2, CRP, DENND5B, EFS, FGF8, 
P4HA3, PCDH20, PCDHAC2, RASGRF2, S100P, SLC19A3, SLC6A14, TESC, TFPI, TNMD, 
ZNF229) were considered independent indicators of cervical cancer prognosis 
through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The 21-gene 
signature was significantly different between the low- and high-risk groups in 
the training and validation datasets. Our work revealed the promising clinical 
prediction value of NAD+ metabolic-related genes in cervical cancer."
1218,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has a favorable prognosis, but a fraction of 
cases show progressive behaviors, becoming radioiodine refractory (RAIR) PTC. To 
explore circulating exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with RAIR PTC, the 
miRNA profiles in exosomes from parental and induced RAIR cell lines were 
firstly identified with a next-generation sequencing technique. The Na+/I- 
symporter (NIS) related miRNAs were then validated by quantitative real-time PCR 
(qRT-PCR) in plasma of PTC patients with non-131I-avid metastases and those with 
131I-avid metastases. The regulation of exosomal miRNAs on NIS were also 
verified. We identified that miR-1296-5p, upregulation in exosomes from RAIR 
cell lines, and the plasma of patients with RAIR PTC achieved the largest areas 
under the curve (AUC) of 0.911 and that it is an independent risk factor for 
RAIR PTC. In addition, miR-1296-5p was abundantly detected in the tissue of RAIR 
PTC and can directly target downstream gene of NIS. Taken together, our findings 
suggested that circulating exosomal miRNAs, particularly miR-1296-5p, may be 
involved in the pathogenesis of RAIR PTC by directly targeting NIS."
1219,"In this nonsystematic review and opinion, including articles primarily selected 
from PubMed, we examine the pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments of 
neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in order to craft a reasonable opinion to 
help forge a paradigm shift in the treatment and prevention of primarily 
opioid-induced NAS. Newborns of individuals who use illicit and licit substances 
during pregnancy are at risk for withdrawal, also known as NAS. In the US, the 
reported prevalence of NAS has increased from 4.0 per 1000 hospital births in 
2010 to 7.3 per 1000 hospital births in 2017, which is an 82% increase. The 
management of NAS is varied and involves a combination of nonpharmacologic and 
pharmacologic therapy. The preferred first-line pharmacological treatment for 
NAS is opioid therapy, specifically morphine, and the goal is the short-term 
improvement in NAS symptomatology. Nonpharmacological therapies are 
individualized and typically focus on general care measures, the 
newborn-parent/caregiver relationship, the environment, and feeding. When used 
appropriately, nonpharmacologic therapies can help newborns with NAS avoid or 
reduce the amount of pharmacologic therapy required and the length of 
hospitalization. In addition, genetic polymorphisms of the 
catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) and mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) genes appear 
to affect the length of stay and the need for pharmacotherapy in newborns with 
prenatal opioid exposure. Therefore, based on this extensive literature and 
additional research, this team of coauthors suggests that, in the future, in 
addition to the current nonpharmacological therapies, patients with 
opioid-induced NAS should undergo genetic assessment (i.e., the genetic 
addiction risk severity (GARS) test), which can subsequently be used to guide 
DNA-directed precision amino-acid enkephalinase inhibition (KB220) therapy as a 
frontline modality instead of potent opioids."
1220,"OBJECTIVES: This study focuses on identifying variations in selected CYP genes 
related to treatment responses in patients with HIV in African populations by 
investigating variant characteristics and effects in African cohorts.
DESIGN: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A6, 2B6, and Uridine 
5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 allele frequencies were studied 
using public-domain datasets obtained from the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 project, the 
African Genome Variation Project (AGVP), and the South African Human Genome 
Programme (SAHGP).
METHODS: Variant annotations were performed using self-identified ethnicities to 
conduct allele frequency analysis in a population-stratification-sensitive 
manner. The NCBI DB-SNP database was used to identify documented variants and 
standard frequencies, and the E! Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor tool was used 
to perform the prediction of possible deleterious variants.
RESULTS: A total of 4468 variants were identified across 3676 individuals 
following pre-filtering. Seventy-one variants were identified at an allelic 
frequency (1% or more in at least one population), which were predicted to be 
linked to existing disease associations and, in some cases, linked to drug 
metabolisms. This list was further studied to identify 23 alleles with disease 
considerations found at significantly different frequencies in one or more 
populations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes allele frequencies observed in African 
populations at significantly different frequencies relative to at least one 
other reference population and identifies a subset of variants of clinical 
interest. Despite the inclusion of mixed sequence coverage datasets, the 
variants identified pose notable avenues for future inquiries. A subset of 
variants of clinical interest with statistically significant inter-population 
frequency differences was identified for further inspection, which provides 
evidence of an African population-specific variant frequency profile. This study 
highlights the need for additional research and African genetics data given the 
presence of this unique frequency profile to better facilitate the genetic 
pre-screening of patients as a standard of practice in HIV care, particularly on 
the African continent where HIV is highly prevalent."
1221,"Loss of CDH1/Cadherin-1 is a common step towards the acquisition of an abnormal 
epithelial phenotype. In gastric cancer (GC), mutation and/or downregulation of 
CDH1/Cadherin-1 is recurrent in sporadic and hereditary diffuse GC type. To 
approach the molecular events downstream of CDH1/Cadherin-1 alterations and 
their relevance in gastric carcinogenesis, we queried public databases for 
genetic and DNA methylation data in search of molecular signatures with a 
still-uncertain role in the pathological mechanism of GC. In all GC subtypes, 
modulated genes correlating with CDH1/Cadherin-1 aberrations are associated with 
stem cell and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathways. A higher level of 
genes upregulated in CDH1-mutated GC cases is associated with reduced overall 
survival. In the diffuse GC (DGC) subtype, genes downregulated in CDH1-mutated 
compared to cases with wild type CDH1/Cadherin-1 resulted in being strongly 
intertwined with the DREAM complex. The inverse correlation between 
hypermethylated CpGs and CDH1/Cadherin-1 transcription in diverse subtypes 
implies a common epigenetic program. We identified nonredundant protein-encoding 
isoforms of 22 genes among those differentially expressed in GC compared to 
normal stomach. These unique proteins represent potential agents involved in 
cell transformation and candidate therapeutic targets. Meanwhile, drug-induced 
and CDH1/Cadherin-1 mutation-related gene expression comparison predicts FIT, 
GR-127935 hydrochloride, amiodarone hydrochloride in GC and BRD-K55722623, 
BRD-K13169950, and AY 9944 in DGC as the most effective treatments, providing 
cues for the design of combined pharmacological treatments. By integrating 
genetic and epigenetic aspects with their expected functional outcome, we 
unveiled promising targets for combinatorial pharmacological treatments of GC."
1222,"Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) has a poor prognosis, and its therapeutic 
strategy has not been established. PRELP is a leucine-rich repeat protein in the 
extracellular matrix of connective tissues. Although PRELP anchors the basement 
membrane to the connective tissue and is absent in most epithelial cancers, much 
remains unknown regarding its function as a regulator of ligand-mediated 
signaling pathways. Here, we obtained sets of differentially expressed genes by 
PRELP expression using OCCC cell lines. We found that more than 1000 genes were 
significantly altered by PRELP expression, particularly affecting the expression 
of a group of genes involved in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, we 
revealed the loss of active histone marks on the loci of the PRELP gene in 
patients with OCCC and how its forced expression inhibited cell proliferation. 
These findings suggest that PRELP is not only a molecule anchored in connective 
tissues but is also a signaling molecule acting in a tumor-suppressive manner. 
It can serve as the basis for early detection and novel therapeutic approaches 
for OCCC toward precision medicine."
1223,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly lethal malignancy that 
unfortunately cannot benefit from molecularly targeted therapies. Although 
previous results showed the pivotal role of various receptor tyrosine kinases 
(RTKs) in MPM tumorigenesis, the treatment with a single inhibitor targeting one 
specific RTK has been shown to be ineffective in MPM patients. The main aim of 
the present study was to investigate the potential role of AXL and MET receptors 
in MPM and the possible efficacy of treatment with AXL and MET multitarget 
inhibitors. Immunohistochemical and FISH analyses were performed in a wide 
series of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded MPM samples to detect the expression 
of two receptors and the potential gene amplification. In vitro studies were 
performed to evaluate putative correlations between the target's expression and 
the cell sensitivity to AXL-MET multitarget inhibitors. In our series, 10.4% of 
cases showed a co-expression of AXL and MET, regardless of their ligand 
expression, and the gene amplification. Furthermore, our in vitro results 
suggest that the concomitant pharmacological inhibition of AXL and MET may 
affect the proliferative and aggressiveness of MPM cells. In conclusion, the 
subset of MPM patients with AXL-MET co-activation could benefit from treatment 
with specific multitarget inhibitors."
1224,"Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Parkinson's Disease (PD), are a group of heterogeneous diseases that mainly 
affect central nervous system (CNS) functions. A subset of NDDs exhibit CNS 
dysfunction and muscle degeneration, as observed in Gangliosidosis 1 (GM1) and 
late stages of PD. Neuromuscular disorders (NMDs) are a group of diseases in 
which patients show primary progressive muscle weaknesses, including Duchenne 
Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Pompe disease, and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). NDDs 
and NMDs typically have a genetic component, which affects the physiological 
functioning of critical cellular processes, leading to pathogenesis. Currently, 
there is no cure or efficient treatment for most of these diseases. More than 
200 clinical trials have been completed or are currently underway in order to 
establish safety, tolerability, and efficacy of promising gene therapy 
approaches. Thus, gene therapy-based therapeutics, including viral or non-viral 
delivery, are very appealing for the treatment of NDDs and NMDs. In particular, 
adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) are an attractive option for gene therapy 
for NDDs and NMDs. However, limitations have been identified after systemic 
delivery, including the suboptimal capacity of these therapies to traverse the 
blood-brain barrier (BBB), degradation of the particles during the delivery, 
high reactivity of the patient's immune system during the treatment, and the 
potential need for redosing. To circumvent these limitations, several 
preclinical and clinical studies have suggested intrathecal (IT) delivery to 
target the CNS and peripheral organs via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF 
administration can vastly improve the delivery of small molecules and drugs to 
the brain and spinal cord as compared to systemic delivery. Here, we review AAV 
biology and vector design elements, different therapeutic routes of 
administration, and highlight CSF delivery as an attractive route of 
administration. We discuss the different aspects of neuromuscular and 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as pathogenesis, the landscape of mutations, 
and the biological processes associated with the disease. We also describe the 
hallmarks of NDDs and NMDs as well as discuss current therapeutic approaches and 
clinical progress in viral and non-viral gene therapy and enzyme replacement 
strategies for those diseases."
1225,"Spastic type cerebral palsy (CP) is a complex neuromuscular disorder that 
involves altered skeletal muscle microanatomy and growth, but little is known 
about the mechanisms contributing to muscle pathophysiology and dysfunction. 
Traditional genomic approaches have provided limited insight regarding disease 
onset and severity, but recent epigenomic studies indicate that DNA methylation 
patterns can be altered in CP. Here, we examined whether a diagnosis of spastic 
CP is associated with intrinsic DNA methylation differences in myoblasts and 
myotubes derived from muscle resident stem cell populations (satellite cells; 
SCs). Twelve subjects were enrolled (6 CP; 6 control) with informed 
consent/assent. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained during orthopedic 
surgeries, and SCs were isolated and cultured to establish patient-specific 
myoblast cell lines capable of proliferation and differentiation in culture. DNA 
methylation analyses indicated significant differences at 525 individual CpG 
sites in proliferating SC-derived myoblasts (MB) and 1774 CpG sites in 
differentiating SC-derived myotubes (MT). Of these, 79 CpG sites were common in 
both culture types. The distribution of differentially methylated 1 Mbp 
chromosomal segments indicated distinct regional hypo- and hyper-methylation 
patterns, and significant enrichment of differentially methylated sites on 
chromosomes 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, and 20. Average methylation load across 2000 bp 
regions flanking transcriptional start sites was significantly different in 3 
genes in MBs, and 10 genes in MTs. SC derived MBs isolated from study 
participants with spastic CP exhibited fundamental differences in DNA 
methylation compared to controls at multiple levels of organization that may 
reveal new targets for studies of mechanisms contributing to muscle 
dysregulation in spastic CP."
1226,"Utilizing pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing and integrating evidence-based guidance 
in drug therapy enables an improved treatment response and decreases the 
occurrence of adverse drug events. We conducted a retrospective analysis to 
validate the YouScript® PGx interaction probability (PIP) algorithm, which 
predicts patients for whom PGx testing would identify one or more 
evidence-based, actionable drug-gene, drug-drug-gene, or drug-gene-gene 
interactions (EADGIs). PIP scores generated for 36,511 patients were assessed 
according to the results of PGx multigene panel testing. PIP scores versus the 
proportion of patients in whom at least one EADGI was found were 22.4% vs. 22.4% 
(p = 1.000), 23.5% vs. 23.4% (p = 0.6895), 30.9% vs. 29.4% (p = 0.0667), and 
27.3% vs. 26.4% (p = 0.3583) for patients tested with a minimum of 3-, 5-, 14-, 
and 25-gene panels, respectively. These data suggest a striking concordance 
between the PIP scores and the EAGDIs found by gene panel testing. The ability 
to identify patients most likely to benefit from PGx testing has the potential 
to reduce health care costs, enable patient access to personalized medicine, and 
ultimately improve drug efficacy and safety."
1227,"Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by MECP2 gene 
abnormalities, is characterized by atypical EEG activity, and its detailed 
examination is lacking. We combined the comparison of one-time eyes open EEG 
resting state activity from 32 girls with RTT and their 41 typically developing 
peers (age 2-16 years old) with longitudinal following of one girl with RTT to 
reveal EEG parameters which correspond to the RTT progression. Traditional 
measures, such as epileptiform abnormalities, generalized background activity, 
beta activity and the sensorimotor rhythm, were supplemented by a new frequency 
rate index measured as the ratio between high- and low-frequency power of 
sensorimotor rhythm. Almost all studied EEG parameters differentiated the 
groups; however, only the elevated generalized background slowing and decrease 
in our newly introduced frequency rate index which reflects attenuation in the 
proportion of the upper band of sensorimotor rhythm in RTT showed significant 
relation with RTT progression both in longitudinal case and group analysis. 
Moreover, only this novel index was linked to the breathing irregularities RTT 
symptom. The percentage of epileptiform activity was unrelated to RTT severity, 
confirming previous studies. Thus, resting EEG can provide information about the 
pathophysiological changes caused by MECP2 abnormalities and disease 
progression."
1228,"Gliomas are relatively rare but fatal cancers, and there has been insufficient 
research to specifically evaluate the role of headache as a risk factor. 
Nowadays, gliomas are difficult to cure due to the infiltrative nature and the 
absence of specific adjuvant therapies. Until now, mutations in hundreds of 
genes have been identified in gliomas and most relevant discoveries showed 
specific genes alterations related to migraine as potential risk factors for 
brain tumor onset. Prognostic biomarkers are required at the time of diagnosis 
to better adapt therapies for cancer patients. In this review, we aimed to 
highlight the significant modulation of CLOCK, BMLA1 and NOTCH genes in glioma 
onset and development, praising these genes to be good as potentially attractive 
therapeutic markers for brain tumors. A improved knowledge regarding the role of 
these genes in triggering or modulating glioma maybe the key to early diagnosing 
brain tumor onset in patients affected by a simple headache. In addition, 
investigating on these genes we can suggest potential therapeutic targets for 
treating brain tumors. These considerations open up the possibility of 
personalized treatments that can target each brain tumor's specific genetic 
abnormality."
1229,"New methods and demonstrations of feasibility guide future implementation of 
genomic population health screening programs. This is the first report of 
genomic population screening in a primary care, non-research setting using 
existing large carrier and health risk gene sequencing panels combined into one 
432-gene test that is offered to adults of any health status. This report 
summarizes basic demographic data and analyses patterns of pathogenic and likely 
pathogenic genetic findings for the first 300 individuals tested in this 
real-world scenario. We devised a classification system for gene results to 
facilitate clear message development for our Genomic Medicine Action Plan 
messaging tool used to summarize and activate results for patients and primary 
care providers. Potential genetic health risks of various magnitudes for a broad 
range of disorders were identified in 16% to 34% of tested individuals. The 
frequency depends on criteria used for the type and penetrance of risk. 86% of 
individuals are carriers for one or more recessive diseases. Detecting, 
reporting, and guiding response to diverse genetic health risks and recessive 
carrier states in a single primary care genomic screening test appears feasible 
and effective. This is an important step toward exploring an exome or genome 
sequence as a multi-purpose clinical screening tool."
1230,"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a prolonged inflammatory autoimmune 
disease, which is characterized by a high titer of serological autoantibodies. 
Interactions between environmental and genetic factors play a crucial role in 
the pathogenesis of SLE. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes, namely HLA-class 
II genes, are one of the main candidate genes that increase susceptibility to 
SLE. The aim of this study was to investigate, for the first time, the 
association of HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 genes among Jordanian patients diagnosed 
with SLE and Lupus Nephritis (LN) using the Polymerase Chain 
Reaction-Sequence-Specific Primer (PCR-SSP) technique. This study showed that 
SLE is positively associated with DRB1*0301, DRB1*1101, DRB1*1102 and 
HLA-DQB1*0601. Furthermore, HLA-DRB1*0301, DRB1*1101, HLA-DRB1*1501 and 
HLA-DQB1*0601 were found to be linked to SLE patients with LN. In addition, 
haplotypes HLA-DRB1*0301/DQB1*0201 and HLA-DRB1*1501/DQB1*0601 were found to be 
linked to SLE and LN. Our findings may serve as possible predictive markers for 
early screening for LN risk in SLE patients. In light of these results, the role 
of HLA gene polymorphisms may help in understanding the clinical course, 
prognosis of the disease and developing better treatment strategies for SLE 
patients. In addition, it may help in early diagnosis, prevention, intervention 
and management of the disease."
1231,"Despite the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) having partially improved in 
recent years, LUAD patients still have poor prognosis rates. Therefore, it is 
especially important to explore effective biomarkers and exploit novel 
therapeutic developments. High-throughput technologies are widely used as 
systematic approaches to explore differences in expressions of thousands of 
genes for both biological and genomic systems. Recently, using big data analyses 
in biomedicine research by integrating several high-throughput databases and 
tools, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), cBioportal, Oncomine, and 
Kaplan-Meier plotter, is an important strategy to identify novel biomarkers for 
cancer therapy. Here, we used two different comprehensive bioinformatics 
analysis and revealed protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type (PTPN) 
family genes, especially PTPN1 and PTPN22, were downregulated in lung cancer 
tissue in comparison with normal samples. The survival curves indicated that 
LUAD patients with high transcription levels of PTPN5 were significantly 
associated with a good prognosis. Meanwhile, Gene Ontology (GO) and MetaCore 
analyses indicated that co-expression of the PTPN1, PTPN5, and PTPN21 genes was 
significantly enriched in cancer development-related pathways, including GTPase 
activity, regulation of small GTPase-mediated signal transduction, response to 
mechanical stimuli, vasculogenesis, organ morphogenesis, regulation of stress 
fiber assembly, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, cell migration, 
and angiogenesis. Collectively, this study revealed that PTPN family members are 
both significant prognostic biomarkers for lung cancer progression and promising 
clinical therapeutic targets, which provide new targets for treating LUAD 
patients."
1232,"Scientific studies have provided evidence that there is a relationship between 
violent and aggressive behaviors and addictions. Genes involved with the reward 
system, specifically the brain reward cascade (BRC), appear to be associated 
with various addictions and impulsive, aggressive, and violent behaviors. In our 
previous research, we examined the Taq A1 allele (variant D2 dopamine receptor 
gene) and the DAT-40 base repeat (a variant of the dopamine transporter gene) in 
11 Caucasian boys at the Brown School in San Marcus, Texas, diagnosed with 
intermittent explosive disorder. Thirty supernormal controls were screened to 
exclude several reward-deficit behaviors, including pathological violence, and 
genotyped for the DRD2 gene. Additionally, 91 controls were screened to exclude 
ADHD, pathological violence, alcoholism, drug dependence, and tobacco abuse, and 
their results were compared with DAT1 genotype results. In the schoolboys vs. 
supercontrols, there was a significant association with the D2 variant and a 
trend with the dopamine transporter variant. Results support our hypothesis and 
the involvement of at least two gene risk alleles with adolescent 
violent/aggressive behaviors. This study and the research presented in this 
paper suggest that violent/aggressive behaviors are associated with a greater 
risk of addiction, mediated via various genes linked to the BRC. This review 
provides a contributory analysis of how gene polymorphisms, especially those 
related to the brain reward circuitry, are associated with violent behaviors."
1233,"Obesity is a chronic disease in which abnormal deposition of fat threatens 
health, leading to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other chronic 
illnesses. According to the WHO, 19.8% of the adult population in Italy is 
obese, and the prevalence is higher among men. It is important to know the 
predisposition of an individual to become obese and to respond to bariatric 
surgery, the most up-to-date treatment for severe obesity. To this purpose, we 
developed an NGS gene panel, comprising 72 diagnostic genes and 244 candidate 
genes, and we sequenced 247 adult obese Italian patients. Eleven deleterious 
variants in 9 diagnostic genes and 17 deleterious variants in 11 candidate genes 
were identified. Interestingly, mutations were found in several genes correlated 
to the Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Then, 25 patients were clinically followed to 
evaluate their response to bariatric surgery. After a 12-month follow-up, the 
patients that carried deleterious variants in diagnostic or candidate genes had 
a reduced weight loss, as compared to the other patients. The NGS-based panel, 
including diagnostic and candidate genes used in this study, could play a role 
in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing obese individuals, and may help in 
predicting the outcome of bariatric surgery."
1234,"BACKGROUND: Non-syndromic combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) occurs 
due to defects in transcription factors that govern early pituitary development 
and the specification of hormone-producing cells. The most common mutations are 
in the Prophet of Pit-1 (ProP1) gene. This work aims to (1) report findings of 
genetic analyses of Tunisian patients with non-syndromic CPHD and (2) describe 
their phenotype patterns and their evolution through life.
METHODS: Fifteen patients from twelve unrelated families with variable clinical 
phenotypes were included after excluding autoimmune and acquired forms of 
non-syndromic CPHD. Detailed pedigree charts and auxological, hormonal, 
radiological, and therapeutic details were recorded. Sanger sequencing was 
performed, and sequences were analyzed with a specific focus on coding and 
splice site regions of the ProP1 gene. Retained variants were classified using 
several in silico pathogenicity prediction tools and the VarSome platform.
RESULTS: We identified the common p.Arg73Cys mutation in seven patients from 
four unrelated pedigrees. We found a novel homozygous mutation (c.340C&gt;T) in 
one sporadic case. This mutation generates a truncated ProP1 protein, predicted 
to be non-functional, lacking the last 112 codons (p.(Gln114Ter)). We confirmed 
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the absence of large exon deletions or 
insertions in the remaining sporadic patients (7/8).
CONCLUSIONS: We report two mutations {one newly identified [p.(Gln114Ter)] and 
one previously reported (p.Arg73Cys)} in five unrelated Tunisian families with 
non-syndromic CPHD. This work is of clinical importance as it reports the high 
frequency of the p.Arg73Cys mutation in Tunisian CPHD families. Our study also 
illuminated the involvement of novel gene(s) in the emergence of non-syndromic 
CPHD."
1235,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths 
worldwide, and 20% of patients with CRC present at diagnosis with metastases. 
The treatment of metastatic CRC is based on a fluoropyrimidine-based 
chemotherapy plus additional agents such as oxaliplatin and irinotecan. To date, 
on the basis of the molecular background, targeted therapies (e.g., monoclonal 
antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor or inhibiting angiogenesis) 
are administered to improve the treatment of metastatic CRC. In addition, more 
recently, immunological agents emerged as effective in patients with a defective 
mismatch repair system. The administration of targeted therapies and 
immunotherapy lead to a significant increase in the survival of patients; 
however these drugs do not always prove effective. In most cases the lack of 
effectiveness is due to the development of primary resistance, either a 
resistance-inducing factor is already present before treatment or resistance is 
acquired when it occurs after treatment initiation. In this review we describe 
the most relevant targeted therapies and immunotherapies and expand on the 
reasons for resistance to the different approved or under development targeted 
drugs. Then we showed the possible mechanisms and drugs that may lead to 
overcoming the primary or acquired resistance in metastatic CRC."
1236,"Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a hereditary condition 
that can cause sudden cardiac death in young, frequently athletic individuals 
under the age of 35 due to malignant arrhythmias. Competitive and endurance 
exercise may hasten the onset and progression of ARVC, leading to right 
ventricular dysfunction and potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias earlier in 
life. In this article, we present a novel, pathogenic, early truncating 
heterozygous variant in the PKP2 gene that causes biventricular arrhythmogenic 
cardiomyopathy and affects a family, of which the only member with the positive 
phenotype is a competitive endurance athlete."
1237,"Cuproptosis is a newly discovered type of cell death. The role and potential 
mechanism of Cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in the prognosis of cancer 
patients are not fully understood. In this study, we included two cohorts of 
clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients, TCGA and E-MTAB-1980. The TCGA cohort 
is used as a training set to construct a CRG signature using the LASSO-cox 
regression analysis, and E-MTAB-1980 is used as a cohort for verification. A 
total of eight genes (FDX1, LIAS, LIPT1, DLAT, PDHA1, MTF1, GLS, CDKN2A) were 
screened to construct a prognostic model in the TCGA cohort. There is a 
significant difference in OS (p &lt; 0.0001) between the high and low 
cuproptosis score group, and a similar difference is also observed in the OS (p 
= 0.0054) of the E-MTAB-1980 cohort. The area under the ROC curves (AUC) were 
0.87, 0.82, and 0.78 at 1, 3, and 5 years in the TCGA cohort, respectively. 
Finally, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that CRGs were associated with 
cell cycle and mitotic signaling pathways."
1238,"BACKGROUND: There are reports suggesting an association between the rs4994 
polymorphism in the ADRB3 gene encoding the beta-3 adrenergic receptor and OAB 
risk in females. The injection of botulinum toxin-A into the bladder wall is 
recommended as a possible treatment for OAB patients in whom first-line 
therapies have failed. The aim of our study was to analyze the possible 
association between the ADRB3:rs4994 polymorphism and the patient-perceived 
response to a single intra-detrusor injection of botulinum toxin-A in Polish 
women with overactive bladder.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 115 consecutive female patients with OAB. 
The response to botulinum toxin-A was evaluated at three months after injection, 
as absolute or relative reductions in OAB symptoms or in scores from 
questionnaires ICIQ-OAB (parts A and B) and ICIQ-LUTS-QoL (parts A and B). 
ADRB3:rs4994 variants were identified by the sequencing of genomic DNA extracted 
from buccal swabs.
RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between 
ADRB3:rs4994 [T];[T] homozygotes and [T];[C]+[C];[C] subjects for absolute or 
relative reductions in symptoms or in scores from all four questionnaire parts 
at three months after the injection of botulinum toxin-A.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not support the hypothesis that ADRB3:rs4994 
polymorphism is associated with the response to the intra-detrusor injection of 
botulinum toxin-A in Polish females with overactive bladder."
1239,"Interleukin-17A (IL17A) is a proinflammatory cytokine and is assumed to play an 
important role in fetal rejection. In order to evaluate the potential role of 
IL17A polymorphism in the pathogenesis of recurrent miscarriage (RM), serum 
IL17A levels were estimated by ELISA. Single-nucleotide polymorphism was 
assessed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism 
(PCR-RFLP) using gene-specific primers and the EcoNI restriction enzyme. Serum 
IL17A levels were nonsignificantly (p &gt; 0.5) low in RM patients compared with 
the control group. IL17A gene amplification by PCR yielded the undigested 
product of 815 bp, and its digestion with EcoNI enzyme produced 815, 529, 286, 
and 270 bp fragments for the GG genotype; 529, 286, and 270 bp fragments for the 
GA genotype; and 529 and 286 bp fragments for the AA genotype. The genotype 
frequency between the RM and control groups exhibited a significant difference 
(p = 0.001), whereas no significant difference was observed between allele 
frequencies in the two groups (p = 0.0954). These data suggest that the IL17A 
gene polymorphism exhibits no significant effect on IL17A gene expression. 
However, it significantly decreases and increases RM risk in the homozygous and 
recessive models, suggesting its potential pregnancy-protecting and -harming 
roles in the AA and GA + GG genotypes, respectively."
1240,"(1) Background: There are no reliable and widely available markers of functional 
iron deficiency (FID) in cancer. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role 
of transferrin (Tf) as a marker of cancer of the ovary (CrO) and related FID. 
(2) Methods: The study groups consisted of 118 patients with CrO and 69 control 
females. Blood serum iron status was determined on a Beckman Coulter AU (USA) 
analyzer. Tf quantification was performed by immunoturbidimetry. The relative 
contents of apo- and holo-Tf (iron-free and iron-saturated Tf, respectively) 
were determined in eight patients and a control female by immunochromatographic 
analysis based on the use of monoclonal single-domain antibodies (nanobodies). 
(3) Results: Four groups of patients with different iron statuses were selected 
according to ferritin and transferrin saturation values: absolute iron 
deficiency (AID) (n = 42), FID (n = 70), iron overload (n = 4), normal iron 
status (n = 2). The groups differed significantly in Tf values (p &lt; 0.0001). 
Lower values of Tf were associated with FID. Furthermore, FID is already found 
in the initial stages of CrO (26%). Immunosorbents based on nanobodies revealed 
the accumulation of apo-Tf and the decrease in holo-Tf in patients with CrO. (4) 
Conclusions: Tf may be a promising tool for diagnosing both CrO and associated 
FID."
1241,"Klotho is an anti-aging gene. Studies have revealed its association with insulin 
resistance. Visceral fat is related to insulin resistance, and the sagittal 
abdominal diameter (SAD) can serve as a biomarker for visceral fat (VF). This 
study investigated the association between SAD and serum Klotho concentration 
(SKC). We enrolled 2301 participants from the 2011-2012 National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset, and 49.2% of the enrolled 
individuals were male. Qualified participants were separated into four quartiles 
according to the SAD value. SKC values were obtained by ELISA. Demographic 
characteristics, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, and 
biochemistry parameters with significance were analyzed using multivariate 
linear regression models. The mean age of the study participants was 57.22 ± 
10.53 years. The fully adjusted regression model showed a negative association 
between SAD and SKC (p &lt; 0.05), with a β-coefficient of -12.02. We also 
analyzed subgroups of participants according to age and BMI. Participants with 
an age ≥65 and &lt;65 years old were each negatively associated with SKC, and 
this association was significant for participants with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 (p = 
0.001, β-coefficient: -18.83). We also found a concentration-dependent 
relationship between SAD and SKC. In conclusion, VF and SKC are associated, and 
SAD can serve as a surrogate of VF and an indicator of SKC."
1242,"Many epidemiological studies and meta-analyses show that persistent Helicobacter 
pylori infection in the gastric mucosa can lead to iron deficiency or iron 
deficiency anemia (IDA), particularly in certain populations of children and 
adolescents. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that H. pylori infection can 
lead to and be closely associated with recurrent and/or refractory iron 
deficiency and IDA. However, the pathogenesis and specific risk factors leading 
to this clinical outcome in H. pylori-infected children remain poorly 
understood. In general, most of pediatric patients with H. pylori-associated IDA 
do not show evidence of overt blood loss due to gastrointestinal hemorrhagic 
lesions. In adult populations, H. pylori atrophic gastritis is reported to cause 
impaired iron absorption due to impaired gastric acid secretion, which, 
subsequently, results in IDA. However, significant gastric atrophy, and the 
resultant substantial reduction in gastric acid secretion, has not been shown in 
H. pylori-infected children. Recently, it has been hypothesized that competition 
between H. pylori and humans for iron availability in the upper gastrointestinal 
tract could lead to IDA. Many genes, including those encoding major outer 
membrane proteins (OMPs), are known to be involved in iron-uptake mechanisms in 
H. pylori. Recent studies have been published that describe H. pylori virulence 
factors, including specific OMP genes that may be associated with the 
pathogenesis of IDA. Daily iron demand substantively increases in children as 
they begin pubertal development starting with the associated growth spurt, and 
this important physiological mechanism may play a synergistic role for the 
microorganisms as a host pathogenetic factor of IDA. Like in the most recent 
pediatric guidelines, a test-and-treat strategy in H. pylori infection should be 
considered, especially for children and adolescents in whom IDA is recurrent or 
refractory to iron supplementation and other definitive causes have not been 
identified. This review will focus on providing the evidence that supports a 
clear biological plausibility for H. pylori infection and iron deficiency, as 
well as IDA."
1243,"BACKGROUND: Paediatric-onset idiopathic/hereditary pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (IPAH/HPAH) is partially linked to genetic factors that may also 
affect treatment response and outcome. The relation between clinical 
characteristics and pathogenicity of gene variants in childhood IPAH/HPAH is 
still not well understood.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed IPAH/HPAH paediatric patients aged between 
3 months and 18 years under follow-up at a large tertiary referral center. 
Whole-exome sequencing focused on PAH high-risk genes was performed in all 
patients. Pathogenicity grading of gene variant sites was assessed using ClinVar 
and population frequencies. The association between gene variants and death was 
studied using Cox proportional multivariate models.
RESULTS: Overall, 129 patients (54.3% females; 91.5% on PAH therapy) with a 
median age at diagnosis of 6.8 (IQR 3.4-10.7) years were included. A relevant 
PAH gene variant was detected in 95 patients (73.6%). The most common variants 
were in the BMPR2 (n = 43, 3%) gene. Over a median follow-up period of 27.6 
months, 26 children died. The presence of a likely pathogenic genetic variant 
was significantly associated with survival (HR: 3.56, p = 0.005) on 
multivariable Cox analysis. The number of PAH-specific drugs at presentation was 
associated with better survival in the cohort with pathogenic variants (p = 
0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic/likely pathogenic genetic variants are prevalent in 
children with PAH and are related to a worse prognosis irrespective of other 
recognized risk factors in this population. Combination PAH therapy was 
associated with superior prognosis in children with pathogenic variants or BMPR2 
variants. Therefore, proactive medical therapy should be employed in this 
population."
1244,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although the significance of primary congenital 
hypothyroidism (CH) is supported by an increasing amount of evidence, the 
clinical and genetic characteristics of this condition are still poorly 
understood. This study aimed to explore the underlying genetic etiologies in a 
cohort of primary CH patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 33 patients with primary CH were 
collected and analyzed via a cross-sectional study. Genetic analysis was 
performed by high-throughput sequencing and Sanger verification, and the 
pathogenicity of the novel missense variants was predicted using a variety of 
comprehensive bioinformatic tools.
RESULTS: Among the 33 patients, 22 (22/33, 66.7%) harbored pathogenic variants 
in the causative genes of thyroid dysgenesis or dyshormonogenesis, with DUOX2 
(15/33, 45.5%) topping the list, followed by TG, TPO, DUOXA2 and PAX8. Four 
novel genetic variants were detected, including a pathogenic frameshift and 
three likely pathogenic missense variants. Positive neonatal screening for TSH, 
neonatal jaundice and abnormal thyroid morphology were the main positive 
findings among all cases. Although 31 of the total 33 CH patients exhibited 
normal anthropometric and social performance, the other 2 had poor prognosis in 
this study.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reported 33 new CH patients bearing four novel genetic 
variants, which enriched the variant spectrum of CH genes. In this cohort, 
genetic factors causing thyroid dyshormonogenesis were the main etiologies of CH 
development. Most patients exhibited a favorable prognosis; however, systematic 
management remains a challenge in achieving improved clinical outcomes for CH 
patients."
1245,"BACKGROUND: We explored whether there are splice variants (SVs) of peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG) in polycystic ovary syndrome 
(PCOS) patients and its relationship with clinical features and KGN cell 
functions.
METHODS: We performed a study involving 153 women with PCOS and 153 age-matched 
controls. One type of PPARG SV was detected by SMARTer RACE. The correlations 
between PPARG SV expression levels, clinical features, and KGN cell functions 
were analyzed. The effect of the PPARG SV on the expression of important genes 
in metabolism-related pathways was explored by PCR array.
RESULTS: The expression of the PPARG SV in PCOS patients was significantly 
higher than that in the controls. Clinical features were more significant in the 
PCOS group with the SV. Compared with overexpression of PPARG, the 
overexpression of the PPARG SV inhibited the proliferation, migration, and 
apoptosis of KGN cells in vitro. The genes related to the PPARG SV were mainly 
involved in lipid metabolism.
CONCLUSION: While granulosa cells contribute greatly to the development of 
follicles, our results suggest that the identified PPARG SV may regulate cell 
proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in granulosa cells, which could 
partially explain the mechanisms of ovulation dysfunction in PCOS. Further 
investigation of the utility of this PPARG SV as a biomarker for PCOS is 
warranted."
1246,"Head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCCs) represent a diverse group of tumors 
emerging within different mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, nasopharynx, 
oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx. HNSCCs share common clinical risk factors 
and genomic features, including smoking, alcohol, age, male sex, aneuploidy, and 
TP53 mutations. Viral initiating and contributing events are increasingly 
recognized in HNSCCs. While both Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and human papilloma 
virus (HPV) are observed, EBV is more frequently associated with nasopharyngeal 
cancers whereas HPV is associated with oropharyngeal cancers. HNSCCs are 
associated with high tumor mutational burden and loss of tumor suppressor gene 
function, especially in TP53 and X-linked genes. Multiple lines of evidence 
suggest that HNSCCs are subject to immunologic surveillance and immune-induced 
evolutionary pressure that correlate with negative clinical outcomes. This 
review will discuss genomic mechanisms related to immune-mediated pressures and 
propose prognostic and therapeutic implications of detectable immune escape 
mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis and disease progression."
1247,"BACKGROUND: The nuclear factor-κB transcription factors 1 and 2 (NFKB1 and 
NFKB2) are key components of the NF-κB pathway, which responds to inflammatory 
signals. Since the NFKB1/2 factors are activated via different inflammatory 
molecules, we aimed to check their expression levels in penile cancer (PC), 
penile dermatoses: lichen sclerosus (PLS) and zoon balanitis (ZB).
METHODS: Skin biopsies from altered and healthy looking foreskin were obtained 
from 59 (49 LS; early PLS: 13, moderate PLS: 32, severe PLS: 4; 6 PC; 4 ZB) and 
unchanged foreskin from 13 healthy control adult males undergoing circumcision. 
NFKB1/2 mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR.
RESULTS: The highest levels of NFKB1 and NFKB2 were observed in PC, ca. 22 and 
3.5 times higher than in control, respectively. NFKB1 expression was correlated 
with PLS progression (rs = 0.667) and was ca. 20 times higher in advanced PLS 
than in controls and early PLS. Occurrence of micro-incontinence was associated 
with elevated NFKB1 levels in PLS.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study regarding gene profiles of NFKB1/2 in PC and 
penile dermatoses. New drugs targeting modulation of canonical-activated NF-κB 
pathway should be studied and introduced to the treatment of PLS and PC apart 
from other treatments."
1248,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease that progressively annihilates 
spinal cord motor neurons, causing severe motor decline and death. The disease 
is divided into familial and sporadic ALS. Mutations in the TAR DNA binding 
protein 43 (TDP-43) have been involved in the pathological emergence and 
progression of ALS, although the molecular mechanisms eliciting the disease are 
unknown. Transposable elements (TEs) and DNA sequences capable of transposing 
within the genome become dysregulated and transcribed in the presence of TDP-43 
mutations. We performed RNA-Seq in human motor neurons (iMNs) derived from 
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from TDP-43 wild-type-iMNs-TDP-43WT-and 
mutant-iMNs-TDP-43M337V-genotypes at 7 and 14 DIV, and, with state-of-the-art 
bioinformatic tools, analyzed whether TDP-43M337V alters both gene expression 
and TE activity. Our results show that TDP-43M337V induced global changes in the 
gene expression and TEs levels at all in vitro stages studied. Interestingly, 
many genetic pathways overlapped with that of the TEs activity, suggesting that 
TEs control the expression of several genes. TEs correlated with genes that 
played key roles in the extracellular matrix and RNA processing: all the 
regulatory pathways affected in ALS. Thus, the loss of TE regulation is present 
in TDP-43 mutations and is a critical determinant of the disease in human motor 
neurons. Overall, our results support the evidence that indicates TEs are 
critical regulatory sequences contributing to ALS neurodegeneration."
1249,"Finfish production has seen over three-fold increase in the past 30 years 
(1990-2020), and Atlantic salmon (A. salmon; salmo salar) accounted for 
approximately 32.6% of the total marine and coastal aquaculture of all finfish 
species in the year 2020, making it one of the most profitable farmed fish 
species globally. This growth in production is, however, threatened by a number 
of problems which can be solved using the CRISPR/Cas technology. In vitro 
applications of CRISPR/Cas using cell lines can complement its in vivo 
applications, but salmonids-derived cell lines are difficult to gene edit 
because they grow slowly, are difficult to transfect and isolate single clones 
of gene-edited cells. While clonal isolation of the gene-edited Chinook salmon 
cell line (CHSE-214) has successfully been performed, there is no report of 
successful clonal isolation of the gene-edited A. salmon ASK-1 and SHK-1cell 
lines. In the current study, two gene loci-cr2 and mmp9 of A. salmon-were 
efficiently edited using the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and plasmid CRISPR/Cas9 
strategies. Edited cells were enriched using flow cytometer-activated cell 
sorting (FACS), followed by clonal isolation and expansion of edited cells. The 
study both confirms the recent report of the highly efficient editing of these 
widely used model cell lines, as well as extends the frontline in the 
single-cell cloning of gene-edited salmonids cells. The report also highlights 
the pitfalls and future directions in the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in these 
cells."
1250,"Tetranychus urticae Koch (T. urticae) is one of the most tremendous herbivores 
due to its polyphagous characteristics, and is resistant to most acaricides. In 
this study, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), transcriptome sequencing 
(RNA-seq) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were carried out to analyze 
the mechanisms of T. urticae metabolic resistance to cyflumetofen and bifenthrin 
on cowpea. The enzyme activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and 
carboxylesterases (CarEs) in the cyflumetofen-resistant (R_cfm) strain 
significantly decreased, while that of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) 
significantly increased. Meanwhile, the activities of glutathione-S-transferases 
(GSTs), CarEs and P450s in the bifenthrin-resistant (R_bft) strain were 
significantly higher than those in the susceptible strain (Lab_SS). According to 
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) 
analyses, in the R_cfm mite strain, two carboxyl/cholinesterase (CCE) genes and 
two P450 genes were upregulated and one gene was downregulated, namely CYP392E7; 
in the R_bft mite strain, eleven CCE, nine UGT, two P450, four GST and three ABC 
genes were upregulated, while four CCE and three P450 genes were downregulated. 
Additionally, 94 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were common to the two 
resistant groups. Specifically, TuCCE46 and TuCCE70 were upregulated in both 
resistant groups. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR validation data were consistent with 
those from the transcriptome sequencing analysis. Specifically, TuCCE46 
(3.37-fold) was significantly upregulated in the R_cfm strain, while in the 
R_bft strain, TeturUGT22 (5.29-fold), teturUGT58p (1.74-fold), CYP392A11 
(2.89-fold) and TuGSTd15 (5.12-fold) were significantly upregulated and TuCCE01 
(0.13-fold) and CYP392A2p (0.07-fold) were significantly downregulated. Our 
study indicates that TuCCE46 might play the most important role in resistance to 
cyflumetofen, and TuCCE01, teturUGT58p, teturUGT22, CYP392A11, TuGSTd15, 
TuGSTm09 and TuABCG-13 were prominent in the resistance to bifenthrin. These 
findings provide further insight into the critical genes involved in the 
metabolic resistance of T. urticae to cyflumetofen and bifenthrin."
1251,"Living organisms do not disregard the laws of thermodynamics and must therefore 
consume energy for their survival. In this way, cellular energy exchanges, which 
aim above all at the production of ATP, a fundamental molecule used by the cell 
for its metabolisms, favor the formation of waste products that, if not properly 
disposed of, can contribute to cellular aging and damage. Numerous genes have 
been linked to aging, with some favoring it (gerontogenes) and others blocking 
it (longevity pathways). Animal model studies have shown that calorie 
restriction (CR) may promote longevity pathways, but given the difficult 
application of CR in humans, research is investigating the use of CR-mimetic 
substances capable of producing the same effect. These include some 
phytonutrients such as oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, epigallo-catechin-gallate, 
fisetin, quercetin, and curcumin and minerals such as magnesium and selenium. 
Some of them also have senolytic effects, which promote the apoptosis of 
defective cells that accumulate over the years (senescent cells) and disrupt 
normal metabolism. In this article, we review the properties of these natural 
elements that can promote a longer and healthier life."
1252,"Radiation-Induced CardioVascular Disease (RICVD) is an important concern in 
thoracic radiotherapy with complex underlying pathophysiology. Recently, we 
proposed DNA methylation as a possible mechanism contributing to RICVD. The 
current study investigates DNA methylation in heart-irradiated rats and 
radiotherapy-treated breast cancer (BC) patients. Rats received fractionated 
whole heart X-irradiation (0, 0.92, 6.9 and 27.6 Gy total doses) and blood was 
collected after 1.5, 3, 7 and 12 months. Global and gene-specific methylation of 
the samples were evaluated; and gene expression of selected differentially 
methylated regions (DMRs) was validated in rat and BC patient blood. In rats 
receiving an absorbed dose of 27.6 Gy, DNA methylation alterations were detected 
up to 7 months with differential expression of cardiac-relevant DMRs. Of those, 
SLMAP showed increased expression at 1.5 months, which correlated with 
hypomethylation. Furthermore, E2F6 inversely correlated with a decreased global 
longitudinal strain. In BC patients, E2F6 and SLMAP exhibited differential 
expression directly and 6 months after radiotherapy, respectively. This study 
describes a systemic radiation fingerprint at the DNA methylation level, 
elucidating a possible association of DNA methylation to RICVD pathophysiology, 
to be validated in future mechanistic studies."
1253,"The maternally transmitted endocellular bacteria Wolbachia is a well-known 
symbiont of insects, demonstrating both negative and positive effects on host 
fitness. The previously found Wolbachia strain wMelPlus is characterized by a 
positive effect on the stress-resistance of its host Drosophila melanogaster, 
under heat stress conditions. This investigation is dedicated to studying the 
genomic underpinnings of such an effect. We sequenced two closely related 
Wolbachia strains, wMelPlus and wMelCS112, assembled their complete genomes, and 
performed comparative genomic analysis engaging available Wolbachia genomes from 
the wMel and wMelCS groups. Despite the two strains under study sharing very 
close gene-composition, we discovered a large (&gt;1/6 of total genome) 
chromosomal inversion in wMelPlus, spanning through the region that includes the 
area of the inversion earlier found in the wMel group of Wolbachia genotypes. A 
number of genes in unique inversion blocks of wMelPlus were identified that 
might be involved in the induction of a stress-resistant phenotype in the host. 
We hypothesize that such an inversion could rearrange established genetic 
regulatory-networks, causing the observed effects of such a complex fly 
phenotype as a modulation of heat stress resistance. Based on our findings, we 
propose that wMelPlus be distinguished as a separate genotype of the wMelCS 
group, named wMelCS3."
1254,"Uncovering the risk factors for acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2019 
(COVID-19) severity may help to provide a valuable tool for early patient 
stratification and proper treatment implementation, improving the patient 
outcome and lowering the burden on the healthcare system. Here we report the 
results of a single-center retrospective cohort study on 151 severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected symptomatic 
hospitalized adult patients. We assessed the association of several blood test 
measurements, soluble urokinase receptor (uPAR) serum level and specific single 
nucleotide polymorphisms of ACE (I/D), NOS3 (rs2070744, rs1799983), SERPINE1 
(rs1799768), PLAU (rs2227564) and PLAUR (rs344781, rs2302524) genes, with the 
disease severity classified by the percentage of lung involvement on 
computerized tomography scans. Our findings reveal that the T/C genotype of 
PLAUR rs2302524 was independently associated with a less severe lung damage 
(odds ratio 0.258 [0.071-0.811]). Along with high C-reactive protein, fibrinogen 
and soluble uPAR serum levels turned out to be independently associated with 
more severe lung damage in COVID-19 patients. The identified factors may be 
further employed as predictors of a possibly severe COVID-19 clinical course."
1255,"The plant cuticle is the outermost layer of the aerial organs and an important 
barrier against biotic and abiotic stresses. The climate varies greatly between 
the north and south of China, with large differences in temperature and 
humidity, but Chinese chestnut is found in both regions. This study investigated 
the relationship between the wax layer of chestnut leaves and environmental 
adaptation. Firstly, semi-thin sections were used to verify that there is a 
significant difference in the thickness of the epicuticular wax layer between 
wild chestnut leaves in northwest and southeast China. Secondly, a whole-genome 
selective sweep was used to resequence wild chestnut samples from two typical 
regional populations, and significant genetic divergence was identified between 
the two populations in the CmCER1-1, CmCER1-5 and CmCER3 genes. Thirty-four CER 
genes were identified in the whole chestnut genome, and a series of predictive 
analyses were performed on the identified CmCER genes. The expression patterns 
of CmCER genes were classified into three trends-upregulation, upregulation 
followed by downregulation and continuous downregulation-when chestnut seedlings 
were treated with drought stress. Analysis of cultivars from two resource beds 
in Beijing and Liyang showed that the wax layer of the northern variety was 
thicker than that of the southern variety. For the Y-2 (Castanea mollissima 
genome sequencing material) cultivar, there were significant differences in the 
expression of CmCER1-1, CmCER1-5 and CmCER3 between the southern variety and the 
northern one-year-grafted variety. Therefore, this study suggests that the CER 
family genes play a role in environmental adaptations in chestnut, laying the 
foundation for further exploration of CmCER genes. It also demonstrates the 
importance of studying the adaptation of Chinese chestnut wax biosynthesis to 
the southern and northern environments."
1256,"Emerging observational evidence suggests links between cognitive impairment and 
a range of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) disorders; however, the mechanisms 
underlying their relationships remain unclear. Leveraging large-scale 
genome-wide association studies' summary statistics, we comprehensively assessed 
genetic overlap and potential causality of cognitive traits and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) with several GIT disorders. We demonstrate a strong and highly 
significant inverse global genetic correlation between cognitive traits and GIT 
disorders-peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastritis-duodenitis, diverticulosis, 
irritable bowel syndrome, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but not 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Further analysis detects 35 significant (p 
&lt; 4.37 × 10-5) bivariate local genetic correlations between cognitive traits, 
AD, and GIT disorders (including IBD). Mendelian randomisation analysis suggests 
a risk-decreasing causality of educational attainment, intelligence, and other 
cognitive traits on PUD and GERD, but not IBD, and a putative association of 
GERD with cognitive function decline. Gene-based analysis reveals a significant 
gene-level genetic overlap of cognitive traits with AD and GIT disorders (IBD 
inclusive, pbinomial-test = 1.18 × 10-3-2.20 × 10-16). Our study supports the 
protective roles of genetically-influenced educational attainments and other 
cognitive traits on the risk of GIT disorders and highlights a putative 
association of GERD with cognitive function decline. Findings from local genetic 
correlation analysis provide novel insights, indicating that the relationship of 
IBD with cognitive traits (and AD) will depend largely on their local effects 
across the genome."
1257,"The adzuki bean Vigna angularis (Wild.) is an important leguminous crop 
cultivated mainly for food purposes in Asian countries; it represents a source 
of carbohydrates, digestible proteins, minerals, and vitamins. Aquaporins (AQPs) 
are crucial membrane proteins involved in the transmembrane diffusion of water 
and small solutes in all living organisms, including plants. In this study, we 
used the whole genome sequence of the adzuki bean for in silico analysis to 
comprehensively identify 40 Vigna angularis aquaporin (VaAQP) genes and reveal 
how these plants react to drought stress. VaAQPs were compared with AQPs from 
other closely-related leguminous plants, and the results showed that mustard 
(Brassica rapa) (59), barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) (46), soybean (Glycine 
max) (66), and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (41) had more AQP genes. 
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that forty VaAQPs belong to five subfamilies, 
with the VaPIPs (fifteen) subfamily the largest, followed by the VaNIPs (ten), 
VaTIPs (ten), VaSIPs (three), and VaXIPs (two) subfamilies. Furthermore, all AQP 
subcellular locations were found at the plasma membrane, and intron-exon 
analysis revealed a relationship between the intron number and gene expression, 
duplication, evolution, and diversity. Among the six motifs identified, motifs 
one, two, five, and six were prevalent in VaTIP, VaNIP, VaPIP, and VaXIP, while 
motifs one, three, and four were not observed in VaPIP1-3 and VaPIP1-4. Under 
drought stress, two of the VaAQPs (VaPIP2-1 and VaPIP2-5) showed significantly 
higher expression in the root tissue while the other two genes (VaPIP1-1 and 
VaPIP1-7) displayed variable expression in leaf tissue. This finding revealed 
that the selected VaAQPs might have unique molecular functions linked with the 
uptake of water under drought stress or in the exertion of osmoregulation to 
transport particular substrates rather than water to protect plants from 
drought. This study presents the first thorough investigation of VaAQPs in 
adzuki beans, and it reveals the transport mechanisms and related physiological 
processes that may be utilized for the development of drought-tolerant adzuki 
bean cultivars."
1258,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) 
are associated with autosomal-dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Most mutations have been identified in the PSEN1 gene. We discovered a PSEN1 
mutation (Tyr389His) in a Korean patient with early-onset AD who presented 
memory decline at 41 years of age followed by language, memory, and visuospatial 
dysfunctions. As this is the third such patient identified in Korea, this 
mutation may be involved in AD pathogenesis, suggesting that routine screening 
is necessary in this population. Altered intra-molecular interactions with the 
mutated amino acid may result in the destabilization of γ-secretase. In the 
future, a panel incorporating genes with relatively high-frequency rare 
variants, along with the APOE4 gene, may predict the onset of AD and facilitate 
customized treatment."
1259,"Neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the progression of neurodegenerative 
disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). Glial cell activation and 
subsequent adaptive immune involvement are neuroinflammatory features in 
familial and idiopathic PD, resulting in the death of dopaminergic neuron cells. 
An oxidative stress response, inflammatory mediator production, and immune cell 
recruitment and activation are all hallmarks of this activation, leading to 
chronic neuroinflammation and progressive neurodegeneration. Several studies in 
PD patients' cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood revealed alterations in 
inflammatory markers and immune cell populations that may lead to or exacerbate 
neuroinflammation and perpetuate the neurodegenerative process. Most of the 
genes causing PD are also expressed in astrocytes and microglia, converting 
their neuroprotective role into a pathogenic one and contributing to disease 
onset and progression. Nuclear receptor-related transcription factor 1 (NURR1) 
regulates gene expression linked to dopaminergic neuron genesis and functional 
maintenance. In addition to playing a key role in developing and maintaining 
neurotransmitter phenotypes in dopaminergic neurons, NURR1 agonists have been 
shown to reverse behavioral and histological abnormalities in animal PD models. 
NURR1 protects dopaminergic neurons from inflammation-induced degeneration, 
specifically attenuating neuronal death by suppressing the expression of 
inflammatory genes in microglia and astrocytes. This narrative review highlights 
the inflammatory changes in PD and the advances in NURR1-regulated 
neuroinflammation associated with PD. Further, we present new evidence that 
targeting this inflammation with a variety of potential NURR1 target therapy 
medications can effectively slow the progression of chronic 
neuroinflammation-induced PD."
1260,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important plant hormone that regulates numerous 
functions in plant growth, development, and stress responses. Several proteins 
regulate the ABA signal transduction mechanism in response to environmental 
stress. Among them, the PYR1/PYL/RCAR family act as ABA receptors. This study 
used the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system with a single gRNA to knock out three 
soybean PYL genes: GmPYL17, GmPYL18, and GmPYL19. The gRNA may efficiently cause 
varying degrees of deletion of GmPYL17, GmPYL18, and GmPYL19 gene target 
sequences, according to the genotyping results of T0 plants. A subset of induced 
alleles was successfully transferred to progeny. In the T2 generation, we 
obtained double and triple mutant genotypes. At the seed germination stage, 
CRISPR/Cas9-created GmPYL gene knockout mutants, particularly gmpyl17/19 double 
mutants, are less susceptible to ABA than the wild type. RNA-Seq was used to 
investigate the differentially expressed genes related to the ABA response from 
germinated seedlings under diverse treatments using three biological replicates. 
The gmpyl17/19-1 double mutant was less susceptible to ABA during seed 
germination, and mutant plant height and branch number were higher than the wild 
type. Under ABA stress, the GO enrichment analysis showed that certain positive 
germination regulators were activated, which reduced ABA sensitivity and 
enhanced seed germination. This research gives a theoretical basis for a better 
understanding of the ABA signaling pathway and the participation of the key 
component at their molecular level, which helps enhance soybean abiotic stress 
tolerance. Furthermore, this research will aid breeders in regulating and 
improving soybean production and quality under various stress conditions."
1261,"Steroids are abundant molecules in nature, and various microorganisms evolved to 
utilize steroids. Thermophilic actinobacteria play an important role in such 
processes. However, very few thermophiles have so far been reported capable of 
degrading or modifying natural sterols. Recently, genes putatively involved in 
the sterol catabolic pathway have been revealed in the moderately thermophilic 
actinobacterium Saccharopolyspora hirsuta VKM Ac-666T, but peculiarities of 
strain activity toward sterols are still poorly understood. S. hirsuta catalyzed 
cholesterol bioconversion at a rate significantly inferior to that observed for 
mesophilic actinobacteria (mycobacteria and rhodococci). Several genes related 
to different stages of steroid catabolism increased their expression in response 
to cholesterol as was shown by transcriptomic studies and verified by RT-qPCR. 
Sequential activation of genes related to the initial step of cholesterol side 
chain oxidation (cyp125) and later steps of steroid core degradation (kstD3, 
kshA, ipdF, and fadE30) was demonstrated for the first time. The activation 
correlates with a low cholesterol conversion rate and intermediate accumulation 
by the strain. The transcriptomic analyses revealed that the genes involved in 
sterol catabolism are linked functionally, but not transcriptionally. The 
results contribute to the knowledge on steroid catabolism in thermophilic 
actinobacteria and could be used at the engineering of microbial catalysts."
1262,"We report a case of a patient with Dubin-Johnson syndrome confirmed by a genetic 
study. A 50-year-old woman who had symptoms of intermittent right upper quadrant 
abdominal pain was diagnosed with calculous cholecystitis at another institute 
and was presented to our hospital for a cholecystectomy. She had no history of 
liver disease, and her physical examination was normal. Abdominal computed 
tomography showed a gallbladder stone with chronic cholecystitis. During a 
laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystitis, a smooth, black-colored liver 
was noted, and a liver biopsy was performed. The biopsy specimen showed coarse, 
dark brown granules in centrilobular hepatocytes via hematoxylin and eosin 
staining. We performed a genetic study using the blood samples of the patient. 
In the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily C member 2 (ABCC2) 
mutation study, a missense mutation in exon 18 was noted. Based on the 
black-colored liver without nodularity, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, the liver 
biopsy results of the coarse pigment in centrilobular hepatocytes, and the ABCC2 
mutation, Dubin-Johnson syndrome was diagnosed. The patient was managed with 
conservative care using hepatotonics. One month after follow-up, total bilirubin 
and direct bilirubin remained in a similar range. Another follow-up was planned 
a month later, and the patient maintained her use of hepatotonics."
1263,"Phytochelatins (PCs) are class III metallothioneins in plants. They are low 
molecular-weight polypeptides rich in cysteine residues which can bind to metal 
ions and affect the physiological metabolism in plants. Unlike other types of 
metallothioneins, PCs are not the product of gene coding but are synthesized by 
phytochelatin synthase (PCS) based on glutathione (GSH). The chemical formula of 
phytochelatin is a mixture of (γ-Glu-Cys)n-Gly (n = 2-11) and is influenced by 
many factors during synthesis. Phytochelatin-like (PCL) is a gene-encoded 
peptide (Met-(α-Glu-Cys)11-Gly) designed by our laboratory whose amino acid 
sequence mimics that of a natural phytochelatin. This study investigated how PCL 
expression in transgenic plants affects resistance to Cd and Cd accumulation. 
Under Cd2+ stress, transgenic plants were proven to perform significantly better 
than the wild-type (WT), regarding morphological traits and antioxidant 
abilities, but accumulated Cd to higher levels, notably in the roots. 
Fluorescence microscopy showed that PCL localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus."
1264,"Endoplasmic reticulum stress activates inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) and 
protein kinase, R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), the two principal 
regulators of the unfolded protein response (UPR). In multiple myeloma, adaptive 
IRE1α signaling is predominantly activated and regulates cell fate along with 
PERK. Recently, we demonstrated that GNF-2, an allosteric c-Abl inhibitor, 
rheostatically enhanced IRE1α activity and induced apoptosis through c-Abl 
conformational changes in pancreatic β cells. Herein, we analyzed whether the 
pharmacological modulation of c-Abl conformation resulted in anti-myeloma 
effects. First, we investigated the effects of GNF-2 on IRE1α activity and cell 
fate, followed by an investigation of the anti-myeloma effects of asciminib, a 
new allosteric c-Abl inhibitor. Finally, we performed RNA sequencing to 
characterize the signaling profiles of asciminib. We observed that both GNF-2 
and asciminib decreased cell viability and induced XBP1 mRNA splicing in primary 
human myeloma cells and myeloma cell lines. RNA sequencing identified the 
induction of UPR- and apoptosis-related genes by asciminib. Asciminib 
re-localized c-Abl to the endoplasmic reticulum, and its combination with a 
specific IRE1α inhibitor, KIRA8, enhanced cell death with the reciprocal 
induction of CHOP mRNA expression. Together, the allosteric inhibition of 
c-Abl-activated UPR with anti-myeloma effects; this could be a novel therapeutic 
target for multiple myeloma."
1265,"The aim of the present study is to determine how electroretinographic (ERG) 
responses reflect age-related disease progression in the Stargardt disease 
(STGD1). The prospective comparative cohort study included 8 patients harboring 
two null ABCA4 variants (Group 1) and 34 patients with other ABCA4 genotypes 
(Group 2). Age at exam, age at onset, visual acuity (VA) and ERG responses were 
evaluated. The correlation between ERG responses and age in each patient group 
was determined using linear regression. A Mann-Whitney U Test was used to 
compare the median values between the groups. Age of onset was significantly 
earlier in Group 1 than in Group 2 (8 vs. 18), while disease duration was 
similar (13 vs. 12 years, i.e., advanced stage). Group 1 had significantly worse 
VA and lower ERG responses. ERG responses that significantly correlated with age 
in Group 1 were DA 0.01 and 3.0 ERG, which represented a retinal rod system 
response. The only ERG response that significantly correlated with age in Group 
2 was the S-cone ERG. The observed difference was likely due to early cone loss 
occurring in double-null patients and slower photoreceptor loss in patients with 
other genotypes. The results suggest that specific ERG responses may be used to 
detect double-null patients at an early stage and monitor STGD1 disease 
progression in patients with specific genotypes."
1266,"Controlled ovarian stimulation is a necessary step in some assisted reproductive 
procedures allowing a higher collection of female gametes. However, consequences 
of this stimulation for the gamete or the offspring have been shown in several 
mammals. Most studies used comparisons between oocytes from different donors, 
which may contribute to different responses. In this work, we use the bovine 
model in which each animal serves as its own control. DNA methylation profiles 
were obtained by single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of oocytes from 
pre-ovulatory unstimulated follicles compared to oocytes from stimulated 
follicles. Results show that the global percentage of methylation was similar 
between groups, but the percentage of methylation was lower for non-stimulated 
oocytes in the imprinted genes APEG3, MEG3, and MEG9 and higher in TSSC4 when 
compared to stimulated oocytes. Differences were also found in CGI of imprinted 
genes: higher methylation was found among non-stimulated oocytes in MEST (PEG1), 
IGF2R, GNAS&amp;nbsp;(SCG6), KvDMR1 ICR UMD, and IGF2. In another region around 
IGF2, the methylation percentage was lower for non-stimulated oocytes when 
compared to stimulated oocytes. Data drawn from this study might help to 
understand the molecular reasons for the appearance of certain syndromes in 
assisted reproductive technologies-derived offspring."
1267,"Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecules 
that act in post-transcriptional regulation in animals and plants. A mature 
miRNA is the end product of consecutive, highly regulated processing steps of 
the primary miRNA transcript. Following base-paring of the mature miRNA with its 
mRNA target, translation is inhibited, and the targeted mRNA is degraded. There 
are hundreds of miRNAs in each cell that work together to regulate cellular key 
processes, including development, differentiation, cell cycle, apoptosis, 
inflammation, viral infection, and more. In this review, we present an 
overlooked layer of cellular regulation that addresses cell dynamics affecting 
miRNA accessibility. We discuss the regulation of miRNA local storage and 
translocation among cell compartments. The local amounts of the miRNAs and their 
targets dictate their actual availability, which determines the ability to 
fine-tune cell responses to abrupt or chronic changes. We emphasize that changes 
in miRNA storage and compactization occur under induced stress and changing 
conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate shared principles on cell physiology, 
governed by miRNA under oxidative stress, tumorigenesis, viral infection, or 
synaptic plasticity. The evidence presented in this review article highlights 
the importance of spatial and temporal miRNA regulation for cell physiology. We 
argue that limiting the research to mature miRNAs within the cytosol undermines 
our understanding of the efficacy of miRNAs to regulate cell fate under stress 
conditions."
1268,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a malignancy that is becoming increasingly common in 
adolescents. OS stem cells (OSCs) form a dynamic subset of OS cells that are 
responsible for malignant progression and chemoradiotherapy resistance. The 
unique properties of OSCs, including self-renewal, multilineage differentiation 
and metastatic potential, 149 depend closely on their tumor microenvironment. In 
recent years, the likelihood of its dynamic plasticity has been extensively 
studied. Importantly, the tumor microenvironment appears to act as the main 
regulatory component of OS cell plasticity. For these reasons aforementioned, 
novel strategies for OS treatment focusing on modulating OS cell plasticity and 
the possibility of modulating the composition of the tumor microenvironment are 
currently being explored. In this paper, we review recent studies describing the 
phenomenon of OSCs and factors known to influence phenotypic plasticity. The 
microenvironment, which can regulate OSC plasticity, has great potential for 
clinical exploitation and provides different perspectives for drug and treatment 
design for OS."
1269,"Neuritic plaques are one of the major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's 
disease. They are formed by the aggregation of extracellular amyloid-β protein 
(Aβ), which is derived from the sequential cleavage of amyloid-β precursor 
protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretase. BACE1 is the main β-secretase in the 
pathogenic process of Alzheimer's disease, which is believed to be a 
rate-limiting step of Aβ production. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the active center of 
the γ-secretase that participates in the APP hydrolysis process. Mutations in 
the PS1 gene (PSEN1) are the most common cause of early onset familial 
Alzheimer's disease (FAD). The PSEN1 mutations can alter the activity of 
γ-secretase on the cleavage of APP. Previous studies have shown that PSEN1 
mutations increase the expression and activity of BACE1 and that BACE1 
expression and activity are elevated in the brains of PSEN1 mutant knock-in 
mice, compared with wild-type mice, as well as in the cerebral cortex of FAD 
patients carrying PSEN1 mutations, compared with sporadic AD patients and 
controls. Here, we used a Psen1 knockout cell line and a PS1 inhibitor to show 
that PS1 affects the expression of BACE1 in vitro. Furthermore, we used sucrose 
gradient fractionation combined with western blotting to analyze the 
distribution of BACE1, combined with a time-lapse technique to show that PS1 
upregulates the distribution and trafficking of BACE1 in the endoplasmic 
reticulum, Golgi, and endosomes. More importantly, we found that the PSEN1 
mutant S170F increases the distribution of BACE1 in the endoplasmic reticulum 
and changes the ratio of mature BACE1 in the trans-Golgi network. The effect of 
PSEN1 mutations on BACE1 may contribute to determining the phenotype of early 
onset FAD."
1270,"Proteasome is a large proteolytic complex that consists of a 20S core particle 
(20SP) and 19S regulatory particle (19SP) in eukaryotes. The proteasome degrades 
most cellular proteins, thereby controlling many key processes, including gene 
expression and protein quality control. Proteasome dysfunction in plants leads 
to abnormal development and reduced adaptability to environmental stresses. 
Previous studies have shown that proteasome dysfunction upregulates the gene 
expression of proteasome subunits, which is known as the proteasome bounce-back 
response. However, the proteasome bounce-back response cannot explain the 
damaging effect of proteasome dysfunction on plant growth and stress adaptation. 
To address this question, we focused on downregulated genes caused by proteasome 
dysfunction. We first confirmed that the 20SP subunit PBE is an essential 
proteasome subunit in Arabidopsis and that PBE1 mutation impaired the function 
of the proteasome. Transcriptome analyses showed that hypoxia-responsive genes 
were greatly enriched in the downregulated genes in pbe1 mutants. Furthermore, 
we found that the pbe1 mutant is hypersensitive to waterlogging stress, a 
typical hypoxic condition, and hypoxia-related developments are impaired in the 
pbe1 mutant. Meanwhile, the 19SP subunit rpn1a mutant seedlings are also 
hypersensitive to waterlogging stress. In summary, our results suggested that 
proteasome dysfunction downregulated the hypoxia-responsive pathway and impaired 
plant growth and adaptability to hypoxia stress."
1271,"Saline-alkali soil has posed challenges to the growth of agricultural crops, 
while polyploidy often show greater adaptability in diverse and extreme 
environments including saline-alkali stress, but its defense mechanisms in rice 
remain elusive. Herein, we explored the mechanisms of enhanced saline-alkali 
tolerance of autotetraploid rice 93-11T relative to diploid rice 93-11D, based 
on physiological, hormonal and transcriptomic profilings. Physiologically, the 
enhanced saline-alkali tolerance in 93-11T was manifested in higher soluble 
sugar accumulation and stronger superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) 
activities in leaves during 24 h after saline-alkali shock. Furthermore, various 
hormone levels in leaves of 93-11T altered greatly, such as the negative 
correlation between salicylic acid (SA) and the other four hormones changed to 
positive correlation due to polyploidy. Global transcriptome profiling revealed 
that the upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in leaves and roots 
of 93-11T were more abundant than that in 93-11D, and there were more DEGs in 
roots than in leaves under saline-alkali stress. Genes related to phytohormone 
signal transduction of auxin (AUX) and SA in roots, lignin biosynthesis in 
leaves or roots, and wax biosynthesis in leaves were obviously upregulated in 
93-11T compared with 93-11D under saline-alkali condition. Collectively, 93-11T 
subjected to saline-alkali stress possibly possesses higher osmotic regulation 
ability due to cuticular wax synthesis, stronger negative regulation of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) production by increasing the SA levels and maintaining 
relative lower levels of IAA, and higher antioxidant capacity by increasing 
activities of SOD and POD, as well as lignin biosynthesis. Our research provides 
new insights for exploring the mechanisms of saline-alkali tolerance in 
polyploid rice and discovering new gene targets for rice genetic improvement."
1272,"Ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), a key downstream effector of the mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mTOR), regulates diverse functions, such as cell 
proliferation, cell growth, and protein synthesis. Because S6K1 was previously 
known to be localized in the cytoplasm, its function has been mainly studied in 
the cytoplasm. However, the nuclear localization and function of S6K1 have 
recently been elucidated and other nuclear functions are expected to exist but 
remain elusive. Here, we show a novel nuclear role of S6K1 in regulating the 
expression of the Wnt target genes. Upon activation of the Wnt signaling, S6K1 
translocated from the cytosol into the nucleus and subsequently bound to 
β-catenin and the cofactors of the Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional complex, 
leading to the upregulation of the Wnt target genes. The depletion or repression 
of S6K1 downregulated the Wnt target gene expression by inhibiting the formation 
of the Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional complex. The S6K1-depleted colon cancer 
cell lines showed lower transcription levels of the Wnt/β-catenin target genes 
and a decrease in the cell proliferation and invasion compared to the control 
cell lines. Taken together, these results indicate that nuclear S6K1 positively 
regulates the expression of the Wnt target genes by inducing the reciprocal 
interaction of the subunits of the transcriptional complex."

that regulates multiple processes, including gene transcription, protein 
synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, autophagy, cell metabolism, and cell growth

1274,"Heat stress seriously affects the quality of cut lily flowers. The ethylene 
response factors (ERFs) participate in heat stress response in many plants. In 
this study, heat treatment increased the production of ethylene in lily leaves, 
and exogenous ethylene treatment enhanced the heat resistance of lilies. 
LlERF110, an important transcription factor in the ethylene signaling pathway, 
was found in the high-temperature transcriptome. The coding region of LlERF110 
(969 bp) encodes 322 amino acids and LlERF110 contains an AP2/ERF typical domain 
belonging to the ERF subfamily group X. LlERF110 was induced by ethylene and was 
expressed constitutively in all tissues. LlERF110 is localized in the nucleus 
and has transactivation activity. Virus-induced gene silencing of LlERF110 in 
lilies reduced the basal thermotolerance phenotypes and significantly decreased 
the expression of genes involved in the HSF-HSP pathway, such as LlHsfA2, 
LlHsfA3A, and LlHsfA5, which may activate other heat stress response genes; and 
LlHsp17.6 and LlHsp22, which may protect proteins under heat stress. LlERF110 
could directly bind to the promoter of LlHsfA3A and activate its expression 
according to the yeast one hybrid and dual-luciferase reporter assays. LlERF110 
interacts with LlHsfA2 in the nucleus according to BiFC and the yeast two-hybrid 
assays. In conclusion, these results indicate that LlERF110 plays an important 
role in the basal thermotolerance of lilies via regulation of the HSF-HSP 
pathway, which could be the junction of the heat stress response pathway and the 
ethylene signaling pathway."
1275,"Embryo implantation, the pivotal stage of gestation, is fundamentally dependent 
on synchronous embryonic development and uterine receptivity. In the early 
gestation period, the uterus and conceptus secrete growth factors, cytokines, 
and hormones to promote implantation. Circulating exosomal miRNAs are potential 
indicators of normal or complicated gestation. Our previous study revealed that 
pregnant sows' serum exosomes had upregulated miR-92b-3p expression compared to 
non-pregnant sows, and that the expression level progressively increased during 
early gestation. The present study's findings indicate that, compared to the 
ninth day of the estrous cycle (C9), pregnant sows had upregulated miR-92b-3p 
expression in the endometrium and embryos during the implantation stage ranging 
from day 9 to day 15 of gestation. Additionally, our results demonstrate that 
miR-92b-3p promotes the proliferation and migration of Porcine Trophoblast Cells 
(PTr2). Dual-Luciferase Reporter (DLR) gene assay, real-time fluorescent 
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and Western blotting (WB) confirmed the 
bioinformatics prediction that phosphofructokinase-M (PFKM) serves as a target 
gene of miR-92b-3p. Notably, interference of PFKM gene expression markedly 
promoted PTr2 proliferation and migration. Furthermore, mice with downregulated 
uterine miR-92b-3p expression had smaller rates of successful embryo 
implantation. In summary, miR-92b-3p putatively modulates embryo implantation by 
promoting PTr2 proliferation and migration via its target gene PFKM."
1276,"Leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor 1 (LAIR1, CD305) belongs 
to the family of immune-inhibitory receptors and is widely expressed on 
hematopoietic mature cells, particularly on immune cells. Four different types 
of ligands of LAIR1 have been described, including collagens, suggesting a 
potential immune-regulatory function on the extracellular matrix. By modulating 
cytokine secretion and cellular functions, LAIR1 displays distinct patterns of 
expression among NK cell and T/B lymphocyte subsets during their differentiation 
and cellular activation and plays a major negative immunoregulatory role. Beyond 
its implications in physiology, the activity of LAIR1 can be inappropriately 
involved in various autoimmune or inflammatory disorders and has been implicated 
in cancer physiopathology, including hematological neoplasms. Its action as an 
inhibitory receptor can result in the dysregulation of immune cellular responses 
and in immune escape within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, when 
expressed by tumor cells, LAIR1 can modulate their proliferation or invasion 
properties, with contradictory pro- or anti-tumoral effects depending on tumor 
type. In this review, we will focus on its role in normal physiological 
conditions, as well as during pathological situations, including hematological 
malignancies. We will also discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting 
LAIR1 for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases and cancer settings."
1277,"PHF21A (PHD finger protein 21A) gene, located in the short arm of chromosome 11, 
encodes for BHC80, a component of the Lysine Specific Demethylase 1, Corepressor 
of REST (LSD1-CoREST) complex. BHC80 is mainly expressed in the human fetal 
brain and skeletal muscle and acts as a modulator of several neuronal genes 
during embryogenesis. Data from literature relates PHF21A variants with 
Potocki-Shaffer Syndrome (PSS), a contiguous gene deletion disorder caused by 
the haploinsufficiency of PHF21A, ALX4, and EXT2 genes. Clinical cardinal 
features of PSS syndrome are multiple exostoses (due to the EXT2 involvement), 
biparietal foramina (due to the ALX4 involvement), intellectual disability, and 
craniofacial anomalies (due to the PHF21A involvement). To date, to the best of 
our knowledge, a detailed description of PHF21A-related disorder clinical 
phenotype is not described in the literature; in fact, only 14 subjects with 
microdeletion frameshift or nonsense variants concerning only PHF21A gene have 
been reported. All reported cases did not present ALX4 or EXT2 variants, and 
their clinical features did not fit with PSS diagnosis. Herein, by using Exome 
sequencing, and Sanger sequencing of the region of interest, we describe a case 
of a child with a paternally inherited (mosaicism of 5%) truncating variant of 
the PHF21A gene (c.649_650del; p.Gln217ValfsTer6), and discuss the new evidence. 
In conclusion, these patients showed varied clinical expressions, mainly 
including the presence of intellectual disability, epilepsy, hypotonia, and 
dysmorphic features. Our study contributes to describing the genotype-phenotype 
spectrum of patients with PHF21A-related disorder; however, the limited data in 
the literature have been unable to provide a precise diagnostic protocol for 
patients with PHF21A-related disorder."
1278,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a pandemic in which conventional risk 
factors are inadequate to detect who is at risk early in the asymptomatic stage. 
Although gene variants in genes related to cholesterol, which may increase the 
risk of AMI, have been identified, no studies have systematically screened the 
genes involved in this pathway. In this study, we included 105 patients 
diagnosed with AMI with an elevation of the ST segment (STEMI) and treated with 
primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Using next-generation 
sequencing, we examined the presence of rare variants in 40 genes proposed to be 
involved in lipid metabolism and we found that 60% of AMI patients had a rare 
variant in the genes involved in the cholesterol pathway. Our data show the 
importance of considering the wide scope of the cholesterol pathway in order to 
assess the genetic risk related to AMI."
1279,"The study of insect adaptation to the defensive metabolites of host plants and 
various kinds of insecticides in order to acquire resistance is a hot topic in 
the pest-control field, but the mechanism is still unclear. In our study, we 
found that a general signal pathway exists in H. armigera which can regulate 
multiple P450s, GSTs and UGTs genes to help insects decrease their 
susceptibility to xenobiotics. Knockdown of HaNrf2 and HaAhR expression could 
significantly increase the toxicity of xenobiotics to H. armigera, and 
simultaneously decrease the gene expression of P450s, GSTs and UGTs which are 
related to the xenobiotic metabolism and synthesis of insect hormone pathways. 
Then, we used EMSA and dual luciferase assay to verify that a crosstalk exists 
between AhR and Nrf2 to regulate multiple P450s, GSTs and UGTs genes to mediate 
H. armigera susceptibility to plant allelochemicals and insecticides. The 
detoxification genes' expression network which can be regulated by Nrf2 and AhR 
is still unknown, and there were also no reports about the crosstalk between AhR 
and Nrf2 that exist in insects and can regulate multiple detoxification genes' 
expression. Our results provide a new general signaling pathway to reveal the 
adaptive mechanism of insects to xenobiotics and provides further insight into 
designing effective pest-management strategies to avoid the overuse of 
insecticides."
1280,"Anthocyanins are a class of antioxidants that scavenge free radicals in cells 
and play an important role in promoting human health and preventing many 
diseases. Here, we characterized a maize Bronze gene (BZ1) from the purple 
colored W22 introgression line, which encodes an anthocyanin 
3-O-glucosyltransferase, a key enzyme in the anthocyanin synthesis pathway. 
Mutation of ZmBZ1 showed bronze-colored seeds and reduced anthocyanins in seeds 
aleurone layer, seedlings coleoptile, and stem of mature plants by comparison 
with purple colored W22 (WT). Furthermore, we proved that maize BZ1 is an 
aleurone layer-specific expressed protein and sub-located in cell nucleus. 
Real-time tracing of the anthocyanins in developing seeds demonstrated that the 
pigment was visible from 16 DAP (day after pollination) in field condition, and 
first deposited in the crown part then spread all over the seed. Additionally, 
it was transferred along with the embryo cell activity during seed germination, 
from aleurone layer to cotyledon and coleoptile, as confirmed by microscopy and 
real-time qRT-PCR. Finally, we demonstrated that the ZmBZ1 contributes to stress 
tolerance, especially salinity. Further study proved that ZmBZ1 participates in 
reactive oxygen scavenging (ROS) by accumulating anthocyanins, thereby enhancing 
the tolerance to abiotic stress."
1281,"Camptothecin (CPT) and its derivatives from Camptotheca acuminata have antitumor 
effects as a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. Previous studies have shown that 
application of exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) significantly promoted the 
accumulation level of CPT and induced the expression of CPT biosynthetic genes, 
which revealed that ABA signaling is effectively involved in regulating CPT 
biosynthesis in C. acuminata. In this study, an ABA transporter, CaABAT, which 
encodes a plasma membrane protein belonging to the ABCG subfamily, was 
identified in C. acuminata, and its ABA import activity was confirmed by 
transport assay in yeast cells. Real-time PCR analysis showed that CaABAT was 
predominately expressed in C. acuminata leaves and its expression could be 
significantly upregulated by exogenous ABA treatment. Silencing of CaABAT 
down-regulated the expression of ABA response genes, which indicated that 
translocation of ABA by CaABAT should initiate changes in plant physiological 
status in response to ABA signaling, thus leading to decreased expression of CPT 
biosynthesis pathway genes and low accumulation levels of CPT in C. acuminata."
1282,"Some of the hormone crosstalk and transcription factors (TFs) involved in 
wound-induced organ regeneration have been extensively studied in the model 
plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In previous work, we established Solanum 
lycopersicum ""Micro-Tom"" explants without the addition of exogenous hormones as 
a model to investigate wound-induced de novo organ formation. The current 
working model indicates that cell reprogramming and founder cell activation 
requires spatial and temporal regulation of auxin-to-cytokinin (CK) gradients in 
the apical and basal regions of the hypocotyl combined with extensive metabolic 
reprogramming of some cells in the apical region. In this work, we extended our 
transcriptomic analysis to identify some of the gene regulatory networks 
involved in wound-induced organ regeneration in tomato. Our results highlight a 
functional conservation of key TF modules whose function is conserved during de 
novo organ formation in plants, which will serve as a valuable resource for 
future studies."
1283,"Active surveillance (AS) is the best strategy for small renal masses (SRMs) 
management; however, reliable methods for early detection and disease 
aggressiveness prediction are urgently needed. The aim of the present study was 
to validate DNA methylation biomarkers for non-invasive SRM detection and 
prognosis. The levels of methylated genes TFAP2B, TAC1, PCDH8, ZNF677, FLRT2, 
and FBN2 were evaluated in 165 serial urine samples prospectively collected from 
39 patients diagnosed with SRM, specifically renal cell carcinoma (RCC), before 
and during the AS via quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain 
reaction. Voided urine samples from 92 asymptomatic volunteers were used as the 
control. Significantly higher methylated TFAP2B, TAC1, PCDH8, ZNF677, and FLRT2 
levels and/or frequencies were detected in SRM patients' urine samples as 
compared to the control. The highest diagnostic power (AUC = 0.74) was observed 
for the four biomarkers panel with 92% sensitivity and 52% specificity. 
Methylated PCDH8 level positively correlated with SRM size at diagnosis, while 
TFAP2B had the opposite effect and was related to SRM progression. To sum up, 
SRMs contribute significantly to the amount of methylated DNA detectable in 
urine, which might be used for very early RCC detection. Moreover, PCDH8 and 
TFAP2B methylation have the potential to be prognostic biomarkers for SRMs."
1284,"Xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) genes play an important role in 
plant resistance to abiotic stress. However, systematic studies of the response 
of Boehmeria nivea (ramie) XTH genes (BnXTHs) to cadmium (Cd) stress are 
lacking. We sought to identify the BnXTH-family genes in ramie through 
bioinformatics analyses and to investigate their responses to Cd stress. We 
identified 19 members of the BnXTH gene family from the ramie genome, referred 
to as BnXTH1-19, among which BnXTH18 and BnXTH19 were located on no chromosomes 
and the remaining genes were unevenly distributed across 11 chromosomes. The 19 
members were divided into four groups, Groups I/II/IIIA/IIIB, according to their 
phylogenetic relationships, and these groups were supported by analyses of 
intron-exon structure and conserved motif composition. A highly conserved 
catalytic site (HDEIDFEFLG) was observed in all BnXTH proteins. Additionally, 
three gene pairs (BnXTH6-BnXTH16, BnXTH8-BnXTH9, and BnXTH17-BnXTH18) were 
obtained with a fragment and tandem-repeat event analysis of the ramie genome. 
An analysis of cisregulatory elements revealed that BnXTH expression might be 
regulated by multiple hormones and abiotic and biotic stress responses. In 
particular, 17 cisregulatory elements related to abiotic and biotic stress 
responses and 11 cisregulatory elements related to hormone responses were 
identified. We also found that most BnXTH genes responded to Cd stress, and 
BnXTH1, BnXTH3, BnXTH6, and BnXTH15 were most likely to contribute to the Cd 
tolerance of ramie, as evidenced by the substantial increases in expression 
under Cd treatment. Heterologous expression of BnXTH1, BnXTH6, and BnXTH15 
significantly enhanced the Cd tolerance of transgenic yeast cells. These results 
suggest that the BnXTH gene family is involved in Cd stress responses, laying a 
theoretical foundation for functional studies of BnXTH genes and the innovative 
breeding of Cd-tolerant ramie."
1285,"The synthesis of silver nanoparticles using biogenic methods, particularly 
plants, has led to the discovery of several effective nanoparticles. In many 
instances, plant-derived silver nanoparticles have been shown to have more 
activity than the plant extract which was used to synthesize the nanoparticles. 
Silver nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized using the medicinal 
plant, Cotyledon orbiculata. This is a shrub found in the Western Cape province 
of South Africa. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine in the 
treatment of wounds and skin infections. The C. orbiculata synthesized silver 
nanoparticles (Cotyledon-AgNPs) were reported to have good antimicrobial and 
anti-inflammatory activities; however, their wound-healing properties have not 
been determined. This study aimed to determine the wound healing activity of 
Cotyledon-AgNPs using the scratch assay. Gene expression studies were also done 
to determine the nanoparticles' mechanism of action. The Cotyledon-AgNPs showed 
good antioxidant, growth-promoting and cell migration properties. Gene 
expression studies showed that the C. orbiculata water extract and 
Cotyledon-AgNPs promoted wound healing by upregulating genes involved in cell 
proliferation, migration and growth while downregulating pro-inflammatory genes. 
This confirms, for the first time that a water extract of C. orbiculata and 
silver nanoparticles synthesized from this extract are good wound-healing 
agents."
1286,"Mitochondrial ATP production plays an important role in most cellular 
activities, including growth and differentiation. Previously we reported that 
Adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) is the main ADP supplier in the mitochondrial 
intermembrane space in hematopoietic cells, especially in the bone marrow. AK2 
is crucial for the production of neutrophils and T cells, and its deficiency 
causes reticular dysgenesis. However, the relationship between ADP supply by AK2 
and neutrophil differentiation remains unclear. In this study, we used 
CRISPR/Cas9 technology to establish two heterozygous AK2 knock-out HL-60 clones 
as models for reticular dysgenesis. Their AK2 activities were about half that in 
the wild-type (WT). Furthermore, neutrophil differentiation was impaired in one 
of the clones. In silico analysis predicted that the obtained mutations might 
cause a structural change in AK2. Time course microarray analysis of the WT and 
mutants revealed that similar gene clusters responded to all-trans retinoic acid 
treatment, but their expression was lower in the mutants than in WT. Application 
of fructose partially restored neutrophil differentiation in the heterozygous 
knock-out HL-60 clone after all-trans retinoic acid treatment. Collectively, our 
study suggests that the mutation of N-terminal region in AK2 might play a role 
in AK2-dependent neutrophil differentiation and fructose could be used to treat 
AK2 deficiency."
1287,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important molecular processes that 
regulate organismal responses to different stresses. Ubiquitination modification 
is not only involved in human health but also plays crucial roles in plant 
growth, development, and responses to environmental stresses. In this study, we 
investigated the ubiquitination proteome changes in the salt-tolerant sugar beet 
monomeric additional line M14 under salt stress treatments. Based on the 
expression of the key genes of the ubiquitination system and the 
ubiquitination-modified proteins before and after salt stress, 30 min of 200 mM 
NaCl treatment and 6 h of 400 mM NaCl treatment were selected as time points. 
Through label-free proteomics, 4711 and 3607 proteins were identified in plants 
treated with 200 mM NaCl and 400 mM NaCl, respectively. Among them, 611 and 380 
proteins were ubiquitinated, with 1085 and 625 ubiquitination sites, in the two 
salt stress conditions, respectively. A quantitative analysis revealed that 70 
ubiquitinated proteins increased and 47 ubiquitinated proteins decreased. At the 
total protein level, 42 were induced and 20 were repressed with 200 mM NaCl, 
while 28 were induced and 27 were repressed with 400 mM NaCl. Gene ontology, 
KEGG pathway, protein interaction, and PTM crosstalk analyses were performed 
using the differentially ubiquitinated proteins. The differentially 
ubiquitinated proteins were mainly involved in cellular transcription and 
translation processes, signal transduction, metabolic pathways, and the 
ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway. The uncovered ubiquitinated proteins 
constitute an important resource of the plant stress ubiquitinome, and they 
provide a theoretical basis for the marker-based molecular breeding of crops for 
enhanced stress tolerance."
1288,"The generation of human macrophages from induced pluripotent stem cells (iMacs) 
is a rapidly developing approach used to create disease models, screen drugs, 
study macrophage-pathogen interactions and develop macrophage-based cell 
therapy. To generate iMacs, different types of protocols have been suggested, 
all thought to result in the generation of similar iMac populations. However, 
direct comparison of iMacs generated using different protocols has not been 
performed. We have compared the productivity, the differentiation trajectories 
and the characteristics of iMacs generated using two widely used protocols: one 
based on the formation of embryoid bodies and the induction of myeloid 
differentiation by only two cytokines, interleukin-3 and macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor, and the other utilizing multiple exogenous factors 
for iMac generation. We report inter-protocol differences in the following: (i) 
protocol productivity; (ii) dynamic changes in the expression of genes related 
to inflammation and lipid homeostasis following iMac differentiation and (iii) 
the transcriptomic profiles of terminally differentiated iMacs, including the 
expression of genes involved in inflammatory response, antigen presentation and 
lipid homeostasis. The results document the dependence of fine iMac 
characteristics on the type of differentiation protocol, which is important for 
further development of the field, including the development of iMac-based cell 
therapy."
1289,"Pectin is one of the constituents of the cell wall, distributed in the primary 
cell wall and middle lamella, affecting the rheological properties and the cell 
wall stickiness. Pectin methylesterase (PME) and pectin methylesterase inhibitor 
(PMEI) are the most important factors for modifying methyl esterification. In 
this study, 45 PMEI genes from rice (Oryza sativa L.) were screened by 
bioinformatics tools, and their structure, motifs, cis-acting elements in the 
promoter region, chromosomal distribution, gene duplication, and phylogenetic 
relationship were analyzed. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to edit the 
OsPMEI12 (LOC_Os03G01020) and two mutant pmei12 lines were obtained to explore 
the functions of OsPMEI in plant growth and development, and under cadmium (Cd) 
stress. Compared to wild type (WT) Nipponbare, the second inverted internodes of 
the mutant plants shortened significantly, resulting in the reduction in plant 
height at mature stage. The seed setting rate, and fresh and dry weights of the 
mutants were also decreased in mutant plants. In addition, the pectin 
methylation of pmei12 lines is decreased as expected, and the pectin content of 
the cell wall increased at both seedling and maturity stages; however, the 
cellulose and hemicellulose increased only at seedling stage. Interestingly, the 
growth of the pmei12 lines was better than the WT in both normal conditions and 
under two phytohormone (GA3 and NAA) treatments at seedling stage. Under Cd 
stress, the fresh and dry weights were increased in pmei12 lines. These results 
indicated that OsPMEI12 was involved in the regulation of methyl esterification 
during growth, affected cell wall composition and agronomic traits, and might 
play an important role in responses to phytohormones and stress."
1290,"The application of in vivo bioluminescent imaging in infectious disease research 
has significantly increased over the past years. The detection of transgenic 
parasites expressing wildtype firefly luciferase is however hampered by a 
relatively low and heterogeneous tissue penetrating capacity of emitted light. 
Solutions are sought by using codon-optimized red-shifted luciferases that yield 
higher expression levels and produce relatively more red or near-infrared light, 
or by using modified bioluminescent substrates with enhanced cell permeability 
and improved luminogenic or pharmacokinetic properties. In this study, the in 
vitro and in vivo efficacy of two modified bioluminescent substrates, CycLuc1 
and AkaLumine-HCl, were compared with that of D-luciferin as a gold standard. 
Comparisons were made in experimental and insect-transmitted animal models of 
leishmaniasis (caused by intracellular Leishmania species) and African 
trypanosomiasis (caused by extracellular Trypanosoma species), using parasite 
strains expressing the red-shifted firefly luciferase PpyRE9. Although the 
luminogenic properties of AkaLumine-HCl and D-luciferin for in vitro parasite 
detection were comparable at equal substrate concentrations, AkaLumine-HCl 
proved to be unsuitable for in vivo infection follow-up due to high background 
signals in the liver. CycLuc1 presented a higher in vitro luminescence compared 
to the other substrates and proved to be highly efficacious in vivo, even at a 
20-fold lower dose than D-luciferin. This efficacy was consistent across 
infections with the herein included intracellular and extracellular parasitic 
organisms. It can be concluded that CycLuc1 is an excellent and broadly 
applicable alternative for D-luciferin, requiring significantly lower doses for 
in vivo bioluminescent imaging in rodent models of leishmaniasis and African 
trypanosomiasis."
1291,"The rumen is an important hallmark organ of ruminants and plays an important 
role in the metabolism and immune barrier of Tibetan sheep on the Plateau. 
However, there are few studies on rumen development and metabolism regulation in 
Tibetan sheep at different ages. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the immune 
function, fermentation function, rumen epithelial micromorphology and 
transcriptome profile of Tibetan sheep at different ages. The results showed 
that the concentration of IgG decreased and the concentration of IgM increased 
with age (p &lt; 0.05), and the highest concentration of IgA was observed at 1.5 
and 3.5 years of age. In terms of rumen fermentation characteristics, VFAs of 
4-month-old lambs were the highest, followed by VFAs and NH3-N of Tibetan sheep 
at 3.5 years of age. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron 
microscopy section examination of rumen epithelial tissue showed that the rumen 
papilla width increased with age (p &lt; 0.001), the thickness of the stratum 
corneum decreased, the cells in the stratum corneum showed accelerated migration 
and the thickness of the rumen muscle layer increased (p &lt; 0.001). Desmosomal 
junctions between the layers of rumen epithelium increased at 1.5 and 3.5 years 
old, forming a compact barrier structure, and the basal layer had more 
mitochondria involved in the regulation of energy metabolism. RNA-seq analysis 
revealed that a total of 1006 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
identified at four ages. The DEGs of Tibetan sheep aged 4 months and 6 years 
were mainly enriched in the oxidation-reduction process and ISG15-protein 
conjugation pathway. The 1.5 and 3.5-year-olds were mainly enriched in skeletal 
muscle thin filament assembly, mesenchyme migration and the tight junction 
pathway. WGCNA showed that DEGs related to rumen microbiota metabolite VFAs and 
epithelial morphology were enriched in ""Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome 
P450, PPAR signaling pathway, Butanoate metabolism pathways"" and participated in 
the regulation of rumen epithelial immune and fermentation metabolism functions 
of Tibetan sheep at different ages. This study systematically revealed the 
regulatory mechanism of rumen epithelial development and metabolism in the 
plateau adaptation of Tibetan sheep, providing a new approach for the study of 
plateau adaptation."
1292,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal 
hematopoietic stem cell disorders with maturation and differentiation defects 
exhibiting morphological dysplasia in one or more hematopoietic cell lineages. 
They are associated with peripheral blood cytopenias and by increased risk for 
progression into acute myelogenous leukemia. Among their multifactorial 
pathogenesis, age-related epigenetic instability and the error-rate DNA 
methylation maintenance have been recognized as critical factors for both the 
initial steps of their pathogenesis and for disease progression. Although 
lower-risk MDS is associated with an inflammatory bone marrow microenvironment, 
higher-risk disease is delineated by immunosuppression and clonal expansion. 
""Epigenetics"" is a multidimensional level of gene regulation that determines the 
specific gene networks expressed in tissues under physiological conditions and 
guides appropriate chromatin rearrangements upon influence of environmental 
stimulation. Regulation of this level consists of biochemical modifications in 
amino acid residues of the histone proteins' N-terminal tails and their 
concomitant effects on chromatin structure, DNA methylation patterns in CpG 
dinucleotides and the tissue-specific non-coding RNAs repertoire, which are 
directed against various gene targets. The role of epigenetic modifications is 
widely recognized as pivotal both in gene expression control and differential 
molecular response to drug therapies in humans. Insights to the potential of 
synergistic cooperations of epigenetic mechanisms provide new avenues for 
treatment development to comfort human diseases with a known epigenetic shift, 
such as MDS. Hypomethylating agents (HMAs), such as epigenetic modulating drugs, 
have been widely used in the past years as first line treatment for elderly 
higher-risk MDS patients; however, just half of them respond to therapy and are 
benefited. Rational outcome predictors following epigenetic therapy in MDS and 
biomarkers associated with disease relapse are of high importance to improve our 
efforts in developing patient-tailored clinical approaches."
1293,"Nitrogen nutrition participates in many physiological processes and 
understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms of apple responses to 
nitrogen is very significant for improving apple quality. This study excavated 
crucial genes that regulates sugar metabolism in response to nitrogen in apples 
through physiology and transcriptome analysis, so as to lay a theoretical 
foundation for improving fruit quality. In this paper, the content of sugar and 
organic acid in apple fruit at different developmental periods under different 
nitrogen levels (0, 150, 300, and 600 kg·hm-2) were determined. Then, the 
transcriptomic analysis was performed in 120 days after bloom (DAB) and 150 DAB. 
The results showed that the fructose and glucose content were the highest at 120 
DAB under 600 kg·hm-2 nitrogen level. Meanwhile, different nitrogen treatments 
decreased malate content in 30 and 60 DAB. RNA-seq analysis revealed a total of 
4537 UniGenes were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under 
nitrogen treatments. Among these DEGs, 2362 (52.06%) were up-regulated and 2175 
(47.94%) were down-regulated. The gene co-expression clusters revealed that most 
DEGs were significantly annotated in the photosynthesis, 
glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, carbon metabolism, carbon 
fixation in photosynthetic organisms and plant hormone signal transduction 
pathways. The key transcription factor genes (ERF, NAC, WRKY, and C2H2 genes) 
were differentially expressed in apple fruit. Sugar and acid metabolism-related 
genes (e.g., HXK1, SPS4, SS2, PPC16-2, and MDH2 genes) exhibited significantly 
up-regulated expression at 120 DAB, whereas they were down-regulated at 150 DAB. 
Furthermore, the MdSPS4 gene overexpression positively promoted sucrose 
accumulation in apple callus and fruit. In conclusion, the combinational 
analysis of transcriptome and the functional validation of the MdSPS4 gene 
provides new insights into apple responses to different nitrogen levels."
1294,"Malus baccata (L.) Borkh is an apple rootstock with good drought and cold 
resistance. The ICE gene is a key factor in the molecular mechanisms of plant 
drought and cold resistance. In the present research, the function of drought- 
and cold-induced MbICE1 of Malus baccata was investigated in Arabidopsis. 
According to GFP fluorescence images, MbICE1 was determined to be a nuclear 
protein. The MbICE1 was transferred to Arabidopsis, showing enhanced tolerance 
to drought and cold stresses. Under drought and cold treatments, the transgenic 
Arabidopsis had higher chlorophyll content and free proline content than WT 
plants, but the Malondialdehyde (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage (EL) were 
lower than those of WT plants. In addition, drought and cold led to a large 
accumulation of ROS (H2O2 and O2-) content in Arabidopsis, while overexpression 
of MbICE1 enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activity in Arabidopsis and improved 
the plant's resistance to stresses. Moreover, the accumulation of MbICE1 
promoted the expression of AtCBF1, AtCBF2, AtCBF3, AtCOR15a, AtCOR47 and AtKIN1 
genes in Arabidopsis. These data indicate that MbICE1 is a key regulator of 
drought and cold and can be used as a backup gene for breeding Malus rootstocks."
1295,"Notch3 plays an important role in the differentiation and development of 
vascular smooth muscle cells. Mice lacking Notch3 show deficient renal 
autoregulation. The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanisms involved 
in the Notch3-mediated control of renal vascular response. To this end, renal 
resistance vessels (afferent arterioles) were isolated from Notch3-/- and 
wild-type littermates (WT) and stimulated with angiotensin II (ANG II). 
Contractions and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were blunted in Notch3-/- 
vessels. ANG II responses in precapillary muscle arterioles were similar between 
the WT and Notch3-/- mice, suggesting a focal action of Notch3 in renal 
vasculature. Abolishing stored Ca2+ with thapsigargin reduced Ca2+ responses in 
the renal vessels of the two strains, signifying intact intracellular Ca2+ 
mobilization in Notch3-/-. EGTA (Ca2+ chelating agent), nifedipine (L-type 
channel-blocker), or mibefradil (T-type channel-blocker) strongly reduced 
contraction and Ca2+ responses in WT mice but had no effect in Notch3-/- mice, 
indicating defective Ca2+ entry. Notch3-/- vessels responded normally to 
KCl-induced depolarization, which activates L-type channels directly. 
Differential transcriptomic analysis showed a major down-regulation of Cacna1h 
gene expression, coding for the α1H subunit of the T-type Ca2+ channel, in 
Notch3-/- vessels. In conclusion, renal resistance vessels from Notch3-/- mice 
display altered vascular reactivity to ANG II due to deficient Ca2+-entry. 
Consequently, Notch3 is essential for proper excitation-contraction coupling and 
vascular-tone regulation in the kidney."
1296,"Seawater pH and carbonate saturation are predicted to decrease dramatically by 
the end of the century. This process, designated ocean acidification (OA), 
threatens economically and ecologically important marine calcifiers, including 
the northern quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria). While many studies have 
demonstrated the adverse impacts of OA on bivalves, much less is known about 
mechanisms of resilience and adaptive strategies. Here, we examined clam 
responses to OA by evaluating cellular (hemocyte activities) and molecular 
(high-throughput proteomics, RNASeq) changes in hemolymph and extrapallial fluid 
(EPF-the site of biomineralization located between the mantle and the shell) in 
M. mercenaria continuously exposed to acidified (pH ~7.3; pCO2 ~2700 ppm) and 
normal conditions (pH ~8.1; pCO2 ~600 ppm) for one year. The extracellular pH of 
EPF and hemolymph (~7.5) was significantly higher than that of the external 
acidified seawater (~7.3). Under OA conditions, granulocytes (a sub-population 
of hemocytes important for biomineralization) were able to increase 
intracellular pH (by 54% in EPF and 79% in hemolymph) and calcium content (by 
56% in hemolymph). The increased pH of EPF and hemolymph from clams exposed to 
high pCO2 was associated with the overexpression of genes (at both the mRNA and 
protein levels) related to biomineralization, acid-base balance, and calcium 
homeostasis, suggesting that clams can use corrective mechanisms to mitigate the 
negative impact of OA."
1297,"Cell migration is an essential part of the complex and multistep process that is 
the development of cancer, a disease that is the second most common cause of 
death in humans. An important factor promoting the migration of cancer cells is 
TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that, among its many biological functions, 
also plays a major role in mediating the expression of MMP9, one of the key 
regulators of cancer cell migration. It is also known that TNF-α is able to 
induce the Warburg effect in some cells by increasing glucose uptake and 
enhancing the expression and activity of lactate dehydrogenase subunit A (LDHA). 
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the interrelationship 
between the TNF-α-induced promigratory activity of cancer cells and their 
glucose metabolism status, using esophageal cancer cells as an example. By 
inhibiting LDHA activity with sodium oxamate (SO, also known as aminooxoacetic 
acid sodium salt or oxamic acid sodium salt) or siRNA-mediated gene silencing, 
we found using wound healing assay and gelatin zymography that LDHA 
downregulation impairs TNF-α-dependent tumor cell migration and significantly 
reduces TNF-α-induced MMP9 expression. These effects were associated with 
disturbances in the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, as we observed 
by Western blotting. We also reveal that in esophageal cancer cells, SO 
effectively reduces the production of lactic acid, which, as we have shown, 
synergizes the stimulating effect of TNF-α on MMP9 expression. In conclusion, 
our findings identified LDHA as a regulator of TNF-α-induced cell migration in 
esophageal cancer cells by the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, suggesting that LDHA 
inhibitors that limit the migration of cancer cells caused by the inflammatory 
process may be considered as an adjunct to standard therapy in esophageal cancer 
patients."
1298,"Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) is a rare autosomal recessive developmental 
and epileptic encephalopathy caused by pathogenic variants in the ALDH7A1 gene 
(PDE-ALDH7A1), which mainly has its onset in neonates and infants. Early 
diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent severe neurological sequelae or 
death. Sensitive, specific, and stable biomarkers for diagnostic evaluations and 
follow-up examinations are essential to optimize outcomes. However, most of the 
known biomarkers for PDE lack these criteria. Additionally, there is little 
discussion regarding the interdependence of biomarkers in the PDE-ALDH7A1 
metabolite profile. Therefore, the aim of this study was to understand the 
underlying mechanisms in PDE-ALDH7A1 and to discover new biomarkers in the 
plasma of patients using global metabolomics. Plasma samples from 9 patients 
with genetically confirmed PDE-ALDH7A1 and 22 carefully selected control 
individuals were analyzed by ultra high performance liquid 
chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). Two novel and 
reliable pyridoxine-independent diagnostic markers, 6-hydroxy-2-aminocaproic 
acid (HACA) and an isomer of C9H11NO4, were identified. Furthermore, a possible 
reaction mechanism is proposed for HACA. This study demonstrates the capability 
of global metabolomics in disease screening to detect established and novel 
biomarkers."
1299,"Endothelial cells are a critical target of the soluble Fms-like tyrosine 
kinase-1 (sFlt-1), a soluble factor increased in different diseases with varying 
degrees of renal impairment and endothelial dysfunction, including chronic 
kidney disease (CKD). Although the mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction 
are multifactorial and complex, herein, we investigated the damaging effects of 
sFlt-1 on structural and functional changes in endothelial cells. Our results 
evidenced that sera from patients with CKD stiffen the endothelial cell cortex 
in vitro, an effect correlated with sFlt-1 levels and prevented by sFlt-1 
neutralization. Besides, we could show that recombinant sFlt-1 leads to 
endothelial stiffening in vitro and in vivo. This was accompanied by 
cytoskeleton reorganization and changes in the endothelial barrier function, as 
observed by increased actin polymerization and endothelial cell permeability, 
respectively. These results depended on the activation of the p38 MAPK and were 
blocked by the specific inhibitor SB203580. However, sFlt-1 only minimally 
affected the expression of stiffness-sensitive genes. These findings bring new 
insight into the mechanism of action of sFlt-1 and its biological effects that 
cannot be exclusively ascribed to the regulation of angiogenesis."
1300,"Prenylated flavonol glycosides in Epimedium plants, as key medicinal components, 
are known to have great pharmaceutical activities for human health. Among the 
main prenylated flavonol glycosides, the modification mechanism of different 
sugar moieties is still not well understood. In the current study, a novel 
prenylated flavonol rhamnoside xylosyltransferase gene (EpF3R2″XylT) was cloned 
from E. pubescens, and the enzymatic activity of its decoding proteins was 
examined in vitro with different prenylated flavonol rhamnoside substrates and 
different 3-O-monosaccharide moieties. Furthermore, the functional and 
structural domains of EpF3R2″XylT were analyzed by bioinformatic approaches and 
3-D protein structure remodeling. In summary, EpF3R2″XylT was shown to cluster 
with GGT (glycosyltransferase that glycosylates sugar moieties of glycosides) 
through phylogenetic analysis. In enzymatic analysis, EpF3R2″XylT was proven to 
transfer xylose moiety from UDP-xylose to prenylated flavonol rhamnoside at the 
2″-OH position of rhamnose. The analysis of enzymatic kinetics showed that 
EpF3R2″XylT had the highest substrate affinity toward icariin with the lowest Km 
value of 75.96 ± 11.91 mM. Transient expression of EpF3R2″XylT in tobacco leaf 
showed functional production of EpF3R2″XylT proteins in planta. EpF3R2″XylT was 
preferably expressed in the leaves of E. pubescens, which is consistent with the 
accumulation levels of major prenylflavonol 3-O-triglycoside. The discovery of 
EpF3R2″XylT will provide an economical and efficient alternative way to produce 
prenylated flavonol trisaccharides through the biosynthetic approach."
1301,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived structures surrounded by a lipid 
bilayer that carry RNA and DNA as potential templates for molecular diagnostics, 
e.g., in cancer genotyping. While it has been established that DNA templates 
appear on the outside of EVs, no consensus exists on which nucleic acid species 
inside small EVs (&lt;200 nm, sEVs) are sufficiently abundant and accessible for 
developing genotyping protocols. We investigated this by extracting total 
intravesicular nucleic acid content from sEVs isolated from the conditioned cell 
medium of the human NCI-H1975 cell line containing the epidermal growth factor 
(EGFR) gene mutation T790M as a model system for non-small cell lung cancer. We 
observed that mainly short genomic DNA (&lt;35-100 bp) present in the sEVs 
served as a template. Using qEV size exclusion chromatography (SEC), 
significantly lower yield and higher purity of isolated sEV fractions were 
obtained as compared to exoEasy membrane affinity purification and 
ultracentrifugation. Nevertheless, we detected the EGFR T790M mutation in the 
sEVs' lumen with similar sensitivity using digital PCR. When applying SEC-based 
sEV separation prior to cell-free DNA extraction on spiked human plasma samples, 
we found significantly higher mutant allele frequencies as compared to standard 
cell-free DNA extraction, which in part was due to co-purification of 
circulating tumor DNA. We conclude that intravesicular genomic DNA can be 
exploited next to ctDNA to enhance EGFR T790M mutation detection sensitivity by 
adding a fast and easy-to-use sEV separation method, such as SEC, upstream of 
standard clinical cell-free DNA workflows."
1302,"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a key component of migraine 
pathophysiology, yielding effective migraine therapeutics. CGRP receptors 
contain a core accessory protein subunit: receptor activity-modifying protein 1 
(RAMP1). Understanding of RAMP1 expression is incomplete, partly due to the 
challenges in identifying specific and validated antibody tools. We profiled 
antibodies for immunodetection of RAMP1 using Western blotting, 
immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry, including using RAMP1 knockout 
mouse tissue. Most antibodies could detect RAMP1 in Western blotting and 
immunocytochemistry using transfected cells. Two antibodies (844, ab256575) 
could detect a RAMP1-like band in Western blots of rodent brain but not RAMP1 
knockout mice. However, cross-reactivity with other proteins was evident for all 
antibodies. This cross-reactivity prevented clear conclusions about RAMP1 
anatomical localization, as each antibody detected a distinct pattern of 
immunoreactivity in rodent brain. We cannot confidently attribute 
immunoreactivity produced by RAMP1 antibodies (including 844) to the presence of 
RAMP1 protein in immunohistochemical applications in brain tissue. RAMP1 
expression in brain and other tissues therefore needs to be revisited using 
RAMP1 antibodies that have been comprehensively validated using multiple 
strategies to establish multiple lines of convincing evidence. As RAMP1 is 
important for other GPCR/ligand pairings, our results have broader significance 
beyond the CGRP field."
1303,"Melon (Cucumis melo) is an important economic crop cultivated worldwide. A 
unique SUN gene family plays a crucial role in regulating plant growth and fruit 
development, but many SUN family genes and their function have not been 
well-characterized in melon. In the present study, we performed genome-wide 
identification and bioinformatics analysis and identified 24 CmSUN family genes 
that contain integrated and conserved IQ67 domain in the melon genome. 
Transcriptome data analysis and qRT-PCR results showed that most CmSUNs are 
specifically enriched in melon reproductive organs, such as young flowers and 
ovaries. Through genetic transformation in melons, we found that overexpression 
of CmSUN23-24 and CmSUN25-26-27c led to an increased fruit shape index, 
suggesting that they act as essential regulators in melon fruit shape variation. 
Subcellular localization revealed that the CmSUN23-24 protein is located in the 
cytoplasmic membrane. A direct interaction between CmSUN23-24 and a Calmodulin 
protein CmCaM5 was found by yeast two-hybrid assay, which indicated their 
participation in the calcium signal transduction pathway in regulating plant 
growth. These findings revealed the molecular characteristics, expression 
profile, and functional pattern of the CmSUN genes, and may provide the 
theoretical basis for the genetic improvement of melon fruit breeding."
1304,"F-box genes play an important role in plant growth and resistance to abiotic and 
biotic stresses. To date, systematic analysis of F-box genes and functional 
annotation in eggplant (Solanum melongena) is still limited. Here, we identified 
389 F-box candidate genes in eggplant. The domain study of F-box candidate genes 
showed that the F-box domain is conserved, whereas the C-terminal domain is 
diverse. There are 376 SmFBX candidate genes distributed on 12 chromosomes. A 
collinearity analysis within the eggplant genome suggested that tandem 
duplication is the dominant form of F-box gene replication in eggplant. The 
collinearity analysis between eggplant and the three other species (Arabidopsis 
thaliana, rice and tomato) provides insight into the evolutionary 
characteristics of F-box candidate genes. In addition, we analyzed the 
expression of SmFBX candidate genes in different tissues under high temperature 
and bacterial wilt stress. The results identified several F-box candidate genes 
that potentially participate in eggplant heat tolerance and bacterial wilt 
resistance. Moreover, the yeast two-hybrid assay showed that several 
representative F-box candidate proteins interacted with representative Skp1 
proteins. Overexpression of SmFBX131 and SmFBX230 in tobacco increased 
resistance to bacterial wilt. Overall, these results provide critical insights 
into the functional analysis of the F-box gene superfamily in eggplant and 
provide potentially valuable targets for heat and bacterial resistance."
1305,"Overlapping disease aetiologies associated with multiple altered biological 
processes have been identified that change the endometrial function leading to 
recurrent implantation failure (RIF) and recurrent early pregnancy loss (REPL). 
We aimed to provide a detailed insight into the nature of the biological 
malfunction and related pathways of differentially expressed genes in RIF and 
REPL. Endometrial biopsies were obtained from 9 women experiencing RIF, REPL and 
control groups. Affymetrix microarray analysis was performed to measure the gene 
expression level of the endometrial biopsies. Unsupervised clustering of 
endometrial samples shows scattered distribution of gene expression between the 
RIF, REPL and control groups. 2556 and 1174 genes (p value &lt; 0.05, Fold 
change &gt; 1.2) were significantly altered in the endometria of RIF and REPL 
patients' group, respectively compared to the control group. Downregulation in 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of the differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) in RIF and REPL including ribosome and oxidative 
phosphorylation pathways. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed ribosomes and 
mitochondria inner membrane as the most significantly downregulated cellular 
component (CC) affected in RIF and REPL. Determination of the dysregulated genes 
and related biological pathways in RIF and REPL will be key in understanding 
their molecular pathology and of major importance in addressing diagnosis, 
prognosis, and treatment issues."
1306,"Connexin 30 (Cx30), which forms gap junctions between astrocytes, regulates cell 
adhesion and migration, and modulates glutamate transport. Cx30 is upregulated 
on activated astroglia in central nervous system inflammatory lesions, including 
spinal cord lesions in mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) transgenic 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model mice. Here, we investigated the role 
of Cx30 in mSOD1 mice. Cx30 was highly expressed in the pre-onset stage in mSOD1 
mice. mSOD1 mice with knockout (KO) of the Cx30 gene (Cx30KO-mSOD1 mice) showed 
delayed disease onset and tended to have an extended survival period (log-rank, 
p = 0.09). At the progressive and end stages of the disease, anterior horn cells 
were significantly preserved in Cx30KO-mSOD1 mice. In lesions of these mice, 
glial fibrillary acidic protein/C3-positive inflammatory astroglia were 
decreased. Additionally, the activation of astrocytes in Cx30KO-mSOD1 mice was 
reduced compared with mSOD1 mice by gene expression microarray. Furthermore, 
expression of connexin 43 at the pre-onset stage was downregulated in 
Cx30KO-mSOD1 mice. These findings suggest that reduced expression of astroglial 
Cx30 at the early disease stage in ALS model mice protects neurons by 
attenuating astroglial inflammation."
1307,"Bone formation is critically needed in orthopedic clinical practice. We found 
that, bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) gene expression was significantly 
increased in fractured mice, which activates canonical Wnt signaling exclusively 
in osteocytes. Wnt and BMP signaling appear to exhibit synergistic or 
antagonistic effects in different kinds of cells. However, the communication 
between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and BMP signaling in osteocytes is almost 
unknown. Our study verified in vitro that BMP-7 expression was significantly 
increased when Wnt signaling was activated in osteocytes. Next, BMP-7 in 
osteocytes was overexpressed using an adenovirus, the osteogenesis of bone 
marrow stem cells (BMSCs) was enhanced, when cocultured with osteocytes. On the 
contrary, BMP-7 in osteocytes was silenced using an adenovirus, the osteogenesis 
of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) was weakened. In addition, the osteogenesis of 
BMSCs was no longer promoted by Wnt-activated osteocytes when BMP-7 was 
silenced. Therefore, the results showed that BMP-7 mediated the anabolic actions 
of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in osteocytes. Our study provides new evidence for 
the clinical application of BMP-7-overexpressed osteocytes."
1308,"Liver fibrosis, a common liver dysfunction with high morbidity and mortality 
rates, is the leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, for which 
there are no effective therapies. Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug that also 
has been showing therapeutic actions in many other diseases, including antiviral 
and anticancer actions, as well as treating metabolic diseases. Herein, we 
evaluated the function of ivermectin in regulating liver fibrosis. Firstly, 
carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-injected Balb/c mice were used to assess the 
antifibrosis effects of ivermectin in vivo. Further, CFSC, a rat hepatic 
stellate cell (HSC) line, was used to explore the function of ivermectin in HSC 
activation in vitro. The in vivo data showed that ivermectin administration 
alleviated histopathological changes, improved liver function, reduced collagen 
deposition, and downregulated the expression of profibrotic genes. 
Mechanistically, the ivermectin treatment inhibited intrahepatic macrophage 
accumulation and suppressed the production of proinflammatory factors. 
Importantly, the ivermectin administration significantly decreased the protein 
levels of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting 
that the antifibrotic effects of ivermectin are mainly due to the promotion of 
HSC deactivation. The present study demonstrates that ivermectin may be a 
potential therapeutic agent for the prevention of hepatic fibrosis."
1309,"The holothurian Eupentacta fraudatrix is capable of fully restoring its muscles 
after transverse dissection. Although the regeneration of these structures is 
well studied at the cellular level, the molecular basis of the process remains 
poorly understood. To identify genes that may be involved in the regulation of 
muscle regeneration, the transcriptome of the longitudinal muscle band of E. 
fraudatrix has been sequenced at different time periods post-injury. An analysis 
of the map of biological processes and pathways has shown that most genes 
associated with myogenesis decrease their expression during the regeneration. 
The only exception is the genes united by the GO term ""heart valve development"". 
This may indicate the antiquity of mechanisms of mesodermal structure 
transformation, which was co-opted into various morphogeneses in deuterostomes. 
Two groups of genes that play a key role in the regeneration have been analyzed: 
transcription factors and matrix metalloproteinases. A total of six 
transcription factor genes (Ef-HOX5, Ef-ZEB2, Ef-RARB, Ef-RUNX1, Ef-SOX17, and 
Ef-ZNF318) and seven matrix metalloproteinase genes (Ef-MMP11, Ef-MMP13, 
Ef-MMP13-1, Ef-MMP16-2, Ef-MMP16-3, Ef-MMP24, and Ef-MMP24-1) showing 
differential expression during myogenesis have been revealed. The identified 
genes are assumed to be involved in the muscle regeneration in holothurians."
1310,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, endogenous, non-coding, single-stranded 
RNAs that can negatively regulate the post-transcriptional expression of target 
genes. Among them, miR-15a/16 is involved in the regulation of the occurrence 
and development of fibrosis in the liver, lungs, heart, kidneys, and other 
organs, as well as systemic fibrotic diseases, affecting important cellular 
functions, such as cell transformation, the synthesis and degradation of 
extracellular matrix, and the release of fibrotic mediators. Therefore, this 
article reviews the biological characteristics of miR-15a/16 and the molecular 
mechanisms and functions of their dysregulation in fibrotic diseases."
1311,"Primary breast angiosarcoma, with de novo appearance and not associated with 
exposure to radiation or lymphedema, is a rare pathology representing less than 
0.05% of the neoplasms related to this organ. The pathology is characterized by 
its aggressiveness, poor prognosis, and difficulties in its differential 
diagnosis. This article reports the case of a 55-year-old white woman with no 
family history of cancer, with a rapidly growing mass in the left mammary gland 
that ulcerates and bleeds. It is confirmed as primary breast angiosarcoma by 
immunostaining in the tumor tissue for CD31, CD34, and FLI-1. In addition, a 
sample of neoplastic and healthy tissues is collected from the patient for RNA 
sequencing; the results are contrasted with a tissue sample from a patient with 
Luminal A subtype of breast cancer, as well as data from other cases of 
angiosarcoma available in public databases. These findings revealed a genetic 
profile associated with the immune and inflammatory response in the patient's 
sample when compared to available angiosarcoma data; these molecular patterns 
are consistent with other recent studies. Due to the rarity of the disease, the 
studies carried out on each patient contribute to the expanding knowledge of the 
etiology and molecular pathways that are still partially known and continue to 
be the subject of research. Aside from a comparative transcriptome study, this 
article aims to provide an update on the state of knowledge about this disease."
1312,"Metatranscriptomics has emerged as a very useful technology for the study of 
microbiomes from RNA-seq reads. This method provides additional information 
compared to the sequencing of ribosomal genes because the gene expression can 
also be analysed. In this work, we used the metatranscriptomic approach to study 
the whole microbiome of mussels, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and 
protozoans, by mapping the RNA-seq reads to custom assembly databases (including 
the genomes of microorganisms publicly available). This strategy allowed us not 
only to describe the diversity of microorganisms but also to relate the host 
transcriptome and microbiome, finding the genes more affected by the pathogen 
load. Although some bacteria abundant in the metatranscriptomic analysis were 
undetectable by 16S rRNA sequencing, a common core of the taxa was detected by 
both methodologies (62% of the metatranscriptomic detections were also 
identified by 16S rRNA sequencing, the Oceanospirillales, Flavobacteriales and 
Vibrionales orders being the most relevant). However, the differences in the 
microbiome composition were observed among different tissues of Mytilus 
galloprovincialis, with the fungal kingdom being especially diverse, or among 
molluscan species. These results confirm the potential of a meta-analysis of 
transcriptome data to obtain new information on the molluscs' microbiome."
1313,"ATM germline pathogenic variants were recently found enriched in high-risk 
melanoma patients. However, ATM loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has never been 
investigated in melanoma and, therefore, a causal association with melanoma 
development has not been established yet. The purpose of this study was to 
functionally characterize 13 germline ATM variants found in high-risk melanoma 
patients-and classified by in silico tools as pathogenic, uncertain 
significance, or benign-using multiple assays evaluating ATM/pATM expression 
and/or LOH in melanoma tissues and cell lines. We assessed ATM status by 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western Blot, Whole-Exome Sequencing/Copy Number 
Variation analysis, and RNA sequencing, supported by Sanger sequencing and 
microsatellite analyses. For most variants, IHC results matched those obtained 
with in silico classification and LOH analysis. Two pathogenic variants 
(p.Ser1135_Lys1192del and p.Ser1993ArgfsTer23) showed LOH and complete loss of 
ATM activation in melanoma. Two variants of unknown significance (p.Asn358Ile 
and p.Asn796His) showed reduced expression and LOH, suggestive of a deleterious 
effect. This study, showing a classic two-hit scenario in a well-known tumor 
suppressor gene, supports the inclusion of melanoma in the ATM-related cancer 
spectrum."
1314,"Hyperpigmentation is a skin condition where patches of skin become darker in 
color due to excess melanin production upon UV exposure leading to melasma, 
which are lentigines or post inflammatory hyperpigmentation that psychologically 
affecting a great number of people. The present study investigates the 
anti-melanogenic effect of Butyroside D and the underling mechanism. After the 
confirmation of the non-cytotoxic effect of Butyroside D on B16F10 cells, we 
proceeded with analyzing the impact of the treatment at low and high 
concentration (i.e., 0.2 μM and 2 μM) using gene profiling analysis and examined 
the differentiation in gene expression. Our results identify cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP), Wnt/β-catenin and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) 
signaling pathways to be downregulated upon treatment with Butyroside D. These 
pathways were targeted to further validate the effect of Butyroside D on 
membrane receptors melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and receptor tyrosine kinase 
(c-Kit), related microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and 
consequently tyrosinase (TYR), and tyrosine-related protein-1 (TYRP-1) that were 
all shown to be downregulated and, therefore, leading to the repression of 
melanin biosynthesis. Finally, the anti-melanogenic effect of Butyroside D was 
confirmed on human epidermal melanocytes (HEM) cells by inhibiting the 
activation of cAMP pathway generally mediated through α-melanocyte-stimulating 
hormone (α-MSH) and MC1R. Overall, this study suggests the potential 
applicability of this purified compound for the prevention of hyperpigmentation 
conditions."
1315,"Intramolecular guanine quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical nucleic acid 
structures formed by four guanine (G)-rich tracts that assemble into a core of 
stacked planar tetrads. G4-forming DNA sequences are enriched in gene promoters 
and are implicated in the control of gene expression. Most G4-forming DNA 
contains more G residues than can simultaneously be incorporated into the core 
resulting in a variety of different possible G4 structures. Although this kind 
of structural polymorphism is well recognized in the literature, there remain 
unanswered questions regarding possible connections between G4 polymorphism and 
biological function. Here we report a detailed bioinformatic survey of G4 
polymorphism in human gene promoter regions. Our analysis is based on 
identifying G4-containing regions (G4CRs), which we define as stretches of DNA 
in which every residue can form part of a G4. We found that G4CRs with higher 
degrees of polymorphism are more tightly clustered near transcription sites and 
tend to contain G4s with shorter loops and bulges. Furthermore, we found that 
G4CRs with well-characterized biological functions tended to be longer and more 
polymorphic than genome-wide averages. These results represent new evidence 
linking G4 polymorphism to biological function and provide new criteria for 
identifying biologically relevant G4-forming regions from genomic data."
1316,"Protein synthesis is tightly regulated by both gene-specific and global 
mechanisms to match the metabolic and proliferative demands of the cell. While 
the regulation of global protein synthesis in response to mitogen or stress 
signals is relatively well understood in multiple experimental systems, how 
different cell types fine-tune their basal protein synthesis rate is not known. 
In a previous study, we showed that resting B and T lymphocytes exhibit dramatic 
differences in their metabolic profile, with implications for their 
post-activation function. Here, we show that resting B cells, despite being 
quiescent, exhibit increased protein synthesis in vivo as well as ex vivo. The 
increased protein synthesis in B cells is driven by mTORC1, which exhibits an 
intermediate level of activation in these cells when compared with resting T 
cells and activated B cells. A comparative analysis of the transcriptome and 
translatome of these cells indicates that the genes encoding the MHC Class II 
molecules and their chaperone CD74 are highly translated in B cells. These data 
suggest that the translatome of B cells shows enrichment for genes associated 
with antigen processing and presentation. Even though the B cells exhibit higher 
mTORC1 levels, they prevent the translational activation of TOP mRNAs, which are 
mostly constituted by ribosomal proteins and other translation factors, by 
upregulating 4EBP1 levels. This mechanism may keep the protein synthesis 
machinery under check while enabling higher levels of translation in B cells."
1317,"G-quadruplexes are nucleotide sequences present in the promoter region of 
numerous oncogenes, having a key role in the suppression of gene transcription. 
Recently, the binding of anthraquinones from Aloe vera to G-quadruplex 
structures has been studied through various physico-chemical techniques. 
Intrigued by the reported results, we investigated the affinity of aloe emodin, 
aloe emodin-8-glucoside, and aloin to selected G-quadruplex nucleotide sequences 
by NMR spectroscopy. The structural determinants for the formation of the 
ligand/nucleotide complexes were elucidated and a model of the interactions 
between the tested compounds and C-Kit and c-Myc G-quadruplex DNA structures was 
built by integrated NMR and molecular modeling studies. Overall, the obtained 
results confirmed and implemented the previously reported findings, pointing out 
the complementarity of the different approaches and their contribution to a more 
detailed overview of the ligand/nucleotide complex formation. Furthermore, the 
proposed models of interaction could pave the way to the design of new 
nature-derived compounds endowed with increased G-quadruplex stabilizing 
activity."
1318,"ALS-linked mutations induce aberrant conformations within the SOD1 protein that 
are thought to underlie the pathogenic mechanism of SOD1-mediated ALS. Although 
clinical trials are underway for gene silencing of SOD1, these approaches reduce 
both wild-type and mutated forms of SOD1. Here, we sought to develop anti-SOD1 
nanobodies with selectivity for mutant and misfolded forms of human SOD1 over 
wild-type SOD1. Characterization of two anti-SOD1 nanobodies revealed that these 
biologics stabilize mutant SOD1 in vitro. Further, SOD1 expression levels were 
enhanced and the physiological subcellular localization of mutant SOD1 was 
restored upon co-expression of anti-SOD1 nanobodies in immortalized cells. In 
human motor neurons harboring the SOD1 A4V mutation, anti-SOD1 nanobody 
expression promoted neurite outgrowth, demonstrating a protective effect of 
anti-SOD1 nanobodies in otherwise unhealthy cells. In vitro assays revealed that 
an anti-SOD1 nanobody exhibited selectivity for human mutant SOD1 over 
endogenous murine SOD1, thus supporting the preclinical utility of anti-SOD1 
nanobodies for testing in animal models of ALS. In sum, the anti-SOD1 nanobodies 
developed and presented herein represent viable biologics for further 
preclinical testing in human and mouse models of ALS."
1319,"Inherited retinal diseases can result from various genetic defects and are one 
of the leading causes for blindness in the working-age population. The present 
study aims to provide a comprehensive description of changes in retinal 
structure associated with phenotypic disease entities and underlying genetic 
mutations. Full macular spectral domain optical coherence tomography scans were 
obtained and manually segmented in 16 patients with retinitis pigmentosa, 7 
patients with cone-rod dystrophy, and 7 patients with Stargardt disease, as well 
as 23 age- and sex-matched controls without retinal disease, to assess retinal 
layer thicknesses. As indicated by generalized least squares models, all IRDs 
were associated with retinal thinning (p &lt; 0.001), especially of the outer 
nuclear layer (ONL, p &lt; 0.001). Except for the retinal nerve fiber layer, 
such thinning was associated with a reduced visual acuity (p &lt; 0.001). These 
advances in our understanding of ultrastructural retinal changes are important 
for the development of gene-, cell-, and optogenetic therapy. Longitudinal 
studies are warranted to describe the temporal component of those changes."
1320,"Klebsiella&amp;nbsp;pneumoniae is not only a human and animal opportunistic 
pathogen, but a food-borne pathogen. Cross-kingdom infection has been focused on 
since K. pneumoniae was identified as the pathogen of maize, banana, and 
pomegranate. Although the pathogenicity of K. pneumoniae strains (from ditch 
water, maize, and human) on plant and mice has been confirmed, there are no 
reports to explain the molecular mechanisms of the pathogen. This study 
uncovered the K. pneumoniae KpC4 isolated from maize top rot for the 
determination of various virulence genes and resistance genes. At least thirteen 
plant disease-causing genes are found to be involved in the disruption of plant 
defense. Among them, rcsB is responsible for causing disease in both plants and 
animals. The novel sequence types provide solid evidence that the pathogen 
invades plant and has robust ecological adaptability. It is imperative to 
perform further studies on the verification of these KpC4 genes' functions to 
understand the molecular mechanisms involved in plant-pathogen interactions."
1321,"Nodulation is a hallmark yet non-universal characteristic of legumes. It is 
unknown whether the mechanisms underlying nitrogen-fixing symbioses evolved 
within legumes and the broader nitrogen-fixing clade (NFC) repeatedly de novo or 
based on common ancestral pathways. Ten new transcriptomes representing members 
from the Cercidoideae and Caesalpinioideae subfamilies were supplemented with 
published omics data from 65 angiosperms, to investigate how gene content 
correlates with nodulation capacity within Fabaceae and the NFC. Orthogroup 
analysis categorized annotated genes into 64150 orthogroups, of which 19 were 
significantly differentially represented between nodulating versus 
non-nodulating NFC species and were most commonly absent in nodulating taxa. The 
distribution of six over-represented orthogroups within Viridiplantae 
representatives suggested that genomic evolution events causing gene family 
expansions, including whole-genome duplications (WGDs), were unlikely to have 
facilitated the development of stable symbioses within Fabaceae as a whole. 
Instead, an absence of representation of 13 orthogroups indicated that losses of 
genes involved in trichome development, defense and wounding responses were 
strongly associated with rhizobial symbiosis in legumes. This finding provides 
novel evidence of a lineage-specific predisposition for the evolution and/or 
stabilization of nodulation in Fabaceae, in which a loss of pathogen resistance 
genes may have allowed for stable mutualistic interactions with rhizobia."
1322,"Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disorder. Rheum 
palmatum L. is a common traditional medicinal herb with anti-inflammatory and 
immunomodulatory activities. This study aimed to investigate the anti-psoriatic 
effects of the ethanolic extract from R. palmatum L. (RPE) and its chemical 
constituents, as well as the mechanisms underlying their therapeutic 
significance. An imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like mouse model was used to 
examine the anti-psoriatic effect of RPE in vivo. Network pharmacological 
analysis was performed to investigate the potential targets and related pathways 
of the RPE components, including rhein, emodin, chrysophanol, aloe-emodin, and 
physcion. The anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of these 
components were examined using in vitro models. Topical application of RPE 
alleviated psoriasis-like symptoms and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines 
and proliferation markers in the skin. Network pharmacological analysis revealed 
that RPE components target 20 genes that are linked to psoriasis-related 
pathways, such as IL-17, MAPK, and TNF signaling pathways. Among the five 
components of RPE, rhein and emodin showed inhibitory effects on TNF-α and IL-17 
production in EL-4 cells, attenuated the production of CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL20, and 
MMP9, and reduced proliferation in HaCaT cells. Chrysophanol, aloe-emodin, and 
physcion were less effective than rhein and emodin in suppressing inflammatory 
responses and keratinocyte proliferation. The effects of these compounds might 
occur through the inhibition of the ERK, STAT3, and NF-κB signaling pathways. 
This study suggested the anti-psoriatic effect of RPE, with rhein and emodin as 
the main contributors that regulate multiple signaling pathways."
1323,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease 
with a wide range of clinical expressions. The kidney is often affected, usually 
within 5 years of the onset of SLE, and lupus nephropathy (LN) carries a high 
risk for increased morbidity. The clinical heterogeneity of the disease is 
accompanied by complex disturbances affecting the immune system with 
inflammation and tissue damage due to loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens and 
the deposition of immune complexes in tissues. Several studies have reported 
that in human SLE, there is an important role of the Type-I-interferons (INF) 
system suggested by the upregulation of INF-inducible genes observed in serial 
gene expression microarray studies. This review aims to describe the 
transduction pathways of Type-I-interferons, in particular INFα, and its 
immune-regulatory function in the pathogenesis of SLE and, in particular, in LN. 
In addition, recent novelties concerning biologic therapy in LN will be 
discussed."
1324,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is usually diagnosed late due to its nonspecific symptoms 
and lack of reliable tools for early diagnostics and screening. OC studies 
concentrate on the search for new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This study 
aimed to validate the MFAP5 gene, and its encoded protein, as a potential 
prognostic biomarker. In our previous study, we found that patients with 
high-grade serous OC who had higher MFAP5 mRNA levels had shorter survival, as 
compared with those with lower levels. Here, we used the Kaplan-Meier Plotter 
and CSIOVDB online tools to analyze possible associations of MFAP5 expression 
with survival and other clinico-pathological features. In these analyses, higher 
MFAP5 mRNA expression was observed in the more advanced FIGO stages and 
high-grade tumors, and was significantly associated with shorter overall and 
progression-free survival. Next, we analyzed the expression of the MFAP5 protein 
by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 108 OC samples and tissue arrays. Stronger 
MFAP5 expression was associated with stronger desmoplastic reaction and serous 
vs. non-serous histology. We found no significant correlation between IHC 
results and survival, although there was a trend toward shorter survival in 
patients with the highest IHC scores. We searched for co-expressed 
genes/proteins using cBioPortal and analyzed potential MFAP5 interaction 
networks with the STRING tool. MFAP5 was shown to interact with many 
extracellular matrix proteins, and was connected to the Notch signaling pathway. 
Therefore, although not suitable as a prognostic biomarker for evaluation with a 
simple diagnostic tool like IHC, MFAP5 is worth further studies as a possible 
therapeutic target."
1325,"Unhealthy alcohol consumption is recognized as a leading contributory factor to 
mortality and disability. In addition to other factors, taste sensation also 
mediates alcohol intake. The orosensation provoked by alcoholic drinks may vary 
across individuals and may be responsible for differences in preference for 
alcoholic beverages. Thus, individual genetic variability of taste preference 
may have an impact on alcohol consumption practices. The present review aimed to 
explore the associations between different taste preference polymorphisms and 
alcohol consumption behavior. Based on the PRISMA statement, the three databases 
PubMed, Web of Science and ProQuest Central were searched to identify articles 
and the Q-Genie tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. 
Among the 17 studies included in this review, 5 and 12 were of good and moderate 
quality, respectively. Most of the studies analyzed TAS2R38 (taste 2 receptor 
member 38) rs713598, rs1726866, rs10246939 polymorphisms. Due to the 
inconclusive findings on these variants and the very limited number of studies 
on other polymorphisms, additional extensive research is recommended to 
replicate the existing findings, to generate new knowledge to enhance our 
understanding of the complexity of alcohol consumption behavior and to aid the 
development of personalized recommendations on unhealthy alcohol use."
1326,"Alkanes are widespread in the ocean, and Alcanivorax is one of the most 
ubiquitous alkane-degrading bacteria in the marine ecosystem. Small RNAs (sRNAs) 
are usually at the heart of regulatory pathways, but sRNA-mediated alkane 
metabolic adaptability still remains largely unknown due to the difficulties of 
identification. Here, differential RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) modified with a 
size selection (~50-nt to 500-nt) strategy was used to generate high-resolution 
sRNAs profiling in the model species Alcanivorax dieselolei B-5 under alkane 
(n-hexadecane) and non-alkane (acetate) conditions. As a result, we identified 
549 sRNA candidates at single-nucleotide resolution of 5'-ends, 63.4% of which 
are with transcription start sites (TSSs), and 36.6% of which are with 
processing sites (PSSs) at the 5'-ends. These sRNAs originate from almost any 
location in the genome, regardless of intragenic (65.8%), antisense (20.6%) and 
intergenic (6.2%) regions, and RNase E may function in the maturation of sRNAs. 
Most sRNAs locally distribute across the 15 reference genomes of Alcanivorax, 
and only 7.5% of sRNAs are broadly conserved in this genus. Expression responses 
to the alkane of several core conserved sRNAs, including 6S RNA, M1 RNA and 
tmRNA, indicate that they may participate in alkane metabolisms and result in 
more actively global transcription, RNA processing and stresses mitigation. Two 
novel CsrA-related sRNAs are identified, which may be involved in the 
translational activation of alkane metabolism-related genes by sequestering the 
global repressor CsrA. The relationships of sRNAs with the characterized genes 
of alkane sensing (ompS), chemotaxis (mcp, cheR, cheW2), transporting (ompT1, 
ompT2, ompT3) and hydroxylation (alkB1, alkB2, almA) were created based on the 
genome-wide predicted sRNA-mRNA interactions. Overall, the sRNA landscape lays 
the ground for uncovering cryptic regulations in critical marine bacterium, 
among which both the core and species-specific sRNAs are implicated in the 
alkane adaptive metabolisms."
1327,"Recently, synthetic polymers have attracted great interest in the field of 
biomedical science. Among these, polyphosphazenes (PPZs) are regarded as one of 
the most promising materials, due to their structural flexibility and 
biodegradability compared to other materials. PPZs have been developed through 
numerous studies. In particular, multi-functionalized PPZs have been proven to 
be potential biomaterials in various forms, such as nanoparticles (NPs) and 
hydrogels, through the introduction of various functional groups. Thus, PPZs 
have been applied for the delivery of therapeutic molecules (low molecular 
weight drugs, genes and proteins), bioimaging, phototherapy, bone regeneration, 
dental liners, modifiers and medical devices. The main goal of the present 
review is to highlight the recent and the most notable existing PPZ-based 
biomaterials for aforementioned applications, with future perspectives in mind."
1328,"Uremic toxins and gut dysbiosis in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) can 
induce gut leakage, causing the translocation of gut microbial molecules into 
the systemic circulation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) are 
the major gut microbial molecules of Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, 
respectively, and can induce inflammation in several organs. Here, the fibrosis 
in the kidney, liver, and heart was investigated in oral C. 
albicans-administered 5/6 nephrectomized (Candida-5/6 Nx) mice. At 20 weeks post 
5/6 Nx, Candida-5/6 Nx mice demonstrated increased 24 h proteinuria, liver 
enzymes, and serum cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10), but not weight loss, 
systolic blood pressure, hematocrit, serum creatinine, or gut-derived uremic 
toxins (TMAO and indoxyl sulfate), compared to in 5/6 Nx alone. The gut leakage 
in Candida-5/6 Nx was more severe, as indicated by FITC-dextran assay, 
endotoxemia, and serum BG. The areas of fibrosis from histopathology, along with 
the upregulated gene expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) and Dectin-1, 
the receptors for LPS and BG, respectively, were higher in the kidney, liver, 
and heart. In vitro, LPS combined with BG increased the supernatant IL-6 and 
TNF-α, upregulated the genes of pro-inflammation and pro-fibrotic processes, 
Dectin-1, and TLR-4 in renal tubular (HK-2) cells and hepatocytes (HepG2), when 
compared with LPS or BG alone. This supported the pro-inflammation-induced 
fibrosis and the possible LPS-BG additive effects on kidney and liver fibrosis. 
In conclusion, uremia-induced leaky gut causes the translocation of gut LPS and 
BG into circulation, which activates the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic 
pathways, causing internal organ fibrosis. Our results support the crosstalk 
among several organs in CKD through a leaky gut."
1329,"The papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) is a subfamily of cysteine proteases 
that plays an important role in leaf senescence, and some of its members are 
involved in the regulation of plant growth and development under stress. In this 
study, we cloned a new gene, ZmSAG39, from maize. Expression profile analysis 
showed that ZmSAG39 was induced by darkness and drought treatments. In addition, 
the ZmSAG39 overexpression in maize accelerated the senescence of maize leaves 
under darkness and drought treatments. However, the knockout of ZmSAG39 in maize 
enhanced the resistance of maize to darkness and drought stresses and reduced 
the degree of senescence of maize leaves. Under drought stress, compared with WT 
plants, the knockout lines had a higher seed germination rate, seedling survival 
rate and chlorophyll content, and lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and 
malondialdehyde (MDA) content. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) 
analysis showed that ZmSAG39 negatively regulated some stress-related genes but 
positively regulated senescence-related genes under darkness and drought stress 
conditions. To summarize, these results indicate that ZmSAG39 is a 
senescence-related gene and plays a negative role in response to darkness and 
drought stresses. This study laid a theoretical foundation for the innovation of 
maize germplasm resources with high quality, high yield and strong stress 
resistance."
1330,"The technique of pig cloning holds great promise for the livestock industry, 
life science, and biomedicine. However, the prenatal death rate of cloned pig 
embryos is extremely high, resulting in a very low cloning efficiency. This 
limits the development and application of pig cloning. In this study, we 
utilized embryo biopsy combined with microproteomics to identify potential 
factors causing the developmental arrest in cloned pig embryos. We verified the 
roles of two potential regulators, PDCD6 and PLK1, in cloned pig embryo 
development. We found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of PDCD6 reduced mRNA and 
protein expression levels of the pro-apoptotic gene, CASP3, in cloned pig 
embryos. PDCD6 knockdown also increased the cleavage rate and blastocyst rate of 
cloned porcine embryos. Overexpression of PLK1 via mRNA microinjection also 
improved the cleavage rate of cloned pig embryos. This study provided a new 
strategy to identify key factors responsible for the developmental defects in 
cloned pig embryos. It also helped establish new methods to improve pig cloning 
efficiency, specifically by correcting the expression pattern of PDCD6 and PLK1 
in cloned pig embryos."
1331,"Breast cancer is among the most common cancers in women, second to skin cancer. 
Mammary gland development can influence breast cancer development in later life. 
Processes such as proliferation, invasion, and migration during mammary gland 
development can often mirror processes found in breast cancer. MicroRNAs 
(miRNAs), small, non-coding RNAs, can repress post-transcriptional RNA 
expression and can regulate up to 80% of all genes. Expression of miRNAs play a 
key role in mammary gland development, and aberrant expression can initiate or 
promote breast cancer. Here, we review the role of miRNAs in mammary development 
and breast cancer, and potential parallel roles. A total of 32 miRNAs were found 
to be expressed in both mammary gland development and breast cancer. These 
miRNAs are involved in proliferation, metastasis, invasion, and apoptosis in 
both processes. Some miRNAs were found to have contradictory roles, possibly due 
to their ability to target many genes at once. Investigation of miRNAs and their 
role in mammary gland development may inform about their role in breast cancer. 
In particular, by studying miRNA in development, mechanisms and potential 
targets for breast cancer treatment may be elucidated."
1332,"Inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (iCAFs) are closely related to 
progression, anticancer therapeutic resistance, and poor prognosis of bladder 
cancer (BCa). However, the functional role of iCAFs in BCa has been poorly 
studied. In our study, two BCa scRNA-seq datasets (GSE130001 and GSE146137) were 
obtained and integrated by the Seurat pipeline. Based on reported markers 
(COL1A1 and PDGFRA), iCAFs were identified and the related signature of 278 
markers was developed. Following unsupervised consensus clustering, two 
molecular subtypes of TCGA-BLCA were identified and characterized by distinct 
dysregulated cancer hallmarks, immunological tumor microenvironments, prognoses, 
responses to chemotherapy/immunotherapy, and stemness. Subsequently, the 
robustness of the signature-based clustering, in terms of prognosis and 
therapeutic response prediction, was validated in a GEO-meta cohort with seven 
independent GEO datasets of 519 BCa patients, and three immune checkpoint 
inhibitor (ICI)-treated cohorts. Considering the heterogeneity, re-clustering of 
iCAFs was performed and a subpopulation, named ""LOXL2+ iCAFs"", was identified. 
Co-culture CM derived from LOXL2 overexpression/silencing CAFs with T24 cells 
revealed that overexpression of LOXL2 in CAFs promoted while silencing LOXL2 
inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of T24 cells through IL32. 
Moreover, the positive correlation between LOXL2 and CD206, an M2 macrophage 
polarization marker, has been observed and validated. Collectively, integrated 
single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing analyses revealed an iCAF-related signature 
that can predict prognosis and response to immunotherapy for BCa. Additionally, 
the hub gene LOXL2 may serve as a promising target for BCa treatment."
1333,"Environmental pollution of heavy metals has received growing attention in recent 
years. Heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and mercury can cause physiological 
and morphological disturbances which adversely affect the growth and quality of 
crops. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) can accumulate high contents of heavy metals 
in its edible parts. Understanding wheat response to heavy metal stress and its 
management in decreasing heavy metal uptake and accumulation may help to improve 
its growth and grain quality. Very recently, emerging advances in heavy metal 
toxicity and phytoremediation methods to reduce heavy metal pollution have been 
made in wheat. Especially, the molecular mechanisms of wheat under heavy metal 
stress are increasingly being recognized. In this review, we focus on the 
recently described epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, 
ionomics and multi-omics combination, as well as functional genes uncovering 
heavy metal stress in wheat. The findings in this review provide some insights 
into challenges and future recommendations for wheat under heavy metal stress."
1334,"Transposable elements (TEs) comprise a considerable proportion of insect genomic 
DNA; how they contribute to genome structure and organization is still poorly 
understood. Here, we present an analysis of the TE repertoire in the 
chromosome-level genome assembly of Rhus gall aphid Schlechtendalia chinensis. 
The TE fractions are composed of at least 32 different superfamilies and many 
TEs from different families were transcriptionally active in the S. chinensis 
genome. Furthermore, different types of transposase-derived proteins were also 
found in the S. chinensis genome. We also provide insight into the TEs related 
insertional inactivation, and exogenization of TEs in functional genes. We 
considered that the presence of TE fragments in the introns of functional genes 
could impact the activity of functional genes, and a large number of TE 
fragments in introns could lead to the indirect inactivation of functional 
genes. The present study will be beneficial in understanding the role and impact 
of TEs in genomic evolution of their hosts."
1335,"In plants, the shikimate pathway is responsible for the production of aromatic 
amino acids L-tryptophan, L-phenylalanine, and L-tyrosine. L-Phenylalanine is 
the upstream substrate of flavonoid and anthocyanin synthesis. Shikimate kinase 
(SK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of the C3 hydroxyl group of shikimate to 
produce 3-phosphate shikimate (S3P), the fifth step of the shikimate pathway. 
However, whether SK participates in flavonoid and anthocyanin synthesis is 
unknown. This study characterized the single-copy PhSK gene in the petunia 
(Petunia hybrida) genome. PhSK was localized in chloroplasts. PhSK showed a high 
transcription level in corollas, especially in the coloring stage of flower 
buds. Suppression of PhSK changed flower color and shape, reduced the content of 
anthocyanins, and changed the flavonoid metabolome profile in petunia. 
Surprisingly, PhSK silencing caused a reduction in the shikimate, a substrate of 
PhSK. Further qPCR analysis showed that PhSK silencing resulted in a reduction 
in the mRNA level of PhDHQ/SDH, which encodes the protein catalyzing the third 
and fourth steps of the shikimate pathway, showing a feedback regulation 
mechanism of gene expression in the shikimate pathway."
1336,"Construction of a physical chromosome map of a species is important for 
positional cloning, targeted marker development, fine mapping of genes, 
selection of candidate genes for molecular breeding, as well as understanding 
the genome organization. The genomic libraries in the form of bacterial 
artificial chromosome (BAC) clones are also a very useful resource for physical 
mapping and identification and isolation of full-length genes and the related 
cis acting elements. Some BAC-FISH based studies reported in the past were gene 
based physical chromosome maps of Clarias magur (magur) to understand the genome 
organization of the species and to establish the relationships with other 
species in respect to genes' organization and evolution in the past. In the 
present study, we generated end sequences of the BAC clones and analyzed those 
end sequences within the scaffolds of the draft genome of magur to identify and 
map the genes bioinformatically for each clone. A total of 36 clones mostly 
possessing genes were identified and used in probe construction and their 
subsequent hybridization on the metaphase chromosomes of magur. This study 
successfully mapped all 36 specific clones on 16 chromosome pairs, out of 25 
pairs of magur chromosomes. These clones are now recognized as 
chromosome-specific makers, which are an aid in individual chromosome 
identification and fine assembly of the genome sequence, and will ultimately 
help in developing anchored genes' map on the chromosomes of C. magur for 
understanding their organization, inheritance of important fishery traits and 
evolution of magur with respect to channel catfish, zebrafish and other species."
1337,"Emerging evidence from research or clinical studies reported that ABCG2 
(ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2) interrelates with multidrug 
resistance (MDR) development in cancers. However, no comprehensive pan-cancer 
analysis is available at present. Therefore, we explore multiple databases, such 
as TCGA to investigate the potential therapeutic roles of ABCG2 across 33 
different tumors. ABCG2 is expressed on a lower level in most cancers and shows 
a protective effect. For example, a lower expression level of ABCG2 was 
detrimental to the survival of adrenocortical carcinoma (TCGA-ACC), glioblastoma 
multiforme (GBM), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) patients. 
Distinct associations exist between ABCG2 expression and stemness scores, 
microenvironmental scores, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor 
mutational burden (TMB) of tumor patients. We observed a significant positive 
correlation between the ABCG2 mutation site and prognosis in uterine corpus 
endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) patients. Moreover, transmembrane transporter 
activity and hormone biosynthetic-associated functions were found to be involved 
in the functionality of ABCG2 and its related genes. The cDNAs of cancer cell 
lines were collected to detect exon mutation sequences and to analyze ABCG2 mRNA 
expression. The mRNA expression level of ABCG2 showed a significant difference 
among spheres and drug-resistant cancer cell lines compared with their 
corresponding adherent cancer cell lines in six types of cancer. This pan-cancer 
study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive understanding of the 
multifunctionality of ABCG2 and unveils further details of the potential 
therapeutic role of ABCG2 in pan-cancer."
1338,"In plants, other cells can express totipotency in addition to the zygote, thus 
resulting in embryo differentiation; this appears evident in apomictic and 
epiphyllous plants. According to Haberlandt's theory, all plant cells can 
regenerate a complete plant if the nucleus and the membrane system are intact. 
In fact, under in vitro conditions, ectopic embryos and adventitious shoots can 
develop from many organs of the mature plant body. We are beginning to 
understand how determination processes are regulated and how cell specialization 
occurs. However, we still need to unravel the mechanisms whereby a cell 
interprets its position, decides its fate, and communicates it to others. The 
induction of somatic embryogenesis might be based on a plant growth regulator 
signal (auxin) to determine an appropriate cellular environment and other 
factors, including stress and ectopic expression of embryo or meristem identity 
transcription factors (TFs). Still, we are far from having a complete view of 
the regulatory genes, their target genes, and their action hierarchy. As in 
animals, epigenetic reprogramming also plays an essential role in 
re-establishing the competence of differentiated cells to undergo somatic 
embryogenesis. Herein, we describe the functions of WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 
(WOX) transcription factors in regulating the differentiation-dedifferentiation 
cell process and in the developmental phase of in vitro regenerated adventitious 
structures."
1339,"This study aimed to evaluate if single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 
vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene are associated with gene expression in human 
periodontal ligament (hPDL) fibroblasts under simulated orthodontic compressive 
force. hPDL samples from 57 patients were used. A physiological compressive 
strain was performed to simulate orthodontic tooth movement in pressure areas 
under cell culture conditions. The RNA from hPDL fibroblasts was isolated to 
determine the relative gene expression (mRNA) of the VDR. The DNA was also 
isolated for the genotyping analysis of five SNPs in the VDR gene: BglI 
(rs739837, G/T), BsmI (rs1544410, T/C), ApaI (rs7975232, A/C), FokI (rs2228570, 
A/G), and TaqI (rs731236, A/G). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used for 
both analyses. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare VDR expression among 
genotypes of each SNP. A linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate 
SNP-SNP interaction. An established alpha of 5% was used. The relative mRNA VDR 
expression according to the genotypes in the SNPs BglI, BsmI, ApaI, FokI, and 
TaqI was not statistically significantly different (p &gt; 0.05). The SNP-SNP 
interaction evaluated by regression analysis did not demonstrate any 
statistically significant association. No association was observed (p &gt; 
0.05). In conclusion, the SNPs BglI (rs739837), BsmI (rs1544410), ApaI 
(rs7975232), FokI (rs2228570), and TaqI (rs731236) did not show an impact on VDR 
gene expression in hPDL fibroblasts under simulated orthodontic compressive 
force."
1340,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have been approved 
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, the brain actions 
of these drugs are not properly established. We used post mortem microdissected 
human hypothalamic samples for RT-qPCR and Western blotting. For in situ 
hybridization histochemistry and immunolabelling, parallel cryosections were 
prepared from the hypothalamus. We developed in situ hybridization probes for 
human GLP-1R and oxytocin. In addition, GLP-1 and oxytocin were visualized by 
immunohistochemistry. Radioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry revealed 
abundant GLP-1R labelling in the human paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus 
(PVN), particularly in its magnocellular subdivision (PVNmc). Quantitative 
analysis of the mRNA signal demonstrated increased GLP-1R expression in the 
PVNmc in post mortem hypothalamic samples from T2DM subjects as compared to 
controls, while there was no difference in the expression level of GLP-1R in the 
other subdivisions of the PVN, the hypothalamic dorsomedial and infundibular 
nuclei. Our results in the PVN were confirmed by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, we 
demonstrated by Western blot technique that the GLP-1R protein level was also 
elevated in the PVN of T2DM patients. GLP-1 fibre terminals were also observed 
in the PVNmc closely apposing oxytocin neurons using immunohistochemistry. The 
data suggest that GLP-1 activates GLP-1Rs in the PVNmc and that GLP-1R is 
elevated in T2DM patients, which may be related to the dysregulation of feeding 
behaviour and glucose homeostasis in T2DM."
1341,"The loss of seed shattering is an important event in crop domestication, and 
elucidating the genetic mechanisms underlying seed shattering can help reduce 
yield loss during crop production. This study is the first to systematically 
identify and analyse the BELL family of transcription factor-encoding genes in 
Chinese wild rice (Zizania latifolia). ZlqSH1a (Zla04G033720) and ZlqSH1b 
(Zla02G027130) were identified as key candidate genes involved in seed 
shattering in Z. latifolia. These genes were involved in regulating the 
development of the abscission layer (AL) and were located in the nucleus of the 
cell. Over-expression of ZlqSH1a and ZlqSH1b resulted in a complete AL between 
the grain and pedicel and significantly enhanced seed shattering after grain 
maturation in rice. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that 172 genes were 
differentially expressed between the wild type (WT) and the two transgenic 
(ZlqSH1a and ZlqSH1b over-expressing) plants. Three of the differentially 
expressed genes related to seed shattering were validated using qRT-PCR 
analysis. These results indicate that ZlqSH1a and ZlqSH1b are involved in AL 
development in rice grains, thereby regulating seed shattering. Our results 
could facilitate the genetic improvement of seed-shattering behaviour in Z. 
latifolia and other cereal crops."
1342,"Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is an important oil crop and a major source of 
tocopherols, also known as vitamin E, in human nutrition. Enhancing the quality 
and composition of fatty acids (FAs) and tocopherols in seeds has long been a 
target for rapeseed breeding. The gene γ-Tocopherol methyltransferase (γ-TMT) 
encodes an enzyme catalysing the conversion of γ-tocopherol to α-tocopherol, 
which has the highest biological activity. However, the genetic basis of γ-TMT 
in B. napus seeds remains unclear. In the present study, BnaC02.TMT.a, one 
paralogue of Brassica napus γ-TMT, was isolated from the B. napus cultivar 
""Zhongshuang11"" by nested PCR, and two homozygous transgenic overexpression 
lines were further characterised. Our results demonstrated that the 
overexpression of BnaC02.TMT.a mediated an increase in the α- and total 
tocopherol content in transgenic B. napus seeds. Interestingly, the FA 
composition was also altered in the transgenic plants; a reduction in the levels 
of oleic acid and an increase in the levels of linoleic acid and linolenic acid 
were observed. Consistently, BnaC02.TMT.a promoted the expression of BnFAD2 and 
BnFAD3, which are involved in the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids 
during seed development. In addition, BnaC02.TMT.a enhanced the tolerance to 
salt stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) during seed germination 
in B. napus. Our results suggest that BnaC02.TMT.a could affect the tocopherol 
content and FA composition and play a positive role in regulating the rapeseed 
response to salt stress by modulating the ROS scavenging system. This study 
broadens our understanding of the function of the Bnγ-TMT gene and provides a 
novel strategy for genetic engineering in rapeseed breeding."
1343,"Medicinal plants produce important substrates for their adaptation and defenses 
against environmental factors and, at the same time, are used for traditional 
medicine and industrial additives. Plants have relatively little in the way of 
secondary metabolites via biosynthesis. Recently, the whole-genome sequencing of 
medicinal plants and the identification of secondary metabolite production were 
revolutionized by the rapid development and cheap cost of sequencing technology. 
Advances in functional genomics, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
metabolomics, pave the way for discoveries in secondary metabolites and related 
key genes. The multi-omics approaches can offer tremendous insight into the 
variety, distribution, and development of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). 
Although many reviews have reported on the plant and medicinal plant genome, 
chemistry, and pharmacology, there is no review giving a comprehensive report 
about the medicinal plant genome and multi-omics approaches to study the 
biosynthesis pathway of secondary metabolites. Here, we introduce the medicinal 
plant genome and the application of multi-omics tools for identifying genes 
related to the biosynthesis pathway of secondary metabolites. Moreover, we 
explore comparative genomics and polyploidy for gene family analysis in 
medicinal plants. This study promotes medicinal plant genomics, which 
contributes to the biosynthesis and screening of plant substrates and 
plant-based drugs and prompts the research efficiency of traditional medicine."
1344,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic metabolic disease 
manifested in hepatic steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, etc., which affects 
over one-quarter of the population around the world. Since no effective 
therapeutic drugs are available to cope with this widespread epidemic, the 
functional research of genes with altered expression during NAFLD helps 
understand the pathogenesis of this disease and the development of new potential 
therapeutic targets for drugs. In the current work, we discovered via the 
analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset that cysteine sulfinic 
acid decarboxylase (CSAD) decreased significantly in NAFLD patients, which was 
also confirmed in multiple NAFLD mouse models (HFD-fed C57BL/6J, db/db and 
HFHFrHC-fed C57BL/6J mice). Next, CSAD's function in the progression of NAFLD 
was explored using AAV-mediated liver-directed gene overexpression in an HFD-fed 
mouse model, where the overexpression of CSAD in the liver could alleviate 
NAFLD-associated pathologies, including body weight, liver/body weight ratio, 
hepatic triglyceride and total cholesterol, and the degree of steatosis. 
Mechanically, we found that the overexpression of CSAD could increase the 
expression of some genes related to fatty acid β-oxidation (Acad1, Ppara, and 
Acox1). Furthermore, we also detected that CSAD could improve mitochondrial 
injury in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we proposed that the effect of CSAD on 
lipid accumulation might be independent of the taurine pathway. In conclusion, 
we demonstrated that CSAD is involved in the development of NAFLD as a 
protective factor, which suggested that CSAD has the potential to become a new 
target for drug discovery in NAFLD."
1345,"CD24 is a mucin-like immunosuppressing glycoprotein whose levels increase during 
pregnancy and decrease in the syncytio- and cytotrophoblasts in early and 
preterm preeclampsia. We used two modified cell lines that mimic in vitro 
features of preeclampsia to identify if this phenomenon could be reproduced. Our 
model was the immortalized placental-derived BeWo and JEG-3 cell lines that 
overexpress the STOX1 A/B transcription factor gene that was discovered in 
familial forms of preeclampsia. BeWo and JEG-3 cells stably transduced with the 
two major isoforms of STOX1-A/B or by an empty vector (control), were 
propagated, harvested, and analyzed. CD24 mRNA expression was determined by 
quantitative real-time polymerase nuclear chain reaction (qRT-PCR). CD24 protein 
levels were determined by Western blots. In STOX1-A/B overexpressing in BeWo 
cells, CD24 mRNA was downregulated by 91 and 85%, respectively, compared to the 
control, and by 30% and 74%, respectively in JEG-3 cells. A 67% and 82% decrease 
in CD24 protein level was determined by immunoblot in BeWo overexpressing 
STOX1-A/B, respectively, while the reduction in JEG-3 cells was between 47 and 
62%. The immortalized BeWo and JEG-3 cell lines overexpressing STOX1-A/B had 
reduced CD24. Although both cell lines were affected, BeWo appears to be more 
susceptible to downregulation by STOX-1 than JEG-3, potentially because of their 
different cell origin and properties. These results strengthen the in vivo 
results of reduced CD24 levels found in early and preterm preeclampsia. 
Accordingly, it implies the importance of the reduced immune tolerance in 
preeclampsia, which was already demonstrated in vivo in the STOX1-A/B model of 
preeclampsia, and is now implied in the in vitro STOX-1 model, a subject that 
warrants further investigations."
1346,"The KNOX genes play important roles in maintaining SAM and regulating the 
development of plant leaves. However, the TaKNOX genes in wheat are still not 
well understood, especially their role in abiotic stress. In this study, a total 
of 36 KNOX genes were identified, and we demonstrated the function of the 
TaKNOX14-D gene under mechanical injury and cold stress. Thirty-six TaKNOX genes 
were divided into two groups, and thirty-four TaKNOX genes were predicted to be 
located in the nucleus by Cell-PLoc. These genes contained five tandem 
duplications. Fifteen collinear gene pairs were exhibited in wheat and rice, one 
collinear gene pair was exhibited in wheat and Arabidopsis. The phylogenetic 
tree and motif analysis suggested that the TaKNOX gene appeared before C3 and C4 
diverged. Gene structure showed that the numbers of exons and introns in TaKNOX 
gene are different. Wheat TaKNOX genes showed different expression patterns 
during the wheat growth phase, with seven TaKNOX genes being highly expressed in 
the whole growth period. These seven genes were also highly expressed in most 
tissues, and also responded to most abiotic stress. Eleven TaKNOX genes were 
up-regulated in the tillering node during the leaf regeneration period after 
mechanical damage. When treating the wheat with different hormones, the 
expression patterns of TaKNOX were changed, and results showed that ABA promoted 
TaKNOX expression and seven TaKNOX genes were up-regulated under cytokinin and 
auxin treatment. Overexpression of the TaKNOX14-D gene in Arabidopsis could 
increase the leaf size, plant height and seed size. This gene overexpression in 
Arabidopsis also increased the compensatory growth capacity after mechanical 
damage. Overexpression lines also showed high resistance to cold stress. This 
study provides a better understanding of the TaKNOX genes."
1347,"Several types of haemoglobinopathies are caused by copy number variants (CNVs). 
While diagnosis is often based on haematological and biochemical parameters, a 
definitive diagnosis requires molecular DNA analysis. In some cases, the 
molecular characterisation of large deletions/duplications is challenging and 
inconclusive and often requires the use of specific diagnostic procedures, such 
as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Herein, we collected 
and comprehensively analysed all known CNVs associated with haemoglobinopathies. 
The dataset of 291 CNVs was retrieved from the IthaGenes database and was 
further manually annotated to specify genomic locations, breakpoints and MLPA 
probes relevant for each CNV. We developed IthaCNVs, a publicly available and 
easy-to-use online tool that can facilitate the diagnosis of rare and 
diagnostically challenging haemoglobinopathy cases attributed to CNVs. 
Importantly, it facilitates the filtering of available entries based on the type 
of breakpoint information, on specific chromosomal and locus positions, on MLPA 
probes, and on affected gene(s). IthaCNVs brings together manually curated 
information about CNV genomic locations, functional effects, and information 
that can facilitate CNV characterisation through MLPA. It can help laboratory 
staff and clinicians confirm suspected diagnosis of CNVs based on molecular DNA 
screening and analysis."
1348,"Prolactin (PRL) is an important hormone that is secreted by the pituitary gland 
and plays an important role in the growth, development and reproduction of 
organisms. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a common prolactin-releasing 
factor that regulates the synthesis and secretion of prolactin. In recent 
studies, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to play a key role in the regulation 
of pituitary hormones. However, there is a lack of systematic studies on the 
regulatory role that TRH plays on the pituitary transcriptome, and the role of 
miRNAs in the regulation of PRL synthesis and secretion by TRH lacks 
experimental evidence. In this study, we first investigated the changes in PRL 
synthesis and secretion in the rat pituitary gland after TRH administration. The 
results of transcriptomic analysis after TRH treatment showed that 102 genes, 
including those that encode Nppc, Fgf1, PRL, Cd63, Npw, and Il23a, were 
upregulated, and 488 genes, including those that encode Lats1, Cacna2d1, Top2a, 
and Tfap2a, were downregulated. These genes are all involved in the regulation 
of prolactin expression. The gene expression of miR-126a-5p, which regulates the 
level of PRL in the pituitary gland, was screened by analysis prediction 
software and by a dual luciferase reporter system. The data presented in this 
study demonstrate that TRH can regulate prolactin synthesis and secretion 
through miR-126a-5p, thereby improving our understanding of the molecular 
mechanism of TRH-mediated PRL secretion and providing a theoretical basis for 
the role of miRNAs in regulating the secretion of pituitary hormones."
1349,"Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, and its 
incidence and death rates have been consistently high throughout the past 
decades. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently gained significant attention because 
of their role in the regulation of a variety of biological processes via 
post-transcriptional silencing mechanisms. Previously, we determined a specific 
profile of miRNAs associated with HNC using a miRNA microarray analysis. Of the 
23 miRNAs with highly altered expression in HNC cells, miR-503 was the most 
significantly downregulated miRNA. In this study, we confirmed that miR-503 acts 
as a tumor suppressor, as our results showed decreased levels of miR-503 in 
cancer cells and patients with HNC. We further characterized the role of miR-503 
in the malignant functions of HNC. Although there was a minimal effect on cell 
growth, miR-503 was found to inhibit cellular invasion significantly. 
Algorithm-based studies identified multiple potential target genes and pathways 
associated with oncogenic mechanisms. The candidate target gene, WNT3A, was 
confirmed to be downregulated by miR-503 at both the mRNA and protein levels and 
validated by a reporter assay. Furthermore, miR-503 modulated multiple 
invasion-associated genes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), through 
the Wnt downstream signaling pathway. Overall, this study demonstrates that 
miR-503 suppresses HNC malignancy by inhibiting cell invasion through the Wnt 
signaling pathway via the WNT3A/MMP molecular axis. The modulation of miR-503 
may be a novel therapeutic approach to intervene in cancer invasion."
1350,"Plants are affected by changes in light and adaptation mechanisms can affect 
secondary metabolite synthesis. In this study, the physiological response and 
regulation of the coumarin biosynthetic pathway of Angelica dahurica to 
different light intensities (natural light (CK), shade rate 50% (L1), shade rate 
70% (L2), and shade rate 90% (L3)) were examined. The chlorophyll content, level 
of the enzymes of the antioxidant system, extent of lipid peroxidation, and 
concentrations of the osmoregulatory solute levels were determined in potted 
plants. Root transcriptome under different light intensities was sequenced using 
high-throughput technology, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to 
coumarin biosynthesis were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). 
With increasing shade, Chl a, Chl b, Chl a + b, and Chl a/b content increased, 
while the Chl a/b ratio decreased. The antioxidant enzyme system activity and 
extent of membrane lipid peroxidation increased. The soluble protein (SP) and 
proline (Pro) content decreased with the reduction in the light intensity, and 
soluble sugar (SS) content was found to be highest at 50% shade. The RNA-seq 
analysis showed that 9388 genes were differentially expressed in the L3 group 
(7561 were upregulated and 1827 were downregulated). In both the L1 and L2 
groups, DEGs were significantly enriched in ""Ribosome biosynthesis""; meanwhile, 
in the L3 group, the DEGs were significantly enriched in ""Amino and 
ribonucleotide sugar metabolism"" in KEGG metabolic pathway analysis. 
Additionally, 4CL (TRINITY_DN40230_c0_g2) and COMT (TRINITY_DN21272_c0_g1) of 
the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway were significantly downregulated in the L3 
group. In conclusion, A. dahurica grew best under 50% shade and the 
secondary-metabolite coumarin biosynthetic pathway was inhibited by 90% shade, 
affecting the yield and quality of medicinal compounds."
1351,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by its high vascularity and 
metastasis. Thymoquinone (TQ), the main bio-active constituent of Nigella 
sativa, has shown anticancer and hepatoprotective effects. TQ's anticancer 
effect is mediated through miRNA regulation. miR-1-3p plays a significant role 
in various cancers but its role in HCC invasiveness remains poorly understood. 
Bio-informatics analysis predicted that the 3'-UTR of TIMP3 is a target for 
miR-1-3p; Rats were equally divided into four groups: Group 1, the negative 
control; Group 2 received TQ; Group 3 received DEN; and Group 4 received DEN 
after pretreatment with TQ. The expression of TIMP3, MMP2, MMP9, and VEGF in 
rats' liver was determined immunohistochemically. RT-qPCR was used to measure 
the miR-1-3p level in rats' liver, and TIMP3, MMP2, MMP9, and VEGF in the HepG2 
cells after being transfected with miR-1-3p mimic or inhibitor; In rats 
pretreated with TQ, a decreased expression of MMP2, MMP9 and VEGF, and increased 
expression levels of TIMP3 and miR-1-3p were detected. Treating the HepG2 cells 
with miR-1-3p mimic led to the upregulation of TIMP3 and downregulation of MMP2, 
MMP9, and VEGF, and showed a significant delay in wound healing; These results 
suggested that the anti-angiogenic effect of TQ in HCC may be mediated through 
the regulation of miR-1-3p."
1352,"Mutations in the human desmin gene (DES) may cause both autosomal dominant and 
recessive cardiomyopathies leading to heart failure, arrhythmias and 
atrio-ventricular blocks, or progressive myopathies. Cardiac conduction 
disorders, arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies usually associated with progressive 
myopathy are the main manifestations of autosomal dominant desminopathies, due 
to mono-allelic pathogenic variants. The recessive forms, due to bi-allelic 
variants, are very rare and exhibit variable phenotypes in which premature 
sudden cardiac death could also occur in the first or second decade of life. We 
describe a further case of autosomal recessive desminopathy in an Italian boy 
born of consanguineous parents, who developed progressive myopathy at age 12, 
and dilated cardiomyopathy four years later and died of intractable heart 
failure at age 17. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis identified the 
homozygous loss-of-function variant c.634C&gt;T; p.Arg212*, which was likely 
inherited from both parents. Furthermore, we performed a comparison of clinical 
and genetic results observed in our patient with those of cases so far reported 
in the literature."
1353,"An effective treatment and possible cure for type 1 diabetes is transplantation 
of pancreatic islets. Unfortunately, transplanted islets are rejected by the 
immune system with humoral-mediated responses being an important part of 
rejection. Sertoli cells (SC), an immune regulatory cell shown to survive as 
allografts long-term without immunosuppressants, have the potential to be used 
as a cell-based gene therapy vehicle to deliver endogenous insulin-a possible 
alternative to islets. Previously, we transduced a mouse SC line to produce 
human insulin. After transplantation into diabetic mice, these cells 
consistently produced low levels of insulin with graft survival of 75% at 50 
days post-transplantation. The object of this study was to assess humoral immune 
regulation by these engineered SC. Both nontransduced and transduced SC survived 
exposure to human serum with complement in vitro. Analysis of allografts in vivo 
at 20 and 50 days post-transplantation revealed that despite IgG antibody 
detection, complement factor deposition was low and grafts survived through 50 
days post-transplantation. Furthermore, the transduced SC secreted elevated 
levels of the complement inhibitor C1q binding protein. Overall, this suggests 
SC genetically engineered to express insulin maintain their ability to prevent 
complement-mediated killing. Since inhibiting complement-mediated rejection is 
important for graft survival, further studies of how SC modifies the immune 
response could be utilized to advance the use of genetically engineered SC or to 
prolong islet allograft survival to improve the treatment of diabetes."
1354,"Muscle loss and weakness after a burn injury are typically the consequences of 
neuronal dysregulation and metabolic change. Hypermetabolism has been noted to 
cause muscle atrophy. However, the mechanism underlying the development of 
burn-induced motor neuropathy and its contribution to muscle atrophy warrant 
elucidation. Current therapeutic interventions for burn-induced motor neuropathy 
demonstrate moderate efficacy and have side effects, which limit their usage. We 
previously used a third-degree burn injury rodent model and found that irisin-an 
exercise-induced myokine-exerts a protective effect against burn injury-induced 
sensory and motor neuropathy by attenuating neuronal damage in the spinal cord. 
In the current study, spinal irisin gene delivery was noted to attenuate burn 
injury-induced sciatic nerve demyelination and reduction of neuromuscular 
junction innervation. Spinal overexpression of irisin leads to myelination 
rehabilitation and muscular innervation through the modulation of brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor and glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor expression 
along the sciatic nerve to the muscle tissues and thereby modulates the Akt/mTOR 
pathway and metabolic derangement and prevents muscle atrophy."
1355,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a group of plant steroid hormones that play important 
roles in a wide range of developmental and physiological processes in plants. 
Transcription factors BRASSINOZALE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1) and its homologs are key 
components of BR signaling and integrate a wide range of internal and 
environmental signals to coordinate plant growth and development. Although 
several E3 ligases have been reported to regulate the stability of BZR1, the 
molecular mechanism of BZR1 degradation remains unclear. Here, we reveal how a 
newly identified molecular mechanism underlying EBF1 directly regulates BZR1 
protein stability via the 26S proteasome pathway, repressing BR function on 
regulating Arabidopsis apical hook development and hypocotyl elongation. BZR1 
directly binds to the EBF1 gene promotor to reduce EBF1 expression. Furthermore, 
the genetic analysis shows that BZR1, EIN3 and PIF4 interdependently regulate 
plant apical hook development. Taken together, our data demonstrates that EBF1 
is a negative regulator of the BR signaling pathway."
1356,"Senescence is a programmed process that involves the destruction of the 
photosynthesis apparatus and the relocation of nutrients to the grain. 
Identifying senescence-associated genes is essential to adapting varieties for 
the duration of the cultivation cycle. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
was performed using 400 inbred maize lines with 156,164 SNPs to study the 
genetic architecture of senescence-related traits and their relationship with 
agronomic traits. We estimated the timing of senescence to be 45 days after 
anthesis in the whole plant and specifically in the husks. A list of genes 
identified in a previous RNAseq experiment as involved in senescence (core 
senescence genes) was used to propose candidate genes in the vicinity of the 
significant SNPs. Forty-six QTLs of moderate to high effect were found for 
senescence traits, including specific QTLs for husk senescence. The allele that 
delayed senescence primarily increased grain yield and moisture. Seven and one 
significant SNPs were found in the coding and promoter regions of eight core 
senescence genes, respectively. These genes could be potential candidates for 
generating a new variation by genome editing for functional analysis and 
breeding purposes, particularly Zm00001d014796, which could be responsible for a 
QTL of senescence found in multiple studies."
1357,"Salt stress severely affects crop growth and development and reduces the yield 
of Brassica napus. Exploring natural genetic variations for high salt tolerance 
in B. napus seedlings is an effective approach to improve productivity under 
salt stress. Using 10,658 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) 
markers developed by specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) 
technology, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed to investigate 
the genetic basis of salt tolerance and yield-related traits of B. napus. The 
results revealed that 77 and 497 SNPs were significantly associated with salt 
tolerance and yield-related traits, of which 40 and 58 SNPs were located in 
previously reported QTLs/SNPs, respectively. We identified nineteen candidate 
genes orthologous with Arabidopsis genes known to be associated with salt 
tolerance and seven potential candidates controlling both salt tolerance and 
yield. Our study provides a novel genetic resource for the breeding of 
high-yield cultivars resistant to salt stress."
1358,"Cellular functions depend on the dynamic assembly of protein regulator complexes 
at specific cellular locations. Single Molecule Tracking (SMT) is a method of 
choice for the biochemical characterization of protein dynamics in vitro and in 
vivo. SMT follows individual molecules in live cells and provides direct 
information about their behavior. SMT was successfully applied to mammalian 
models. However, mammalian cells provide a complex environment where protein 
mobility depends on numerous factors that are difficult to control 
experimentally. Therefore, yeast cells, which are unicellular and well-studied 
with a small and completely sequenced genome, provide an attractive alternative 
for SMT. The simplicity of organization, ease of genetic manipulation, and 
tolerance to gene fusions all make yeast a great model for quantifying the 
kinetics of major enzymes, membrane proteins, and nuclear and cellular bodies. 
However, very few researchers apply SMT techniques to yeast. Our goal is to 
promote SMT in yeast to a wider research community. Our review serves a dual 
purpose. We explain how SMT is conducted in yeast cells, and we discuss the 
latest insights from yeast SMT while putting them in perspective with SMT of 
higher eukaryotes."
1359,"Ferroptosis is a regulated cell death process characterised by the 
iron-dependent accumulation of oxidised polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing 
phospholipids. Its initiation is complicated and involves reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) and a loss of the activity of the lipid repair enzyme glutathione 
peroxidase 4 (GPX4). These play critical roles in the development of ferroptotic 
cell damage by lipid peroxidation. Antioxidant therapy is a promising 
therapeutic strategy to prevent or even reverse the progression of ferroptosis. 
This study was designed to demonstrate the protective effect of ferulic acid 
(FA) against oxidative stress and erastin-mediated ferroptosis in murine MIN6 
cells. Cells were treated with FA or its metabolite ferulic acid 4-O-sulfate 
disodium salt (FAS) and 20 μM of erastin. Cell viability was determined by 
3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, iron 
levels were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), 
ROS levels were determined by a dihydrodichlorofluorescein (H2DCF) cell-permeant 
probe, and glutathione and lipid peroxidation were assayed with commercially 
available kits. The phenolic acids enhanced cell viability in erastin-treated 
MIN6 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, MIN6 cells exposed to 
erastin alone showed elevated levels of iron and ROS, glutathione (GSH) 
depletion, and lipid peroxidation (p &lt; 0.05) compared to cells that were 
protected by co-treatment with FA or FAS. The treatment of MIN6 cells with FA or 
FAS following exposure to erastin increased the nuclear translocation of nuclear 
factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein levels. Consequently, levels 
of its downstream antioxidant proteins, HO-1, NQO1, GCLC, and GPX4, increased. 
FA and FAS greatly decreased erastin-induced ferroptosis in the presence of the 
Nrf2 inhibitor, ML385, through the regulation of Nrf2 response genes. In 
conclusion, these results show that FA and FAS protect MIN6 cells from 
erastin-induced ferroptosis by the Nrf2 antioxidant protective mechanism."
1360,"Chronic gut inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD) is associated with an increase 
in oxidative stress and an imbalance of antioxidant enzymes. We have previously 
shown that catalase (CAT) activity is permanently inhibited by CD. The purpose 
of the study was to determine whether there is any relationship between the 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CAT enzyme and the potential risk 
of CD associated with high levels of oxidative stress. Additionally, we used 
protein and regulation analyses to determine what causes long-term CAT 
inhibition in peripheral white mononuclear cells (PWMCs) in both active and 
inactive CD. We first used a retrospective cohort of 598 patients with CD and 
625 age-matched healthy controls (ENEIDA registry) for the genotype analysis. A 
second human cohort was used to study the functional and regulatory mechanisms 
of CAT in CD. We isolated PWMCs from CD patients at the onset of the disease 
(naïve CD patients). In the genotype-association SNP analysis, the CAT SNPs 
rs1001179, rs475043, and rs525938 showed a significant association with CD (p 
&lt; 0.001). Smoking CD patients with the CAT SNP rs475043 A/G genotype had 
significantly more often penetrating disease (p = 0.009). The gene expression 
and protein levels of CAT were permanently reduced in the active and inactive CD 
patients. The inhibition of CAT activity in the PWMCs of the CD patients was 
related to a low concentration of CAT protein caused by the downregulation of 
CAT-gene transcription. Our study suggests an association between CAT SNPs and 
the risk of CD that may explain permanent CAT inhibition in CD patients together 
with low CAT gene and protein expression."
1361,"The persistence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as the principal 
complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) demonstrates 
that HLA matching alone is insufficient to prevent alloreactivity. We performed 
molecular and functional characterization of 22 candidate cytokine genes for 
their potential to improve matching in 315 myeloablative, 10/10 HLA-matched 
donor-recipient pairs. Recipients of a graft carrying the -1082GG IL10 gene 
promoter region variant had a three-fold lower incidence of grade II-IV acute 
GVHD compared to IL10-1082AA graft recipients (SHR = 0.25, p = 0.005). This was 
most evident in matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplants, where the greatest 
alloreactivity is expected. IL10-1082GG transplants did not experience an 
increased incidence of relapse, and, consequently, overall survival was two-fold 
higher in IL10-1082GG MUD transplants (HR = 0.17, p = 0.023). Longitudinal 
post-transplant measurements demonstrated that -1082GG is a high-IL10-producing 
and -expressing genotype with attenuated CD8+ T-cell reconstitution. High 
post-transplant donor chimerism in T- and myeloid-cells (&gt;95%) confirmed a 
predominant donor, rather than recipient, genotype effect on immune function and 
aGVHD. To date, this is the first study to report corroborating 
genome-to-cellular evidence for a non-HLA donor immunogenetic variant that 
appears to be protective against GVHD. The incorporation of IL10 variants in 
donor selection criteria and clinical-management decisions has the potential to 
improve patient outcomes."
1362,"Metal transporters play crucial roles in plant nutrition, development, and metal 
homeostasis. To date, several multi-proteins have been identified for metal 
transport across the plasma membrane and tonoplast. Nevertheless, Golgi 
endomembrane metal carriers and their mechanisms are less documented. In this 
study, we identified a new transmembrane nine (TMN) family gene, TMN11, which 
encodes a Mn transport protein that was localized to the cis-Golgi endomembrane 
in rice. OsTMN11 contains a typically conserved long luminal N-terminal domain 
and nine transmembrane domains. OsTMN11 was ubiquitously expressed over the 
lifespan of rice and strongly upregulated in young rice under excess 
Mn(II)/Cd(II) stress. Ectopic expression of OsTMN11 in an Mn-sensitive pmr1 
mutant (PMR1 is a Golgi-resident Mn exporter) yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) 
restored the defective phenotype and transported excess Mn out of the cells. As 
ScPMR1 mediates cellular Mn efflux via a vesicle-secretory pathway, the results 
suggest that OsTMN11 functions in a similar manner. OsTMN11 knockdown (by RNAi) 
compromised the growth of young rice, manifested as shorter plant height, 
reduced biomass, and chlorosis under excessive Mn and Cd conditions. Two 
lifelong field trials with rice cropped in either normal Mn supply conditions or 
in Cd-contaminated farmland demonstrated that knockdown of OsTMN11 impaired the 
capacity of seed development (including panicle, spikelet fertility, seed 
length, grain weight, etc.). The mature RNAi plants contained less Mn but 
accumulated Cd in grains and rice straw, confirming that OsTMN11 plays a 
fundamental role in metal homeostasis associated with rice growth and 
development even under normal Mn supply conditions."
1363,"Most glioblastoma studies incorporate the layer of tumor molecular subtype based 
on the four-subtype classification system proposed in 2010. Nevertheless, there 
is no universally recognized and convenient tool for glioblastoma molecular 
subtyping, and each study applies a different set of markers and/or approaches 
that cause inconsistencies in data comparability and reproducibility between 
studies. Thus, this study aimed to create an applicable user-friendly tool for 
glioblastoma classification, with high accuracy, while using a significantly 
smaller number of variables. The study incorporated a TCGA microarray, 
sequencing datasets, and an independent cohort of 56 glioblastomas (LUHS 
cohort). The models were constructed by applying the Agilent G4502 dataset, and 
they were tested using the Affymetrix HG-U133a and Illumina Hiseq cohorts, as 
well as the LUHS cases. Two classification models were constructed by applying a 
logistic regression classification algorithm, based on the mRNA levels of twenty 
selected genes. The classifiers were translated to a RT-qPCR assay and validated 
in an independent cohort of 56 glioblastomas. The classification accuracy of the 
20-gene and 5-gene classifiers varied between 90.7-91% and 85.9-87.7%, 
respectively. With this work, we propose a cost-efficient three-class 
(classical, mesenchymal, and proneural) tool for glioblastoma molecular 
classification based on the mRNA analysis of only 5-20 genes, and we provide the 
basic information for classification performance starting from the wet-lab 
stage. We hope that the proposed classification tool will enable data 
comparability between different research groups."
1364,"GEP-NETs are heterogeneous tumors originating from the pancreas (panNET) or the 
intestinal tract. Only a few patients with NETs are amenable to curative tumor 
resection, and for most patients, only palliative treatments to successfully 
control the disease or manage symptoms remain, such as with synthetic 
somatostatin (SST) analogs (SSAs), such as octreotide (OCT) or lanreotide (LAN). 
However, even cells expressing low levels of SST receptors (SSTRs) may exhibit 
significant responses to OCT, which suggests the possibility that SSAs signal 
through alternative mechanisms, e.g., transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. This 
signaling mode has been demonstrated in the established panNET line BON but not 
yet in other permanent (i.e., QGP) or primary (i.e., NT-3) panNET-derived cells. 
Here, we performed qPCR, immunoblot analyses, and cell counting assays to assess 
the effects of SST, OCT, LAN, and TGF-β1 on neuroendocrine marker expression and 
cell proliferation in NT-3, QGP, and BON cells. SST and SSAs were found to 
regulate a set of neuroendocrine genes in all three cell lines, with the effects 
of SST, mainly LAN, often differing from those of OCT. However, unlike NT-3 
cells, BON cells failed to respond to OCT with growth arrest but paradoxically 
exhibited a growth-stimulatory effect after treatment with LAN. As previously 
shown for BON, NT-3 cells responded to TGF-β1 treatment with induction of 
expression of SST and SSTR2/5. Of note, the ability of NT-3 cells to respond to 
TGF-β1 with upregulation of the established TGF-β target gene SERPINE1 depended 
on cellular adherence to a collagen-coated matrix. Moreover, when applied to 
NT-3 cells for an extended period, i.e., 14 days, TGF-β1 induced growth 
suppression as shown earlier for BON cells. Finally, next-generation 
sequencing-based identification of microRNAs (miRNAs) in BON and NT-3 revealed 
that SST and OCT impact positively or negatively on the regulation of specific 
miRNAs. Our results suggest that primary panNET cells, such as NT-3, respond 
similarly as BON cells to SST, SSA, and TGF-β treatment and thus provide 
circumstantial evidence that crosstalk of SST and TGF-β signaling is not 
confined to BON cells but is a general feature of panNETs."
1365,"Genetic discoveries related to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias have been 
performed using either large cohorts of affected subjects or multiple 
individuals from the same pedigree, therefore disregarding mutations in the 
context of healthy groups. Moreover, a large portion of studies so far have been 
performed on individuals of European ancestry, with a remarkable lack of 
epidemiological and genomic data from underrepresented populations. In the 
present study, 70 single-point mutations on the APP gene in a publicly available 
genetic dataset that included 2504 healthy individuals from 26 populations were 
scanned, and their distribution was analyzed. Furthermore, after gametic phase 
reconstruction, a pairwise comparison of the segments surrounding the mutations 
was performed to reveal patterns of haplotype sharing that could point to 
specific cross-population and cross-ancestry admixture events. Eight mutations 
were detected in the worldwide dataset, with several of them being specific for 
a single individual, population, or macroarea. Patterns of segment sharing 
reflected recent historical events of migration and admixture possibly linked to 
colonization campaigns. These observations reveal the population dynamics of the 
considered APP mutations in worldwide human groups and support the development 
of ancestry-informed screening practices for the improvement of precision and 
personalized approaches to neurodegeneration and dementia."
1366,"CRISPR-Cas allows us to introduce desired genome editing, including mutations, 
epitopes, and deletions, with unprecedented efficiency. The development of 
CRISPR-Cas has progressed to such an extent that it is now applicable in various 
fields, with the help of model organisms. C. elegans is one of the pioneering 
animals in which numerous CRISPR-Cas strategies have been rapidly established 
over the past decade. Ironically, the emergence of numerous methods makes the 
choice of the correct method difficult. Choosing an appropriate selection or 
screening approach is the first step in planning a genome modification. This 
report summarizes the key features and applications of CRISPR-Cas methods using 
C. elegans, illustrating key strategies. Our overview of significant advances in 
CRISPR-Cas will help readers understand the current advances in genome editing 
and navigate various methods of CRISPR-Cas genome editing."
1367,"The current investigation assessed the effect of the eudesmanolid, Vulgarin 
(VGN), obtained from Artemisia judaica (A. judaica), on the antidiabetic 
potential of glibenclamide (GLB) using streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes. 
Seven groups of rats were used in the study; the first group received the 
vehicle and served as normal control. The diabetic rats of the second to the 
fifth groups were treated with the vehicle (negative control), GLB at 5 mg/kg 
(positive control), VGN at 10 mg/kg (VGN-10) and VGN at 20 mg/kg (VGN-20), 
respectively. The diabetic rats of the sixth and seventh groups were 
administered combinations of GLB plus VGN-10 and GLB plus VGN-20, respectively. 
The diabetic rats treated with GLB plus VGN-20 combination showed marked 
improvement in the fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin and glycated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c), as well as the lipid profile, compared with those treated with GLB 
alone. Further, the pancreatic tissues of the diabetic rats that received the 
GLB+VGN-20 combination showed superior improvements in lipid peroxidation and 
antioxidant parameters than those of GLB monotherapy. The insulin content of the 
β-cells was restored in all treatments, while the levels of glucagon and 
somatostatin of the α- and δ-endocrine cells were reduced in the pancreatic 
islets. In addition, the concurrent administration of GLB+VGN-20 was the most 
effective in restoring PEPCK and G6Pase mRNA expression in the liver. In 
conclusion, the results demonstrated that the GLB+VGN-20 combination led to 
greater glycemic improvement in diabetic rats compared with GLB monotherapy 
through its antioxidant effect and capability to modulate PEPCK and G6Pase gene 
expression in their livers."
1368,"Long-read sequencing (LRS) has been adopted to meet a wide variety of research 
needs, ranging from the construction of novel transcriptome annotations to the 
rapid identification of emerging virus variants. Amongst other advantages, LRS 
preserves more information about RNA at the transcript level than conventional 
high-throughput sequencing, including far more accurate and quantitative records 
of splicing patterns. New studies with LRS datasets are being published at an 
exponential rate, generating a vast reservoir of information that can be 
leveraged to address a host of different research questions. However, mining 
such publicly available data in a tailored fashion is currently not easy, as the 
available software tools typically require familiarity with the command-line 
interface, which constitutes a significant obstacle to many researchers. 
Additionally, different research groups utilize different software packages to 
perform LRS analysis, which often prevents a direct comparison of published 
results across different studies. To address these challenges, we have developed 
the Long-Read Analysis Pipeline for Transcriptomics (L-RAPiT), a user-friendly, 
free pipeline requiring no dedicated computational resources or bioinformatics 
expertise. L-RAPiT can be implemented directly through Google Colaboratory, a 
system based on the open-source Jupyter notebook environment, and allows for the 
direct analysis of transcriptomic reads from Oxford Nanopore and PacBio LRS 
machines. This new pipeline enables the rapid, convenient, and standardized 
analysis of publicly available or newly generated LRS datasets."
1369,"Sugar Will Eventually be Exported Transporter (SWEET) proteins are key 
transporters in sugar transportation. They are involved in the regulation of 
plant growth and development, hormone crosstalk, and biotic and abiotic stress 
responses. However, SWEET family genes have not been explored in the sweet 
potato. In this study, we identified 27, 27, and 25 SWEETs in cultivated 
hexaploid sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas, 2n = 6x = 90) and its two diploid 
relatives, Ipomoea trifida (2n = 2x = 30) and Ipomoea triloba (2n = 2x = 30), 
respectively. These SWEETs were divided into four subgroups according to their 
phylogenetic relationships with Arabidopsis. The protein physiological 
properties, chromosome localization, phylogenetic relationships, gene 
structures, promoter cis-elements, protein interaction networks, and expression 
patterns of these 79 SWEETs were systematically investigated. The results 
suggested that homologous SWEETs are differentiated in sweet potato and its two 
diploid relatives and play various vital roles in plant growth, tuberous root 
development, carotenoid accumulation, hormone crosstalk, and abiotic stress 
response. This work provides a comprehensive comparison and furthers our 
understanding of the SWEET genes in the sweet potato and its two diploid 
relatives, thereby supplying a theoretical foundation for their functional study 
and further facilitating the molecular breeding of sweet potato."
1370,"The work focused on the analysis of two cultivars of tomato (Solanum 
lycopersicum L.), Aragon and Gladis, under two different treatments of silicon, 
Low, 2 L of 0.1 mM CaSiO3, and High, 0.5 mM CaSiO3, weekly, for 8 weeks, under 
stress-free conditions. We subsequently analyzed the morphology, chemical 
composition, and elemental distribution using synchrotron-based µ-XRF 
techniques, physiological, and molecular aspects of the response of the two 
cultivars. The scope of the study was to highlight any significant response of 
the plants to the Si treatments, in comparison with any response to Si of plants 
under stress. The results demonstrated that the response was mainly 
cultivar-dependent, also at the level of mitochondrial-dependent oxidative 
stress, and that it did not differ from the two conditions of treatments. With 
Si deposited mainly in the cell walls of the cells of fruits, leaves, and roots, 
the treatments did not elicit many significant changes from the point of view of 
the total elemental content, the physiological parameters that measured the 
oxidative stress, and the transcriptomic analyses focalized on genes related to 
the response to Si. We observed a priming effect of the treatment on the most 
responsive cultivar, Aragon, in respect to future stress, while in Gladis the Si 
treatment did not significantly change the measured parameters."
1371,"Increasing evidence suggests that both coding and non-coding regions of 
sarcomeric protein genes can contribute to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). 
Here, we introduce an experimental workflow (tested on four patients) for 
complete sequencing of the most common HCM genes (MYBPC3, MYH7, TPM1, TNNT2, and 
TNNI3) via long-range PCR, Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing, and 
bioinformatic analysis. We applied Illumina and Sanger sequencing to validate 
the results, FastQC, Qualimap, and MultiQC for quality evaluations, MiniMap2 to 
align data, Clair3 to call and phase variants, and Annovar's tools and CADD to 
assess pathogenicity of variants. We could not amplify the region encompassing 
exons 6-12 of MYBPC3. A higher sequencing error rate was observed with ONT 
(6.86-6.92%) than with Illumina technology (1.14-1.35%), mostly for small 
indels. Pathogenic variant p.Gln1233Ter and benign polymorphism p.Arg326Gln in 
MYBPC3 in a heterozygous state were found in one patient. We demonstrated the 
ability of ONT to phase single-nucleotide variants, enabling direct haplotype 
determination for genes TNNT2 and TPM1. These findings highlight the importance 
of long-range PCR efficiency, as well as lower accuracy of variant calling by 
ONT than by Illumina technology; these differences should be clarified prior to 
clinical application of the ONT method."
1372,"p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers. Two fundamental reasons 
for this are its long protein isoforms protect from cancer, while its shorter 
C-terminal isoforms can support cancer and metastasis. Previously, we have shown 
that the Δ160p53 protein isoform enhances survival and the invasive character of 
cancer cells. Here, we identified a translation initiation site nine codons 
downstream of codon 160-the known initiation codon for the translation of 
Δ160p53-that is recognized by the translation machinery. When translation failed 
to initiate from AUG160 due to mutation, it initiated from AUG169 instead, 
producing similar levels of a similar protein, Δ169p53, which promoted cell 
survival as efficiently as Δ160p53 following DNA damage. Interestingly, almost 
all mammalian species with an orthologue to human AUG160 also possess one for 
AUG169, while none of the non-mammalian species lacking AUG160 have AUG169, even 
if that region of the p53 gene is well conserved. In view of our findings, we do 
not believe that Δ169p53 acts as a different p53 protein isoform; instead, we 
propose that the double translation initiation site strengthens the translation 
of these products with a critical role in cell homeostasis. Future studies will 
help verify if this is a more general mechanism for the expression of essential 
proteins in mammals."
1373,"In China, the Cranoglanis bouderius is classified as a national class 
II-protected animal. The development of C. bouderius populations has been 
affected by a variety of factors over the past few decades, with severe declines 
occurring. Considering the likelihood of continued population declines of the C. 
bouderius in the future, it is critical to investigate the currently unknown 
characteristics of gonadal differentiation and sex-related genes for C. 
bouderius conservation. In this study, the Illumina sequencing platform was used 
to sequence the gonadal transcriptome of the C. bouderius to identify the 
pathways and genes related to gonadal development and analyze the expression 
differences in the gonads. A total of 12,002 DEGs were identified, with 7220 
being significantly expressed in the ovary and 4782 being significantly 
expressed in the testis. According to the functional enrichment results, the 
cell cycle, RNA transport, apoptosis, Wnt signaling pathway, p53 signaling 
pathway, and prolactin signaling pathway play important roles in sex development 
in the C. bouderius. Furthermore, the sequence characterization and evolutionary 
analysis revealed that AMH, DAX1, NANOS1, and AR of the C. bouderius are highly 
conserved. Specifically, the qRT-PCR results from various tissues showed 
significant differences in AMH, DAX1, NANOS1, and AR expression levels in the 
gonads of both sexes of C. bouderius. These analyses indicated that AMH, DAX1, 
NANOS1, and AR may play important roles in the differentiation and development 
of C. bouderius gonads. To our best knowledge, this study is the first to 
analyze the C. bouderius gonadal transcriptome and identify the structures of 
sex-related genes, laying the foundation for future research."
1374,"Invasive insects cost the global economy around USD 70 billion per year. 
Moreover, increasing agricultural insect pests raise concerns about global food 
security constraining and infestation rising after climate changes. Current 
agricultural pest management largely relies on plant breeding-with or without 
transgenes-and chemical pesticides. Both approaches face serious technological 
obsolescence in the field due to plant resistance breakdown or development of 
insecticide resistance. The need for new modes of action (MoA) for managing crop 
health is growing each year, driven by market demands to reduce economic losses 
and by consumer demand for phytosanitary measures. The disabling of pest genes 
through sequence-specific expression silencing is a promising tool in the 
development of environmentally-friendly and safe biopesticides. The specificity 
conferred by long dsRNA-base solutions helps minimize effects on off-target 
genes in the insect pest genome and the target gene in non-target organisms 
(NTOs). In this review, we summarize the status of gene silencing by RNA 
interference (RNAi) for agricultural control. More specifically, we focus on the 
engineering, development and application of gene silencing to control 
Lepidoptera through non-transforming dsRNA technologies. Despite some delivery 
and stability drawbacks of topical applications, we reviewed works showing 
convincing proof-of-concept results that point to innovative solutions. 
Considerations about the regulation of the ongoing research on dsRNA-based 
pesticides to produce commercialized products for exogenous application are 
discussed. Academic and industry initiatives have revealed a worthy effort to 
control Lepidoptera pests with this new mode of action, which provides more 
sustainable and reliable technologies for field management. New data on the 
genomics of this taxon may contribute to a future customized target gene 
portfolio. As a case study, we illustrate how dsRNA and associated methodologies 
could be applied to control an important lepidopteran coffee pest."
1375,"Cellular metabolism governs the signaling that supports physiological mechanisms 
and homeostasis in an individual, including neuronal transmission, wound 
healing, and circadian clock manipulation. Various factors have been linked to 
abnormal metabolic reprogramming, including gene mutations, epigenetic 
modifications, altered protein epitopes, and their involvement in the 
development of disease, including cancer. The presence of multiple distinct 
hallmarks and the resulting cellular reprogramming process have gradually 
revealed that these metabolism-related molecules may be able to be used to track 
or prevent the progression of cancer. Consequently, translational medicines have 
been developed using metabolic substrates, precursors, and other products 
depending on their biochemical mechanism of action. It is important to note that 
these metabolic analogs can also be used for imaging and therapeutic purposes in 
addition to competing for metabolic functions. In particular, due to their 
isotopic labeling, these compounds may also be used to localize and visualize 
tumor cells after uptake. In this review, the current development status, 
applicability, and limitations of compounds targeting metabolic reprogramming 
are described, as well as the imaging platforms that are most suitable for each 
compound and the types of cancer to which they are most appropriate."
1376,"Successful conception requires the synchrony of multiple systems and organs. 
Dysregulation of stromal cell-immune cell interactions has been proposed to be 
associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion. However, the mechanism of this 
regulation has not been well elucidated. N6-methyladenosine is one of the most 
common RNA modifications, and is involved in many pathological processes. Our 
group has demonstrated that abnormal patterns of m6A modification inhibit 
trophoblast invasion and contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. The 
association between m6A regulators and stromal cell-immune cell interactions is 
unclear. We obtained RNA-seq profiles from a GEO dataset and identified 
differentially expressed m6A regulators between healthy controls and patients 
with a recurrent spontaneous abortion history. ROC curves, functional enrichment 
and subclassification analysis were applied to elucidate the role of m6A 
regulators in pregnancy. We verified the expression of m6A regulators and 
constructed an overexpression cell line in a coculture system to reveal ALKBH5 
function in stromal cell-macrophage interactions. We identified 11 
differentially expressed m6A regulators between healthy controls and patients 
with a recurrent spontaneous abortion history. Then, we identified the 
correlation between ""eraser"" genes and ""writer"" genes. We tested the predictive 
abilities of the 11 m6A regulators based on another dataset and verified their 
expression in primary human endometrial stromal cells. We then subclassified 
three distinct patterns using the 11 genes and visualized genes related to 
immune infiltration and macrophage function in each cluster. ALKBH5 was proven 
to be correlated with recurrent spontaneous abortion. To verify the role of 
ALKBH5 in RSA, we constructed an ALKBH5-overexpression cell line. Finally, we 
cocultured the overexpression cell line with THP-1 cells. A decrease in M2 
differentiation was observed, and this bias could be attributed to the 
hyposecretion of VEGF in stromal cells. N6-methyladenosine regulators play a 
pivotal role in stromal cell-immune cell interactions at the maternal-fetal 
interface. Overexpression of the m6A ""eraser"" gene ALKBH5 in stromal cells 
resulted in the hyposecretion of VEGF. Dysregulation of VEGF might impair 
macrophage recruitment and M2 differentiation, which could be the potential 
cause of recurrent spontaneous abortion."
1377,"During mouse pregnancy placental lactogens stimulate prolactin receptors on 
pancreatic islet beta cells to induce expression of the tryptophan hydroxylase 
Tph1, resulting in the synthesis and secretion of serotonin. Presently, the 
functional relevance of this phenomenon is unclear. One hypothesis is that 
serotonin-induced activation of 5-HT2B receptors on beta cells stimulates beta 
cell proliferation during pregnancy. We tested this hypothesis via three 
different mouse models: (i) total Tph1KO mice, (ii) 129P2/OlaHsd mice, which are 
incompetent to upregulate islet Tph1 during pregnancy, whereas Tph1 is normally 
expressed in the intestine, mammary glands, and placenta, and (iii) 
Htr2b-deficient mice. We observed normal pregnancy-induced levels of beta cell 
proliferation in total Tph1KO mice, 129P2/OlaHsd mice, and in Htr2b-/- mice. The 
three studied mouse models indicate that islet serotonin production and its 
signaling via 5-HT2B receptors are not required for the wave of beta cell 
proliferation that occurs during normal mouse pregnancy."
1378,"Reactive oxygen species are formed as by-products of normal cell metabolism. 
They are needed to maintain cell homeostasis and signaling, which is possible 
due to defense systems. Disruption of this balance leads to oxidative stress 
that can induce cancer. Redox regulation by miRNAs may be a potential 
therapeutic target. The aim of the study was to assess the activity of genes 
associated with oxidative stress in endometrial cancer and to determine their 
relationship with miRNAs. The study included 45 patients with endometrioid 
endometrial cancer and 45 without neoplastic changes. The expression profile of 
genes associated with oxidative stress was determined with mRNA microarrays, 
RT-qPCR and ELISA. The miRNA prediction was performed based on the miRNA 
microarray experiment and the mirDB tool. PRDX2 and AQP1 showed overexpression 
that was probably not related to miRNA activity. A high level of PKD2 may be the 
result of a decrease in the activity of miR-195-3p, miR-20a, miR-134. A SOD3 
level reduction can be caused by miR-328, miR-363. In addition, miR-363 can also 
regulate KLF2 expression. In the course of endometrial cancer, the phenomenon of 
oxidative stress is observed, the regulation of which may be influenced by 
miRNAs."
1379,"Here, we examined the dynamics of the gut and respiratory microbiomes in severe 
COVID-19 patients in need of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit 
(ICU). We recruited 85 critically ill patients (53 with COVID-19 and 32 without 
COVID-19) and 17 healthy controls (HCs) and monitored them for up to 4 weeks. We 
analyzed the bacterial and fungal taxonomic profiles and loads of 232 gut and 
respiratory samples and we measured the blood levels of Interleukin 6, IgG, and 
IgM in COVID-19 patients. Upon ICU admission, the bacterial composition and load 
in the gut and respiratory samples were altered in critically ill patients 
compared with HCs. During their ICU stay, the patients experienced increased 
bacterial and fungal loads, drastic decreased bacterial richness, and 
progressive changes in bacterial and fungal taxonomic profiles. In the gut 
samples, six bacterial taxa could discriminate ICU-COV(+) from ICU-COV(-) cases 
upon ICU admission and the bacterial taxa were associated according to age, 
PaO2/FiO2, and CRP levels. In the respiratory samples of the ICU-COV(+) 
patients, bacterial signatures including Pseudomonas and Streptococcus were 
found to be correlated with the length of ICU stay. Our findings demonstrated 
that the gut and respiratory microbiome dysbiosis and bacterial signatures 
associated with critical illness emerged as biomarkers of COVID-19 severity and 
could be a potential predictor of ICU length of stay. We propose using a 
high-throughput sequencing approach as an alternative to traditional isolation 
techniques to monitor ICU patient infection."
1380,"Cattle-yak, a crossbreed of yak and cattle, which can exhibit obvious heterosis 
and can adapt to the harsh environmental conditions of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau 
(QTP). However, F1 cattle-yak were found to be sterile because they were unable 
to produce sperm, which adversely restricted the fixation of heterosis. Many 
prior attempts have been made to decipher the mechanism underlying the 
spermatogenesis stagnation of cattle-yak. However, the open chromatin region 
(OCR) map of yak and cattle-yak testes has not been generated yet. Here, we have 
analyzed the OCRs landscape of testicular tissues of cattle-yak and yaks by 
performing ATAC-seq technology. The OCRs of cattle-yak and yak testes displayed 
similar genome distribution and showed priority in intergenic regions, introns 
and promoters. The pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the differential 
OCRs-related genes were involved in spermatogenesis, involving the cell cycle, 
as well as Hippo, mTOR, MAPK, Notch, and Wnt signaling pathways. The integration 
of ATAC-seq and mRNA-seq indicated that the majority of the gene expression 
levels were positively correlated with chromatin openness. At the same time, we 
have identified a number of transcription factors (TFs) related to 
spermatogenesis and the differential expression of these TFs may contribute to 
the spermatogenesis stagnation of the cattle-yak. Overall, the findings of this 
study provide valuable information for advancing the research related to yak 
crossbreeding improvement and sperm production stagnation of cattle-yak."
1381,"Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an ultra-rare metabolic disease caused by the accumulation 
of homogentisic acid (HGA), an intermediate product of phenylalanine and 
tyrosine degradation. AKU patients carry variants within the gene coding for 
homogentisate-1,2-dioxygenase (HGD), which are responsible for reducing the 
enzyme catalytic activity and the consequent accumulation of HGA and formation 
of a dark pigment called the ochronotic pigment. In individuals with 
alkaptonuria, ochronotic pigmentation of connective tissues occurs, leading to 
inflammation, degeneration, and eventually osteoarthritis. The molecular 
mechanisms underlying the multisystemic development of the disease severity are 
still not fully understood and are mostly limited to the metabolic pathway 
segment involving HGA. In this view, untargeted metabolomics of biofluids in 
metabolic diseases allows the direct investigation of molecular species involved 
in pathways alterations and their interplay. Here, we present the untargeted 
metabolomics study of AKU through the nuclear magnetic resonance of urine from a 
cohort of Italian patients; the study aims to unravel molecular species and 
mechanisms underlying the AKU metabolic disorder. Dysregulation of metabolic 
pathways other than the HGD route and new potential biomarkers beyond 
homogentisate are suggested, contributing to a more comprehensive molecular 
signature definition for AKU and the development of future adjuvant treatment."
1382,"Hyperprogressive disease (HPD), an aggressive acceleration of tumor growth, was 
observed in a group of cancer patients treated with anti-PD1/PDL1 antibodies. 
The presence of a peculiar macrophage subset in the tumor microenvironment is 
reported to be a sort of ""immunological prerequisite"" for HPD development. These 
macrophages possess a unique phenotype that it is not clear how they acquire. We 
hypothesized that certain malignant cells may promote the induction of an 
""HPD-related"" phenotype in macrophages. Bone-marrow-derived macrophages were 
exposed to the conditioned medium of five non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. 
Macrophage phenotype was analyzed by microarray gene expression profile and 
real-time PCR. We found that human NSCLC cell lines, reported as undergoing 
HPD-like tumor growth in immunodeficient mice, polarized macrophages towards a 
peculiar pro-inflammatory phenotype sharing both M1 and M2 features. Lipid-based 
factors contained in cancer cell-conditioned medium induced the over-expression 
of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of innate immune 
receptor signaling pathways. We also determined that tumor-derived Extracellular 
Vesicles represent the main components involved in the observed macrophage 
re-education program. The present study might represent the starting point for 
the future development of diagnostic tools to identify potential 
hyperprogressors."
1383,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small endogenous RNA that play pivotal roles 
in both the differentiation and function of adipocytes during the development of 
obesity. Despite this, only a few miRNA families have been identified as key 
players in adipogenesis. Here, we show the relevance of the miR-19 family, 
miR-19a and miR-19b, in lipid accumulation and the expansion of the adipose 
tissue in obesity. We observed that miR-19s were upregulated in the abdominal 
subcutaneous adipose tissue (aSAT) of human patients with morbid obesity, 
whereas after bariatric surgery, their expression was reduced. In vitro 
experiments identified miR-19a and b as crucial actors in adipogenesis and lipid 
accumulation. Overall, our results suggest a novel role of the miR-19 family in 
the regulatory networks underlying adipogenesis and, therefore, adipose tissue 
dysfunction."
1384,"Abscisic acid (ABA) protects citrus fruit against Penicillium digitatum 
infection. The global mechanisms involved in the role of ABA in the P. 
digitatum-citrus fruit interaction are unknown. Here, we determine the 
transcriptome differences between the Navelate (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) 
orange and its ABA-deficient mutant Pinalate, which is less resistant to 
infection. Low ABA levels may affect both the constitutive mechanisms that 
protect citrus fruit against P. digitatum and early responses to infection. The 
repression of terpenoid, phenylpropanoid and glutation metabolism; of 
oxidation-reduction processes; and of processes related to the defense response 
to fungus and plant hormone signal transduction may be one part of the 
constitutive defense reduced in the mutant against P. digitatum. Our results 
also provide potential targets for developing P. digitatum-citrus 
fruit-resistant varieties. Of those up-regulated by ABA, a thaumatin protein and 
a bifunctional inhibitor/LTP, which are relevant in plant immunity, were 
particularly remarkable. It is also worth highlighting chlorophyllase 1 (CLH1), 
induced by infection in Pinalate, and the OXS3 gene, which was down-regulated by 
ABA, because the absence of OXS3 activates ABA-responsive genes in plants."
1385,"Abnormalities in hematological parameters of peripheral blood have been noted in 
patients with endogenous Cushing's Syndrome (CS) in the corticotropin 
(ACTH)-dependent and ACTH-independent forms. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism 
of glucocorticoids (GCs) action on human hematopoiesis is still not entirely 
clear. The aim of the study was to determine whether endogenous excessive 
production of GCs could affect apoptosis of CD34+ cells enriched in 
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) collected from the peripheral 
blood of newly diagnosed CS patients. Flow cytometry, Annexin-V enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay, TUNEL assay, real-time quantitative PCR, and microarray 
RNA/miRNA techniques were used to characterize CS patients' HSPCs. We found that 
the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein expression levels in CS were higher 
than in healthy controls. A complex analysis of apoptotic status of CS patients' 
HSPC cells showed that GCs significantly augmented apoptosis in peripheral 
blood-derived CD34+ cells and results obtained using different methods to detect 
early and late apoptosis in analyzed cell population were consistent. CS was 
also associated with significant upregulation in several members of the BCL-2 
superfamily and other genes associated with apoptosis control. Furthermore, 
global gene expression analysis revealed significantly higher expression of 
genes associated with programmed cell death control in HSPCs from CS patients. 
These findings suggest that human endogenous GCs have a direct pro-apoptotic 
activity in hematopoietic CD34+ cells derived from CS subjects before treatment."
1386,"BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most frequently mutated genes in ovarian cancer (OC) 
crucial both for the identification of cancer predisposition and therapeutic 
choices. However, germline variants in other genes could be involved in OC 
susceptibility. We characterized OC patients to detect mutations in genes other 
than BRCA1/2 that could be associated with a high risk of developing OC and 
permit patients to enter the most appropriate treatment and surveillance 
program. Next-generation sequencing analysis with a 94-gene panel was performed 
on germline DNA of 219 OC patients. We identified 34 pathogenic/likely 
pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 and 38 in other 21 genes. The patients with 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in the non-BRCA1/2 genes mainly developed 
OC alone compared to the other groups that also developed breast cancer or other 
tumors (p = 0.001). Clinical correlation analysis showed that the low-risk 
patients were significantly associated with platinum sensitivity (p &lt; 0.001). 
Regarding PARP inhibitors (PARPi) response, the patients with pathogenic 
mutations in the non-BRCA1/2 genes had worse PFS and OS. Moreover, a 
statistically significantly worse PFS was found for every increase of one 
thousand platelets before PARPi treatment. To conclude, knowledge about 
molecular alterations in genes beyond BRCA1/2 in OC could allow for more 
personalized diagnostic, predictive, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies for 
OC patients."
1387,"Antipsychotics (AP) induced prolongation of the QT interval in patients with 
schizophrenia (Sch) is an actual interdisciplinary problem as it increases the 
risk of sudden death syndrome. Long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a cardiac adverse drug 
reaction is a multifactorial symptomatic disorder, the development of which is 
influenced by modifying factors (APs' dose, duration of APs therapy, APs 
polytherapy, and monotherapy, etc.) and non-modifying factors (genetic 
predisposition, gender, age, etc.). The genetic predisposition to AP-induced 
LQTS may be due to several causes, including causal mutations in the genes 
responsible for monoheme forms of LQTS, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of the 
candidate genes encoding voltage-dependent ion channels expressed both in the 
brain and in the heart, and SNVs of candidate genes encoding key enzymes of APs 
metabolism. This narrative review summarizes the results of genetic studies on 
AP-induced LQTS and proposes a new personalized approach to assessing the risk 
of its development (low, moderate, high). We recommend implementation in 
protocols of primary diagnosis of AP-induced LQTS and medication dispensary 
additional observations of the risk category of patients receiving APs, 
deoxyribonucleic acid profiling, regular electrocardiogram monitoring, and 
regular therapeutic drug monitoring of the blood APs levels."
1388,"Human platelet lysate (HPL) is an efficient alternative for animal serum 
supplements, significantly enhancing stromal cell proliferation. However, the 
molecular mechanism behind this growth-promoting effect remains elusive. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the effect of HPL on cell cycle gene expression 
in different human stromal cells and to identify the main key players that 
mediate HPL's growth-enhancing effect. RT-qPCR and an antibody array revealed 
significant upregulation of cell cycle genes in stromal cells cultured in HPL. 
As HPL is rich in growth factors that are ligands of tyrosine kinase receptor 
(TKR) pathways, we used TKR inhibitors and could significantly reduce cell 
proliferation. Genome profiling, RT-qPCR and Western blotting revealed an 
enhanced expression of the transcription factors signal transducer and activator 
of transcription 3 (STAT3) and MYC, both known TKR downstream effectors and 
stimulators of cell proliferation, in response to HPL. In addition, specifically 
blocking STAT3 resulted in reduced cell proliferation and expression of cell 
cycle genes. Our data indicate that HPL-enhanced cell proliferation can, at 
least in part, be explained by the TKR-enhanced expression of STAT3 and MYC, 
which in turn induce the expression of genes being involved in the promotion and 
control of the cell cycle."
1389,"Current therapeutic strategies for spinal cord injury (SCI) cannot fully 
facilitate neural regeneration or improve function. Arginine decarboxylase (ADC) 
synthesizes agmatine, an endogenous primary amine with neuroprotective effects. 
Transfection of human ADC (hADC) gene exerts protective effects after injury in 
murine brain-derived neural precursor cells (mNPCs). Following from these 
findings, we investigated the effects of hADC-mNPC transplantation in SCI model 
mice. Mice with experimentally damaged spinal cords were divided into three 
groups, separately transplanted with fluorescently labeled (1) control mNPCs, 
(2) retroviral vector (pLXSN)-infected mNPCs (pLXSN-mNPCs), and (3) hADC-mNPCs. 
Behavioral comparisons between groups were conducted weekly up to 6 weeks after 
SCI, and urine volume was measured up to 2 weeks after SCI. A subset of animals 
was euthanized each week after cell transplantation for molecular and 
histological analyses. The transplantation groups experienced significantly 
improved behavioral function, with the best recovery occurring in hADC-mNPC 
mice. Transplanting hADC-mNPCs improved neurological outcomes, induced 
oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination, increased neural lineage 
differentiation, and decreased glial scar formation. Moreover, locomotor and 
bladder function were both rehabilitated. These beneficial effects are likely 
related to differential BMP-2/4/7 expression in neuronal cells, providing an 
empirical basis for gene therapy as a curative SCI treatment option."
1390,"Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a heterotrimeric transcription factor that binds to 
the CCAAT cis-element in the promoters of target genes and plays critical roles 
in plant growth, development, and stress responses. In the present study, we 
aimed to re-characterize the ClNF-Y family in watermelon, examine the assembly 
of ClNF-Y complexes, and explore their possible involvement in disease 
resistance. A total of 25 ClNF-Y genes (7 ClNF-YAs, 10 ClNF-YBs, and 8 ClNF-YCs) 
were identified in the watermelon genome. The ClNF-Y family was comprehensively 
characterized in terms of gene and protein structures, phylogenetic 
relationships, and evolution events. Different types of cis-elements responsible 
for plant growth and development, phytohormones, and/or stress responses were 
identified in the promoters of the ClNF-Y genes. ClNF-YAs and ClNF-YCs were 
mainly localized in the nucleus, while most of the ClNF-YBs were localized in 
the cytoplasm of cells. ClNF-YB5, -YB6, -YB7, -YB8, -YB9, and -YB10 interacted 
with ClNF-YC2, -YC3, -YC4, -YC5, -YC6, -YC7, and -YC8, while ClNF-YB1 and -YB3 
interacted with ClNF-YC1. A total of 37 putative ClNF-Y complexes were 
identified, e.g., ClNF-YA1, -YA2, -YA3, and -YA7 assembled into 13, 8, 8, and 8 
ClNF-Y complexes with different ClNF-YB/-YC heterodimers. Most of the ClNF-Y 
genes responded with distinct expression patterns to defense hormones such as 
salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid, and ethylene precursor 
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate, and to infection by the vascular infecting 
fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum. Overexpression of ClNF-YB1, -YB8, -YB9, 
ClNF-YC2, and -YC7 in transgenic Arabidopsis resulted in an earlier flowering 
phenotype. Overexpression of ClNF-YB8 in Arabidopsis led to enhanced resistance 
while overexpression of ClNF-YA2 and -YC2 resulted in decreased resistance 
against Botrytis cinerea. Similarly, overexpression of ClNF-YA3, -YB1, and -YC4 
strengthened resistance while overexpression of ClNF-YA2 and -YB8 attenuated 
resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. The 
re-characterization of the ClNF-Y family provides a basis from which to 
investigate the biological functions of ClNF-Y genes in respect of growth, 
development, and stress response in watermelon, and the identification of the 
functions of some ClNF-Y genes in disease resistance enables further exploration 
of the molecular mechanism of ClNF-Ys in the regulation of watermelon immunity 
against diverse pathogens."
1391,"As a well-known cancer-related miRNA, miR-193b-3p is enriched in skeletal muscle 
and dysregulated in muscle disease. However, the mechanism underpinning this has 
not been addressed so far. Here, we probed the impact of miR-193b-3p on 
myogenesis by mainly using goat tissues and skeletal muscle satellite cells 
(MuSCs), compared with mouse C2C12 myoblasts. miR-193b-3p is highly expressed in 
goat skeletal muscles, and ectopic miR-193b-3p promotes MuSCs proliferation and 
differentiation. Moreover, insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA-binding protein 1 
(IGF2BP1) is the most activated insulin signaling gene when there is 
overexpression of miR-193b-3p; the miRNA recognition element (MRE) within the 
IGF1BP1 3' untranslated region (UTR) is indispensable for its activation. 
Consistently, expression patterns and functions of IGF2BP1 were similar to those 
of miR-193b-3p in tissues and MuSCs. In comparison, ectopic miR-193b-3p failed 
to induce PAX7 expression and myoblast proliferation when there was IGF2BP1 
knockdown. Furthermore, miR-193b-3p destabilized IGF2BP1 mRNA, but unexpectedly 
promoted levels of IGF2BP1 heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA), dramatically. Moreover, 
miR-193b-3p could induce its neighboring genes. However, miR-193b-3p inversely 
regulated IGF2BP1 and myoblast proliferation in the mouse C2C12 myoblast. These 
data unveil that goat miR-193b-3p promotes myoblast proliferation via activating 
IGF2BP1 by binding to its 3' UTR. Our novel findings highlight the positive 
regulation between miRNA and its target genes in muscle development, which 
further extends the repertoire of miRNA functions."
1392,"Scopula subpunctaria, an abundant pest in tea gardens, produce type-II sex 
pheromone components, which are critical for its communicative and reproductive 
abilities; however, genes encoding the proteins involved in the detection of 
type-II sex pheromone components have rarely been documented in moths. In the 
present study, we sequenced the transcriptomes of the male and female S. 
subpunctaria antennae. A total of 150 candidate olfaction genes, comprising 58 
odorant receptors (SsubORs), 26 ionotropic receptors (SsubIRs), 24 chemosensory 
proteins (SsubCSPs), 40 odorant-binding proteins (SsubOBPs), and 2 sensory 
neuron membrane proteins (SsubSNMPs) were identified in S. subpunctaria. 
Phylogenetic analysis, qPCR, and mRNA abundance analysis results suggested that 
SsubOR46 may be the Orco (non-traditional odorant receptor, a subfamily of ORs) 
of S. subpunctaria. SsubOR9, SsubOR53, and SsubOR55 belonged to the pheromone 
receptor (PR) clades which have a higher expression in male antennae. 
Interestingly, SsubOR44 was uniquely expressed in the antennae, with a higher 
expression in males than in females. SsubOBP25, SsubOBP27, and SsubOBP28 were 
clustered into the moth pheromone-binding protein (PBP) sub-family, and they 
were uniquely expressed in the antennae, with a higher expression in males than 
in females. SsubOBP19, a member of the GOBP2 group, was the most abundant OBP in 
the antennae. These findings indicate that these olfactory genes, comprising 
five candidate PRs, three candidate PBPs, and one candidate GOBP2, may be 
involved in type II sex pheromone detection. As well as these genes, most of the 
remaining SsubORs, and all of the SsubIRs, showed a considerably higher 
expression in the female antennae than in the male antennae. Many of these, 
including SsubOR40, SsubOR42, SsubOR43, and SsubIR26, were more abundant in 
female antennae. These olfactory and ionotropic receptors may be related to the 
detection of host plant volatiles. The results of this present study provide a 
basis for exploring the olfaction mechanisms in S. subpunctaria, with a focus on 
the genes involved in type II sex pheromones. The evolutionary analyses in our 
study provide new insights into the differentiation and evolution of 
lepidopteran PRs."
1393,"Starch is a major component of crop grains, and its content affects food quality 
and taste. Tartary buckwheat is a traditional pseudo-cereal used in food as well 
as medicine. Starch content, granule morphology, and physicochemical properties 
have been extensively studied in Tartary buckwheat. However, the complex 
regulatory network related to its starch biosynthesis needs to be elucidated. 
Here, we performed RNA-seq analyses using seven Tartary buckwheat varieties 
differing in starch content and combined the RNA-seq data with starch content by 
weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). As a result, 10,873 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and were functionally 
clustered to six hierarchical clusters. Fifteen starch biosynthesis genes had 
higher expression level in seeds. Four trait-specific modules and 3131 hub genes 
were identified by WGCNA, with the lightcyan and brown modules positively 
correlated with starch-related traits. Furthermore, two potential gene 
regulatory networks were proposed, including the co-expression of FtNAC70, 
FtPUL, and FtGBSS1-3 in the lightcyan module and FtbHLH5, C3H, FtBE2, FtISA3, 
FtSS3-5, and FtSS1 in the brown. All the above genes were preferentially 
expressed in seeds, further suggesting their role in seed starch biosynthesis. 
These results provide crucial guidance for further research on starch 
biosynthesis and its regulatory network in Tartary buckwheat."
1394,"Skeletal muscle is programmable, and early-life nutritional stimuli may form 
epigenetic memory in the skeletal muscle, thus impacting adult muscle function, 
aging, and longevity. In the present study, we designed a one-month protein 
restriction model using post-weaning rats, followed by a two-month rebound 
feeding, to investigate how early-life protein restriction affects overall body 
growth and muscle development and whether these influences could be corrected by 
rebound feeding. We observed comprehensive alterations immediately after protein 
restriction, including retarded growth, altered biochemical indices, and 
disturbed hormone secretion. Transcriptome profiling of the gastrocnemius muscle 
followed by gene ontology analyses revealed that ""myogenic differentiation 
functions"" were upregulated, while ""protein catabolism"" was downregulated as a 
compensatory mechanism, with enhanced endoplasmic reticulum stress and undesired 
apoptosis. Furthermore, methylome profiling of the gastrocnemius muscle showed 
that protein restriction altered the methylation of apoptotic and hormone 
secretion-related genes. Although most of the alterations were reversed after 
rebound feeding, 17 genes, most of which play roles during muscle development, 
remained altered at the transcriptional level. In summary, early-life protein 
restriction may undermine muscle function in the long term and affect skeletal 
muscle development at the both transcriptional and methylation levels, which may 
hazard future muscle health."
1395,"Trihelix (TH) proteins are a family of plant-specific transcription factors that 
play a role in light response and are extensively involved in plant growth and 
development, as well as in various stress responses. However, the function of TH 
genes in Brassica napus (B. napus) remains unclear, as does the evolution and 
differentiation pattern of TH genes in Brassica plants. Here, we identified a 
total of 455 TH genes in seven species, including six Brassica species and 
Arabidopsis, which were grouped into five clades, GT-1, GT-2, GTγ, SH4, and 
SIP1, each with 69, 142, 44, 55, and 145 members, respectively. The types and 
distributions of motifs of the TH proteins and the structures of the TH genes 
are conserved in the same subgroup, and some variations in certain amino acid 
residues occur in B. napus when inheriting motifs from Brassica rapa (B. rapa) 
and Brassica oleracea (B. oleracea). Collinearity analysis revealed that the 
massive expansion of TH genes in tetraploid species was attributed to the 
hetero-tetraploidization of diploid ancestors and gene duplication events within 
the tetraploid species. Comparative analysis of the membership numbers of five 
subgroups in different species revealed that the GT-2 and SIP1 genes underwent 
significant expansion during evolution, possibly to support the better 
adaptation of plants to their environments. The differential expression of the 
BnaTH genes under five stresses indicates that the BnaTH genes are involved in 
plant responses to stresses such as drought, cold, and heat. The presence of 
different stress-responsive cis-elements in the upstream promoter region of the 
genes indicated that BnaTH genes have the potential to cope with variable 
environments. Meanwhile, qRT-PCR analyses also confirmed that five TH genes 
respond to different abiotic stresses. Our results provide information and 
candidates for further studies on the role of TH genes in stress resistance of 
B. napus."
1396,"Excess fat deposition in broilers leads to great economic losses and is harmful 
to consumers' health. Chronic stress in the life cycle of chickens could be an 
important trigger. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this 
study, 30-day-old chickens were subcutaneously injected with 2 mg/kg 
corticosterone (CORT) twice a day for 14 days to simulate long-term stress. It 
was shown that chronic CORT exposure significantly increased plasma triglyceride 
concentrations and enlarged the adipocyte sizes in chickens. Meanwhile, chronic 
CORT administration significantly enlarged the adipocyte sizes, increased the 
protein contents of FASN and decreased HSL, ATGL, Beclin1 and PPARA protein 
levels. Moreover, global m6A methylations were significantly reduced and 
accompanied by downregulated METTL3 and YTHDF2 protein expression by CORT 
treatment. Interestingly, the significant differences of site-specific m6A 
demethylation were observed in exon7 of PPARA mRNA. Additionally, a mutation of 
the m6A site in the PPARA gene fused GFP and revealed that demethylated RRACH in 
PPARA CDS impaired protein translation in vitro. In conclusion, these results 
indicated that m6A-mediated PPARA translational suppression contributes to 
CORT-induced visceral fat deposition in chickens, which may provide a new target 
for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome."
1397,"Cancers are defined by genetic defects, which underlines the prospect of using 
gene therapy in patient care. During the past decade, CRISPR technology has 
rapidly evolved into a powerful gene editing tool with high fidelity and 
precision. However, one of the impediments slowing down the clinical translation 
of CRISPR-based gene therapy concerns the lack of ideal delivery vectors. 
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized membrane sacs naturally released 
from nearly all types of cells. Although EVs are secreted for bio-information 
conveyance among cells or tissues, they have been recognized as superior vectors 
for drug or gene delivery. Recently, emerging evidence has spotlighted EVs in 
CRISPR delivery towards cancer treatment. In this review, we briefly introduce 
the biology and function of the CRISPR system and follow this with a summary of 
current delivery methods for CRISPR applications. We emphasize the recent 
progress in EV-mediated CRISPR editing for various cancer types and target 
genes. The reported strategies for constructing EV-CRISPR vectors, as well as 
their limitations, are discussed in detail. The review aims to throw light on 
the clinical potential of engineered EVs and encourage the expansion of our 
available toolkit to defeat cancer."
1398,"β-thalassemia is one of the most common monogenic disorders and a 
life-threatening health issue in children. A cost-effective and safe therapeutic 
approach to treat this disease is to reactivate the γ-globin gene for fetal 
hemoglobin (HbF) production that has been silenced during infancy. Hydroxyurea 
(HU) is the only FDA approved HbF inducer. However, its cytotoxicity and 
inability to respond significantly in all patients pose a need for an HbF 
inducer with better efficacy. The study describes the serum metabolic alteration 
in β-YAC transgenic mice treated with Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) (n = 
5), a newly identified HbF inducer, and compared to the mice groups treated with 
HU (n = 5) and untreated control (n = 5) using gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry. Various univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were 
performed to identify discriminant metabolites that altered the biological 
pathways encompassing galactose metabolism, lactose degradation, and inositol. 
Furthermore, the decreased concentrations of L-fucose and geraniol in 
TDF-treated mice help in recovering towards normal, decreasing oxidative stress 
even much better than the HU-treated mice. The proposed study suggested that TDF 
can reduce the deficiency of blood required for β-thalassemia and can be used 
for the preclinical study at phase I/II for fetal hemoglobin production."
1399,"Hearing loss is one of the most genetically heterogeneous disorders known. Over 
120 genes are reportedly associated with non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). To 
date, in Russia, there have been relatively few studies that apply massive 
parallel sequencing (MPS) methods to elucidate the genetic factors underlying 
non-GJB2-related hearing loss cases. The current study is intended to provide an 
understanding of the mutation spectrum in non-GJB2-related hearing loss in a 
cohort of Russian sensorineural NSHL patients and establish the best diagnostic 
algorithm. Genetic testing using an MPS panel, which included 33 NSHL and 
syndromic hearing loss (SHL) genes that might be misdiagnosed as NSHL genes, was 
completed on 226 sequentially accrued and unrelated patients. As a result, the 
molecular basis of deafness was found in 21% of the non-GJB2 NSHL cases. The 
total contribution pathogenic, and likely pathogenic, variants in the genes 
studied among all hereditary NSHL Russian patients was 12%. STRC pathogenic and 
likely pathogenic, variants accounted for 30% of diagnoses in GJB2-negative 
patients, providing the most common diagnosis. The majority of causative 
mutations in STRC involved large copy number variants (CNVs) (80%). Among the 
point mutations, the most common were c.11864G&gt;A (p.Trp3955*) in the USH2A 
gene, c.2171_2174delTTTG (p.Val724Glyfs*6) in the STRC gene, and c.107A&gt;C 
(p.His36Pro) and c.1001G&gt;T (p.Gly334Val) in the SLC26A4 gene. Pathogenic 
variants in genes involved in SHL accounted for almost half of the cases with an 
established molecular genetic diagnosis, which were 10% of the total cohort of 
patients with non-GJB2-related hearing loss."
1400,"Our understanding of the regulatory processes of reepithelialization during 
wound healing is incomplete. In an attempt to map the genes involved in 
epidermal regeneration and differentiation, we measured gene expression in 
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded standardized epidermal wounds induced by the 
suction-blister technique with associated nonwounded skin using NanoString 
technology. The transcripts of 139 selected genes involved in clotting, immune 
response to tissue injury, signaling pathways, cell adhesion and proliferation, 
extracellular matrix remodeling, zinc transport and keratinocyte differentiation 
were evaluated. We identified 22 upregulated differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) in descending order of fold change (MMP1, MMP3, IL6, CXCL8, SERPINE1, 
IL1B, PTGS2, HBEGF, CXCL5, CXCL2, TIMP1, CYR61, CXCL1, MMP12, MMP9, HGF, CTGF, 
ITGB3, MT2A, FGF7, COL4A1 and PLAUR). The expression of the most upregulated 
gene, MMP1, correlated strongly with MMP3 followed by IL6 and IL1B. rhIL-1β, but 
not rhIL-6, exposure of cultured normal human epidermal keratinocytes and normal 
human dermal fibroblasts increased both MMP1 mRNA and MMP-1 protein levels, as 
well as TIMP1 mRNA levels. The increased TIMP1 in wounds was validated by 
immunohistochemistry. The six downregulated DEGs (COL7A1, MMP28, SLC39A2, FLG1, 
KRT10 and FLG2) were associated with epidermal maturation. KLK8 showed the 
strongest correlation with MKI67 mRNA levels and is a potential biomarker for 
keratinocyte proliferation. The observed gene expression changes correlate well 
with the current knowledge of physiological reepithelialization. Thus, the gene 
expression panel described in this paper could be used in patients with impaired 
healing to identify possible therapeutic targets."
1401,"Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia of the Charlevoix Saguenay (ARSACS) is caused 
by mutation in the SACS gene resulting in loss of function of the protein 
sacsin. A key feature is the formation of abnormal bundles of neurofilaments 
(NF) in neurons and vimentin intermediate filaments (IF) in cultured 
fibroblasts, suggesting a role of sacsin in IF homeostasis. Sacsin contains a J 
domain (SacsJ) homologous to Hsp40, that can interact with Hsp70 chaperones. The 
SacsJ domain resolved NF bundles in cultured Sacs-/- neurons. Having studied the 
mechanism using NF assembled in vitro from purified NF proteins, we report that 
the SacsJ domain interacts with NF proteins to disassemble NFL filaments, and to 
inhibit their initial assembly. A cell-penetrating peptide derived from this 
domain, SacsJ-myc-TAT was efficient in disassembling NF bundles in cultured 
Sacs-/- motor neurons, restoring the NF network; however, there was some loss of 
vimentin IF and NF in cultured Sacs+/+ fibroblasts and motor neurons, 
respectively. These results suggest that sacsin through its SacsJ domain is a 
key regulator of NF and vimentin IF networks in cells."
1402,"Auxin plays a critical role in organogenesis in plants. The classical auxin 
signaling pathway holds that auxin initiates downstream signal transduction by 
degrading Aux/IAA transcription repressors that interact with ARF transcription 
factors. In this study, 23 MoIAA genes were identified in the drumstick tree 
genome. All MoIAA genes were located within five subfamilies based on 
phylogenetic evolution analysis; the gene characteristics and promoter 
cis-elements were also analyzed. The protein interaction network between the 
MoIAAs with MoARFs was complex. The MoIAA gene family responded positively to 
NAA treatment, exhibiting different patterns and degrees, notably for MoIAA1, 
MoIAA7 and MoIAA13. The three genes expressed and functioned in the nucleus; 
only the intact encoding protein of MoIAA13 exhibited transcriptional activation 
activity. The shoot regeneration capacity in the 35S::MoIAA13-OE transgenic line 
was considerably lower than in the wild type. These results establish a 
foundation for further research on MoIAA gene function and provide useful 
information for improved tissue culture efficiency and molecular breeding of M. 
oleifera."
1403,"Only 3-5% of heavy alcohol users develop acute alcohol pancreatitis (AAP). This 
suggests that additional triggers are required to initiate the inflammatory 
process. Genetic susceptibility contributes to the development of AAP, and 
SPINK1 mutation is a documented risk factor. We investigated the prevalence of 
the SPINK1(N34S) mutation in patients with AAP compared to heavy alcohol users 
who had never suffered an episode of pancreatitis. Blood samples for the 
mutational analysis from patients with first episode (n = 60) and recurrent AAP 
(n = 43) and from heavy alcohol users without a history of AAP (n = 98) as well 
as from a control population (n = 1914) were obtained. SPINK1 mutation was found 
in 8.7% of the patients with AAP. The prevalence was significantly lower in 
healthy controls (3.4%, OR 2.72; 1.32-5.64) and very low in alcoholics without 
pancreatitis (1.0%, OR 9.29; 1.15-74.74). In a comparison adjusted for potential 
cofounders between AAP patients and alcoholics, SPINK1 was found to be an 
independent marker for AAP. The prevalence of the SPINK1 mutation is 
overrepresented in AAP patients and very low in alcoholics without pancreatitis. 
This finding may play a role in understanding the variable susceptibility to AAP 
found in heavy alcohol users."
1404,"In the mouse, two distinct populations of Leydig cells arise during testis 
development. Fetal Leydig cells arise from a stem cell population and produce T 
required for masculinization. It is debated whether they persist in the adult 
testis. A second adult Leydig stem cell population gives rise to 
progenitor-immature-mature adult type Leydig cells that produce T in response to 
LH to maintain spermatogenesis. In testis of adult null male mice lacking either 
only LH (Lhb-/-) or LHR (Lhr-/-), mature Leydig cells are absent but fetal 
Leydig cells persist. Thus, it is not clear whether other ligands signal via 
LHRs in Lhb null mice or LH signals via other receptors in the absence of LHR in 
Lhr null mice. Moreover, it is not clear whether truncated LHR isoforms 
generated from the same Lhr gene promoter encode functionally relevant LH 
receptors. To determine the in vivo roles of LH-LHR signaling pathway in the 
Leydig cell lineage, we generated double null mutant mice lacking both LH Ligand 
and all forms of LHR. Phenotypic analysis indicated testis morpho-histological 
characteristics are identical among double null and single mutants which all 
showed poorly developed interstitium with a reduction in Leydig cell number and 
absence of late stage spermatids. Gene expression analyses confirmed that the 
majority of the T biosynthesis pathway enzyme-encoding mRNAs expressed in Leydig 
cells were all suppressed. Expression of thrombospondin-2, a fetal Leydig cell 
marker gene was upregulated in single and double null mutants indicating that 
fetal Leydig cells originate and develop independent of LH-LHR signaling pathway 
in vivo. Serum and intratesticular T levels were similarly suppressed in single 
and double mutants. Consequently, expression of AR-regulated genes in Sertoli 
and germ cells were similarly affected in single and double mutants without any 
evidence of any additive effect in the combined absence of both LH and LHR. Our 
studies unequivocally provide genetic evidence that in the mouse testis, fetal 
Leydig cells do not require LH-LHR signaling pathway and a one-to-one LH 
ligand-LHR signaling pathway exists in vivo to regulate adult Leydig cell 
lineage and spermatogenesis."
1405,"Early responsive dehydration (ERD) genes can be rapidly induced by dehydration. 
ERD15 genes have been confirmed to regulate various stress responses in plants. 
However, the maize ERD15 members have not been characterized. In the present 
study, a total of five ZmERD15 genes were identified from the maize genome and 
named ZmERD15a, ZmERD15b, ZmERD15c, ZmERD15d, and ZmERD15e. Subsequently, their 
protein properties, gene structure and duplication, chromosomal location, 
cis-acting elements, subcellular localization, expression pattern, and 
over-expression in yeast were analyzed. The results showed that the ZmERD15 
proteins were characterized by a similar size (113-159 aa) and contained a 
common domain structure, with PAM2 and adjacent PAE1 motifs followed by an 
acidic region. The ZmERD15 proteins exhibited a close phylogenetic relationship 
with OsERD15s from rice. Five ZmERD15 genes were distributed on maize 
chromosomes 2, 6, 7, and 9 and showed a different exon-intron organization and 
were expanded by duplication. Besides, the promoter region of the ZmERD15s 
contained abundant cis-acting elements that are known to be responsive to stress 
and hormones. Subcellular localization showed that ZmERD15b and ZmERD15c were 
localized in the nucleus. ZmERD15a and ZmERD15e were localized in the nucleus 
and cytoplasm. ZmERD15d was localized in the nucleus and cell membrane. The 
results of the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the expression 
of the ZmERD15 genes was regulated by PEG, salinity, and ABA. The heterologous 
expression of ZmERD15a, ZmERD15b, ZmERD15c, and ZmERD15d significantly enhanced 
salt tolerance in yeast. In summary, a comprehensive analysis of ZmERD15s was 
conducted in the study. The results will provide insights into further 
dissecting the biological function and molecular mechanism of ZmERD15s 
regulating of the stress response in maize."
1406,"In recent years, miR528, a monocot-specific miRNA, has been assigned 
multifaceted roles during development and stress response in several plant 
species. However, the transcription regulation and the molecular mechanisms 
controlling MIR528 expression in maize are still poorly explored. Here we 
analyzed the zma-MIR528a promoter region and found conserved transcription 
factor binding sites related to diverse signaling pathways, including the 
nitrate (TGA1/4) and auxin (AuxRE) response networks. Accumulation of both 
pre-miR528a and mature miR528 was up-regulated by exogenous nitrate and auxin 
treatments during imbibition, germination, and maize seedling establishment. 
Functional promoter analyses demonstrated that TGA1/4 and AuxRE sites are 
required for transcriptional induction by both stimuli. Overall, our findings of 
the nitrogen- and auxin-induced zma-MIR528a expression through cis-regulatory 
elements in its promoter contribute to the knowledge of miR528 regulome."
1407,"Trehalose and trehalose-6 phosphate played important roles in floral organ 
development, embryonic development, cell morphogenesis, and signal transduction 
under abiotic stress. However, little is known about the trehalose-6-phosphate 
synthase (TPS) gene family in Brassica napus. In this study, in total, 26 TPS 
genes in B. napus (BnTPS genes) were identified and classified into two groups. 
In each group, the BnTPS genes showed relatively conserved gene structures. The 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and enrichment analysis indicated that 
BnTPS genes were involved in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fructose and 
mannose metabolism, galactose metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, 
carbohydrate transmembrane transport, trehalose-phosphatase activity, etc. The 
expression of BnTPS genes varied greatly across different tissues, while most of 
the BnTPS genes showed a considerable improvement in expression under different 
abiotic stresses, indicating that BnTPS genes were significantly responsive to 
the abiotic treatments. In addition, the association mapping analysis revealed 
that eight BnTPS genes were potential regulators of particular agronomic traits. 
Among them, the gene BnTPS23 was significantly associated with the primary 
flowering time (PFT), full flowering time (FFT1), and final flowering time 
(FFT2), suggesting that BnTPS genes may play an important role in regulating key 
agronomic traits in B. napus. In summary, our research provides a better 
understanding of BnTPS genes, facilitates the breeding of superior B. napus 
varieties, and paves the way for future functional studies."
1408,"Flowering and bud dormancy are crucial stages in the life cycle of perennial 
angiosperms in temperate climates. MADS-box family genes are involved in many 
plant growth and development processes. Here, we identified three MADS-box genes 
in tea plant belonging to the FLOWERING LOCUS C (CsFLC) family. We monitored 
CsFLC1 transcription throughout the year and found that CsFLC1 was expressed at 
a higher level during the winter bud dormancy and flowering phases. To clarify 
the function of CsFLC1, we developed transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants 
heterologously expressing 35S::CsFLC1. These lines bolted and bloomed earlier 
than the WT (Col-0), and the seed germination rate was inversely proportional to 
the increased CsFLC1 expression level. The RNA-seq of 35S::CsFLC1 transgenic 
Arabidopsis showed that many genes responding to ageing, flower development and 
leaf senescence were affected, and phytohormone-related pathways were especially 
enriched. According to the results of hormone content detection and RNA 
transcript level analysis, CsFLC1 controls flowering time possibly by regulating 
SOC1, AGL42, SEP3 and AP3 and hormone signaling, accumulation and metabolism. 
This is the first time a study has identified FLC-like genes and characterized 
CsFLC1 in tea plant. Our results suggest that CsFLC1 might play dual roles in 
flowering and winter bud dormancy and provide new insight into the molecular 
mechanisms of FLC in tea plants as well as other plant species."
1409,"Glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs) are among the most clinically successful 
antimicrobials. GPAs inhibit cell-wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria 
via binding to lipid II. Natural GPAs are produced by various actinobacteria. 
Being themselves Gram-positives, the GPA producers evolved sophisticated 
mechanisms of self-resistance to avoid suicide during antibiotic production. 
These self-resistance genes are considered the primary source of GPA resistance 
genes actually spreading among pathogenic enterococci and staphylococci. The 
GPA-resistance mechanism in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus-the producer of the 
last-resort-drug teicoplanin-has been intensively studied in recent years, 
posing relevant questions about the role of Tei3 sensor histidine kinase. In the 
current work, the molecular properties of Tei3 were investigated. The setup of a 
GPA-responsive assay system in the model Streptomyces coelicolor allowed us to 
demonstrate that Tei3 functions as a non-inducible kinase, conferring high 
levels of GPA resistance in A.&amp;nbsp;teichomyceticus. The expression of 
different truncated versions of tei3 in S.&amp;nbsp;coelicolor indicated that 
both the transmembrane helices of Tei3 are crucial for proper functioning. 
Finally, a hybrid gene was constructed, coding for a chimera protein combining 
the Tei3 sensor domain with the kinase domain of VanS, with the latter being the 
inducible Tei3 ortholog from S. coelicolor. Surprisingly, such a chimera did not 
respond to teicoplanin, but indeed to the related GPA A40926. Coupling these 
experimental results with a further in silico analysis, a novel scenario on 
GPA-resistance and biosynthetic genes co-evolution in 
A.&amp;nbsp;teichomyceticus was hereby proposed."
1410,"The purpose of this study was to identify the hub genes and biological pathways 
of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) through bioinformatics analysis and potential 
new therapeutic targets. In this study, three datasets were downloaded from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 
NPC and normal tissues were analyzed using the GEO2R online tool. Volcano and 
heat maps of the DEGs were visualized using the hiplot database. Gene ontology 
(GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment 
analyses of the upregulated and downregulated DEGs were performed using the 
DAVID database. Finally, we established a protein-protein interaction (PPI) 
network using the STRING database and showed the differential expression of hub 
genes between the normal and tumor tissues. In all, 109,371,221 upregulated DEGs 
and 139,226,520 downregulated DEGs were obtained in datasets GSE40290, GSE61218, 
and GSE53819, respectively, and 18 common differential genes, named co-DEGs, 
were screened in the three datasets. The most abundant biological GO terms of 
the co-DEGs were inflammatory response et al. The KEGG pathway enrichment 
analysis showed that co-DEGs mainly participated in the interleukin (IL)-17 
signaling pathway et al. Finally, we identified four hub genes using PPI 
analysis and observed that three of them were highly expressed in tumor tissues. 
In this study, the hub genes of NPC, such as PTGS2, and pathways such as IL-17 
signaling, were identified through bioinformatics analysis, which may be 
potential new therapeutic targets for NPC."
1411,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly 
contagious and pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 and caused a 
pandemic of respiratory illness termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
Cancer patients are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The treatment of 
cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is more complicated, and the patients 
are at risk of poor prognosis compared to other populations. Patients infected 
with SARS-CoV-2 are prone to rapid development of acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) of which pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is considered a sequelae. Both 
ARDS and PF are factors that contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. 
However, the molecular mechanisms among COVID-19, ARDS and PF in COVID-19 
patients with cancer are not well-understood. In this study, the common 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between COVID-19 patients with and without 
cancer were identified. Based on the common DEGs, a series of analyses were 
performed, including Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis, protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network construction and hub gene extraction, transcription 
factor (TF)-DEG regulatory network construction, TF-DEG-miRNA coregulatory 
network construction and drug molecule identification. The candidate drug 
molecules (e.g., Tamibarotene CTD 00002527) obtained by this study might be 
helpful for effective therapeutic targets in COVID-19 patients with cancer. In 
addition, the common DEGs among ARDS, PF and COVID-19 patients with and without 
cancer are TNFSF10 and IFITM2. These two genes may serve as potential 
therapeutic targets in the treatment of COVID-19 patients with cancer. Changes 
in the expression levels of TNFSF10 and IFITM2 in CD14+/CD16+ monocytes may 
affect the immune response of COVID-19 patients. Specifically, changes in the 
expression level of TNFSF10 in monocytes can be considered as an immune 
signature in COVID-19 patients with hematologic cancer. Targeting 
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) pathways (e.g., METTL3/SERPINA1 axis) to restrict 
SARS-CoV-2 reproduction has therapeutic potential for COVID-19 patients."
1412,"Soybean is frequently attacked by herbivorous pests throughout the growth 
period. Exploring anti-insect genes to improve insect resistance in soybean is 
an important soybean breeding goal. Here, we cloned and characterized the gene 
for a quantitative trait locus (QTL) related to insect resistance, 
Glyma.06g189600, which encodes CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE17 (GmCDPK17) in 
soybean. The pairwise sequence alignment analysis revealed that the presumed 
protein of GmCDPK17 shares 52.06% similarity with that of GmCDPK38, a known 
negative regulatory gene of insect resistance in soybean. Ectopic expression of 
GmCDPK17 and GmCDPK38 restored the phenotypes of the Arabidopsis 
insect-susceptible mutant cpk10 and insect-resistant mutant cpk28, respectively. 
Moreover, transgenic hairy roots of the soybean cultivar Jack were generated by 
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Overexpression of GmCDPK17 increased 
soybean hairy root resistance to common cutworm (CCW), while RNA interference of 
the gene decreased soybean hairy root resistance to CCW. Sequencing data from 
the cultivated and wild soybeans were used to analyze the genetic diversity of 
GmCDPK17. This gene was subjected to domestication selection. Six and seven 
haplotypes (Haps) were identified in cultivated and wild soybeans, respectively. 
The resistance Hap1 is not widely used in cultivated soybeans and is mainly 
distributed at low latitudes. Accessions with resistance haplotypes of the 
GmCDPK17 and GmCDPK38 genes showed high resistance to CCW. Altogether, we 
revealed a novel positive regulatory insect resistance gene, GmCDPK17, which may 
further improve insect resistance in soybean."
1413,"The herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.) is widely cultivated as an 
ornamental, medicinal and edible plant in China. Drought stress can seriously 
affect the growth of herbaceous peony and reduce its quality. In our previous 
research, a significantly differentially expressed gene, PM19L, was obtained in 
herbaceous peony under drought stress based on transcriptome analysis, but 
little is known about its function. In this study, the first PM19L that was 
isolated in herbaceous peony was comprised of 910 bp, and was designated as 
PlPM19L (OP480984). It had a complete open reading frame of 537 bp and encoded a 
178-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 18.95 kDa, which was located 
in the membrane. When PlPM19L was transferred into tobacco, the transgenic 
plants had enhanced tolerance to drought stress, potentially due to the increase 
in the abscisic acid (ABA) content and the reduction in the level of hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2). In addition, the enhanced ability to scavenge H2O2 under 
drought stress led to improvements in the enzyme activity and the potential 
photosynthetic capacity. These results combined suggest that PlPM19L is a key 
factor to conferring drought stress tolerance in herbaceous peony and provide a 
scientific theoretical basis for the following improvement in the drought 
resistance of herbaceous peony and other plants through genetic engineering 
technology."
1414,"Multiple myeloma (MM) has a highly heterogeneous genetic background, which 
complicates its molecular tracking over time. Nevertheless, each MM patient's 
malignant plasma cells (PCs) share unique V(D)J rearranged sequences at 
immunoglobulin loci, which represent ideal disease biomarkers. Because the 
tumor-specific V(D)J sequence is highly expressed in bulk RNA in MM patients, we 
wondered whether it can be identified by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). 
To this end we analyzed CD138+ cells purified from bone marrow aspirates of 19 
samples with PC dyscrasias by both a standard method based on bulk DNA and by an 
implementation of the standard 10x Genomics protocol to detect expressed V(D)J 
sequences. A dominant clonotype was easily identified in each sample, accounting 
on average for 83.65% of V(D)J-rearranged cells. Compared with standard methods, 
scRNA-seq analysis proved highly concordant and even more effective in 
identifying clonal productive rearrangements, by-passing limitations related to 
the misannealing of consensus primers in hypermutated regions. We next validated 
its accuracy to track 5 clonal cells with absolute sensitivity in a virtual 
sample containing 3180 polyclonal cells. This shows that single-cell V(D)J 
analysis may be used to find rare clonal cells, laying the foundations for 
functional single-cell dissection of minimal residual disease."
1415,"Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, E.C.4.3.1.5) catalyzes the benzene propane 
metabolism and is the most extensively studied enzyme of the phenylpropanoid 
pathway. However, the role of PAL genes in Astragalus membranaceus, a non-model 
plant showing high capability toward abiotic stress, is less studied. Here, we 
cloned AmPAL and found that it encodes a protein that resides in the cytoplasmic 
membrane. The mRNA of AmPAL was strongly induced by NaCl or NaHCO3 treatment, 
especially in the root. Overexpressing AmPAL in Nicotiana tabacum resulted in 
higher PAL enzyme activities, lower levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), and better 
root elongation in the seedlings under stress treatment compared to the control 
plants. The protective role of AmPAL under saline-alkali stress was also 
observed in 30-day soil-grown plants, which showed higher levels of superoxide 
dismutase (SOD), proline, and chlorophyll compared to wild-type N. Tabacum. 
Collectively, we provide evidence that AmPAL is responsive to multiple abiotic 
stresses and that manipulating the expression of AmPAL can be used to increase 
the tolerance to adverse environmental factors in plants."
1416,"Insects vastly outnumber us in terms of species and total biomass, and are among 
the most efficient and voracious consumers of plants on the planet. As a result, 
to preserve crops, one of the primary tasks in agriculture has always been the 
need to control and reduce the number of insect pests. The current use of 
chemical insecticides leads to the accumulation of xenobiotics in ecosystems and 
a decreased number of species in those ecosystems, including insects. 
Sustainable development of human society is impossible without useful insects, 
so the control of insect pests must be effective and selective at the same time. 
In this article, we show for the first time a natural way to regulate the number 
of insect pests based on the use of extracellular double-stranded DNA secreted 
by the plant Pittosporum tobira. Using a principle similar to one found in 
nature, we show that the topical application of artificially synthesized short 
antisense oligonucleotide insecticides (olinscides, DNA insecticides) is an 
effective and selective way to control the insect Coccus hesperidum. Using 
contact oligonucleotide insecticide Coccus-11 at a concentration of 100 ng/μL on 
C. hesperidum larvae resulted in a mortality of 95.59 ± 1.63% within 12 days. 
Green oligonucleotide insecticides, created by nature and later discovered by 
humans, demonstrate a new method to control insect pests that is beneficial and 
safe for macromolecular insect pest management."
1417,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer diagnosed among women in the world, 
with an ever-increasing incidence rate. Due to the dynamic increase in the 
occurrence of risk factors, including obesity and related metabolic disorders, 
the search for new regulatory mechanisms is necessary. This will help a complete 
understanding of the pathogenesis of breast cancer. The review presents the 
mechanisms of obesity as a factor that increases the risk of developing breast 
cancer and that even initiates the cancer process in the female population. The 
mechanisms presented in the paper relate to the inflammatory process resulting 
from current or progressive obesity leading to cell metabolism disorders and 
disturbed hormonal metabolism. All these processes are widely regulated by the 
action of microRNAs (miRNAs), which may constitute potential biomarkers 
influencing the pathogenesis of breast cancer and may be a promising target of 
anti-cancer therapies."
1418,"Some cephalopods (squids, octopuses, and cuttlefishes) produce dynamic 
structural colors, for camouflage or communication. The key to this remarkable 
capability is one group of specialized cells called iridocytes, which contain 
aligned membrane-enclosed platelets of high-reflective reflectins and work as 
intracellular Bragg reflectors. These reflectins have unusual amino acid 
compositions and sequential properties, which endows them with functional 
characteristics: an extremely high reflective index among natural proteins and 
the ability to answer various environmental stimuli. Based on their unique 
material composition and responsive self-organization properties, the material 
community has developed an impressive array of reflectin- or iridocyte-inspired 
optical systems with distinct tunable reflectance according to a series of 
internal and external factors. More recently, scientists have made creative 
attempts to engineer mammalian cells to explore the function potentials of 
reflectin proteins as well as their working mechanism in the cellular 
environment. Progress in wide scientific areas (biophysics, genomics, gene 
editing, etc.) brings in new opportunities to better understand reflectins and 
new approaches to fully utilize them. The work introduced the composition 
features, biochemical properties, the latest developments, future considerations 
of reflectins, and their inspiration applications to give newcomers a 
comprehensive understanding and mutually exchanged knowledge from different 
communities (e.g., biology and material)."
1419,"Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is one of the most aggressive skin tumors with a poor 
prognosis. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of regulated cell death that 
is closely associated with cancer development and immunotherapy. The aim of this 
study was to establish and validate a ferroptosis-related gene (FRG) DNA 
methylation signature to predict the prognosis of CM patients using data from 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A 
reliable four-FRG DNA methylation prognostic signature was constructed via Cox 
regression analysis based on TCGA database. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 
patients in the high-risk group tended to have a shorter overall survival (OS) 
than the low-risk group in both training TCGA and validation GEO cohorts. 
Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed the areas 
under the curve (AUC) at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.738, 0.730, and 0.770 in TCGA 
cohort and 0.773, 0.775, and 0.905 in the validation cohort, respectively. 
Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that the signature 
was an independent prognostic indicator of OS in patients with CM. Immunogenomic 
profiling showed the low-risk group of patients had a higher immunophenoscore, 
and most immune checkpoints were negatively associated with the risk signature. 
Functional enrichment analysis revealed that immune response and immune-related 
pathways were enriched in the low-risk group. In conclusion, we established and 
validated a four-FRG DNA methylation signature that independently predicts 
prognosis in CM patients. This signature was strongly correlated with the immune 
landscape, and may serve as a biomarker to guide clinicians in making more 
precise and personalized treatment decisions for CM patients."
1420,"A defection of blood circulation in the brain leads to ischemia, damage, and the 
death of nerve cells. It is known that individual populations of GABAergic 
neurons are the least resistant to the damaging factors of ischemia and 
therefore they die first of all, which leads to impaired inhibition in neuronal 
networks. To date, the neuroprotective properties of a number of calcium-binding 
proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin), which are markers of 
GABAergic neurons, are known. Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is a signaling 
protein that is expressed in all types of neurons and is involved in the 
regulation of neurotransmission. The role of NCS-1 in the protection of neurons 
and especially their individual populations from ischemia and hyperexcitation 
has not been practically studied. In this work, using the methods of 
fluorescence microscopy, vitality tests, immunocytochemistry, and PCR analysis, 
the molecular mechanisms of the protective action of NCS-1 in 
ischemia/reoxygenation and hyperammonemia were established. Since NCS-1 is most 
expressed in GABAergic neurons, the knockdown of this protein with siRNA led to 
the most pronounced consequences in GABAergic neurons. The knockdown of NCS-1 
(NCS-1-KD) suppressed the basic expression of protective proteins without 
significantly reducing cell viability. However, ischemia-like conditions 
(oxygen-glucose deprivation, OGD) and subsequent 24-h reoxygenation led to a 
more massive activation of apoptosis and necrosis in neurons with NCS-1-KD, 
compared to control cells. The mass death of NCS-1-KD cells during OGD and 
hyperammonemia has been associated with the induction of a more pronounced 
network hyperexcitation symptom, especially in the population of GABAergic 
neurons, leading to a global increase in cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i). The 
symptom of hyperexcitation of neurons with NCS-1-KD correlated with a decrease 
in the level of expression of the calcium-binding protein-parvalbumin. This was 
accompanied by an increase in the expression of excitatory ionotropic glutamate 
receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate and 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (NMDAR and AMPAR) 
against the background of suppression of the expression of glutamate 
decarboxylase (synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid)."
1421,"Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a core component of polycomb repressive 
complex 2 that plays a vital role in transcriptional repression of gene 
expression. Conditional ablation of EZH2 using progesterone receptor (Pgr)-Cre 
in the mouse uterus has uncovered its roles in regulating uterine epithelial 
cell growth and stratification, suppressing decidual myofibroblast activation, 
and maintaining normal female fertility. However, it is unclear whether EZH2 
plays a role in the development of uterine glands, which are required for 
pregnancy success. Herein, we created mice with conditional deletion of Ezh2 
using anti-Mullerian hormone receptor type 2 (Amhr2)-Cre recombinase that is 
expressed in mesenchyme-derived cells of the female reproductive tract. 
Strikingly, these mice showed marked defects in uterine adenogenesis. Unlike 
Ezh2 Pgr-Cre conditional knockout mice, deletion of Ezh2 using Amhr2-Cre did not 
lead to the differentiation of basal-like cells in the uterus. The deficient 
uterine adenogenesis was accompanied by impaired uterine function and pregnancy 
loss. Transcriptomic profiling using next generation sequencing revealed 
dysregulation of genes associated with signaling pathways that play fundamental 
roles in development and disease. In summary, this study has identified an 
unrecognized role of EZH2 in uterine gland development, a postnatal event 
critical for pregnancy success and female fertility."
1422,"Histone deacetylase inhibitors show synergy with several genotoxic drugs. 
Herein, we investigated the biological impact of the combined treatment of 
panobinostat and melphalan in multiple myeloma (MM). DNA damage response (DDR) 
parameters and the expression of DDR-associated genes were analyzed in bone 
marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 
26 newly diagnosed MM patients. PBMCs from 25 healthy controls (HC) were 
examined in parallel. Compared with the ex vivo melphalan-only treatment, 
combined treatment with panobinostat and melphalan significantly reduced the 
efficiency of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and double-strand-break repair 
(DSB/R), enhanced the accumulation of DNA lesions (monoadducts and DSBs), and 
increased the apoptosis rate only in patients' BMPCs (all p &lt; 0.001); 
marginal changes were observed in PBMCs from the same patients or HC. 
Accordingly, panobinostat pre-treatment decreased the expression levels of 
critical NER (DDB2, XPC) and DSB/R (MRE11A, PRKDC/DNAPKc, RAD50, XRCC6/Ku70) 
genes only in patients' BMPCs; no significant changes were observed in PBMCs 
from patients or HC. Together, our findings demonstrate that panobinostat 
significantly increased the melphalan sensitivity of malignant BMPCs without 
increasing the melphalan sensitivity of PBMCs from the same patients, thus 
paving the way for combination therapies in MM with improved anti-myeloma 
efficacy and lower side effects."
1423,"Blood-based biomarkers are needed for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). We analyzed longitudinal human plasma samples from AD and control cases to 
identify biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD. Plasma samples were grouped 
based on clinical diagnosis at the time of collection: AD, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and pre-symptomatic (preMCI). Samples were analyzed by ELISA 
using a panel of reagents against nine different AD-related amyloid-β (Aβ), tau, 
or TDP-43 variants. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of different 
biomarker panels for different diagnostic sample groups were determined. 
Analysis of all of the samples gave a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 76% 
for the diagnosis of AD. Early-stage diagnosis of AD, utilizing only the preMCI 
and MCI samples, identified 88% of AD cases. Using sex-biased biomarker panels, 
early diagnosis of AD cases improved to 96%. Using the sex-biased panels, we 
also identified 6 of the 25 control group cases as being at high risk of AD, 
which is consistent with what is expected given the advanced age of the control 
cases. Specific AD-associated protein variants are effective blood-based 
biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD. Notably, significant differences were 
observed in biomarker profiles for the early detection of male and female AD 
cases."
1424,"The receptor tyrosine kinase Ret plays a critical role in regulating enteric 
nervous system (ENS) development. Ret is important for proliferation, migration, 
and survival of enteric progenitor cells (EPCs). Ret also promotes neuronal 
fate, but its role during neuronal differentiation and in the adult ENS is less 
well understood. Inactivating RET mutations are associated with ENS diseases, 
e.g., Hirschsprung Disease, in which distal bowel lacks ENS cells. Zebrafish is 
an established model system for studying ENS development and modeling human ENS 
diseases. One advantage of the zebrafish model system is that their embryos are 
transparent, allowing visualization of developmental phenotypes in live animals. 
However, we lack tools to monitor Ret expression in live zebrafish. Here, we 
developed a new BAC transgenic line that expresses GFP under the ret promoter. 
We find that EPCs and the majority of ENS neurons express ret:GFP during ENS 
development. In the adult ENS, GFP+ neurons are equally present in females and 
males. In homozygous mutants of ret and sox10-another important ENS 
developmental regulator gene-GFP+ ENS cells are absent. In summary, we 
characterize a ret:GFP transgenic line as a new tool to visualize and study the 
Ret signaling pathway from early development through adulthood."
1425,"Ammonium (NH4+), as a major inorganic source of nitrogen (N) for tea plant 
growth, is transported and distributed across membranes by the proteins of 
ammonium transporters (AMTs). However, the AMT2-type AMTs from tea plants remain 
poorly understood. In this study, five CsAMT2 subfamily genes were identified in 
tea plant genomes, and their full-length coding sequences (CDS) were isolated 
from roots. Then, a NH4+ uptake kinetic comparison of Fudingdabaicha (FD), 
Huangdan (HD), and Maoxie (MX) showed that FD was a high N efficiency (HNE) 
cultivar that had a wide range of adaptability to NH4+, HD was a high N 
efficiency under high N conditions (HNEH) cultivar, in which it was easy to 
obtain higher yield in a high N environment, and MX was a high N efficiency 
under low N conditions (HNEL) cultivar, which had a higher affinity for NH4+ 
than the other two. Tissue-specific expression analysis suggested that CsAMT2.2 
and CsAMT2.3 were highly expressed in the roots, indicating that these two 
members may be unique in the CsAMT2 subfamily. This is further supported by our 
findings from the temporal expression profiles in the roots among these three 
different N adaptation cultivars. Expression levels of CsAMT2.2 and CsAMT2.3 in 
FD and HD were upregulated by a short time (2 h) under high NH4+ treatment, 
while under low NH4+ treatment, CsAMT2.2 and CsAMT2.3 were highly expressed at 0 
h and 2 h in the HNEL-type cultivar-MX. Furthermore, the functional analysis 
illustrated that CsAMT2.2 and CsAMT2.3 could make a functional complementation 
of NH4+-defective mutant yeast cells at low NH4+ levels, and the transport 
efficiency of CsAMT2.3 was higher than that of CsAMT2.2. Thus, we concluded that 
CsAMT2.2 and CsAMT2.3 might play roles in controlling the NH4+ uptake from the 
soil to the roots. These results will further the understanding of the NH4+ 
signal networks of AMT2-type proteins in tea plants."
1426,"The tremendous majority of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data so far neglected intra-host 
genetic diversity. Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies based on data 
generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of complete genomes. SARS-CoV-2 
raw NGS data had been generated for nasopharyngeal samples collected between 
March 2020 and February 2021 by the Illumina technology on a MiSeq instrument, 
without prior PCR amplification. To analyze viral quasispecies, we designed and 
implemented an in-house Excel file (""QuasiS"") that can characterize intra-sample 
nucleotide diversity along the genomes using data of the mapping of NGS reads. 
We compared intra-sample genetic diversity and global genetic diversity 
available from Nextstrain. Hierarchical clustering of all samples based on the 
intra-sample genetic diversity was performed and visualized with the Morpheus 
web application. NGS mapping data from 110 SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory 
samples characterized by a mean depth of 169 NGS reads/nucleotide position and 
for which consensus genomes that had been obtained were classified into 15 viral 
lineages were analyzed. Mean intra-sample nucleotide diversity was 0.21 ± 0.65%, 
and 5357 positions (17.9%) exhibited significant (&gt;4%) diversity, in ≥2 
genomes for 1730 (5.8%) of them. ORF10, spike, and N genes had the highest 
number of positions exhibiting diversity (0.56%, 0.34%, and 0.24%, 
respectively). Nine hot spots of intra-sample diversity were identified in the 
SARS-CoV-2 NSP6, NSP12, ORF8, and N genes. Hierarchical clustering delineated a 
set of six genomes of different lineages characterized by 920 positions 
exhibiting intra-sample diversity. In addition, 118 nucleotide positions (0.4%) 
exhibited diversity at both intra- and inter-patient levels. Overall, the 
present study illustrates that the SARS-CoV-2 consensus genome sequences are 
only an incomplete and imperfect representation of the entire viral population 
infecting a patient, and that quasispecies analysis may allow deciphering more 
accurately the viral evolutionary pathways."
1427,"Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is an epigenetic reader that binds to 
methylated CpG dinucleotides and regulates gene transcription. Mecp2/MECP2 gene 
has 4 exons, encoding for protein isoforms MeCP2E1 and MeCP2E2. MeCP2 plays key 
roles in neurodevelopment, therefore, its gain- and loss-of-function mutations 
lead to neurodevelopmental disorders including Rett Syndrome. Here, we describe 
the structure, functional domains, and evidence support for potential additional 
alternatively spliced MECP2 transcripts and protein isoforms. We conclude that 
NCBI MeCP2 isoforms 3 and 4 contain certain MeCP2 functional domains. Our in 
silico analysis led to identification of histone modification and accessibility 
profiles at the MECP2 gene and its cis-regulatory elements. We conclude that the 
human MECP2 gene associated histone post-translational modifications exhibit 
high similarity between males and females. Between brain regions, histone 
modifications were found to be less conserved and enriched within larger genomic 
segments named as ""S1-S11"". We also identified highly conserved DNA 
accessibility regions in different tissues and brain regions, named as ""A1-A9"" 
and ""B1-B9"". DNA methylation profile was similar between mid-frontal gyrus of 
donors 35 days-25 years of age. Based on ATAC-seq data, the identified 
hypomethylated regions ""H1-H8"" intersected with most regions of the accessible 
chromatin (A regions)."
1428,"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) refers to a widespread signaling system and its 
alteration is implicated in a growing number of human diseases. Cannabinoid 
receptors (CBRs) are highly expressed in the central nervous system and many 
peripheral tissues. Evidence suggests that CB1Rs are expressed in human and 
murine skeletal muscle mainly in the cell membrane, but a subpopulation is 
present also in the mitochondria. However, very little is known about the latter 
population. To date, the connection between the function of CB1Rs and the 
regulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling has not been investigated yet. 
Tamoxifen-inducible skeletal muscle-specific conditional CB1 knock-down 
(skmCB1-KD, hereafter referred to as Cre+/-) mice were used in this study for 
functional and morphological analysis. After confirming CB1R down-regulation on 
the mRNA and protein level, we performed in vitro muscle force measurements and 
found that peak twitch, tetanus, and fatigue were decreased significantly in 
Cre+/- mice. Resting intracellular calcium concentration, voltage dependence of 
the calcium transients as well as the activity dependent mitochondrial calcium 
uptake were essentially unaltered by Cnr1 gene manipulation. Nevertheless, we 
found striking differences in the ultrastructural architecture of the 
mitochondrial network of muscle tissue from the Cre+/- mice. Our results suggest 
a role of CB1Rs in maintaining physiological muscle function and morphology. 
Targeting ECS could be a potential tool in certain diseases, including muscular 
dystrophies where increased endocannabinoid levels have already been described."
1429,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a clinical respiratory disease caused by various 
factors, which lacks effective pharmacotherapy to reduce the mortality rate. 
Elsholtzia bodinieri Vaniot is an annual herbaceous plant used as a traditional 
herbal tea and folk medicine. Here we used bioinformatic databases and software 
to explore and analyze the potential key genes in ALI regulated by E. bodinieri 
Vaniot, including B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), prostaglandin-endoperoxide 
synthase 2 (Ptgs2) and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (Nqo1). In an 
inflammatory cells model, we verified bioinformatics results, and further 
mechanistic analysis showed that methanol extract of E. bodinieri Vaniot (EBE) 
could alleviate oxidative stress by upregulating the expression of NQO1, 
suppress pyroptosis by upregulating the expression of BCL2, and attenuate 
inflammation by downregulating the expression of PTGS2. In sum, our results 
demonstrated that EBE treatment could alleviate oxidative stress, suppress 
pyroptosis and attenuate inflammation by regulating NQO1, BCL2 and PTGS2 in a 
cells model, and E. bodinieri Vaniot might be a promising source for functional 
food or as a therapeutic agent."
1430,"The forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors (TFs) family are frequently 
mutated, deleted, or amplified in various human cancers, making them attractive 
candidates for therapy. However, their roles in pan-cancer remain unclear. Here, 
we evaluated the expression, prognostic value, mutation, methylation, and 
clinical features of four FOXO family genes (FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6) in 
33 types of cancers based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype Tissue 
Expression (GTEx) databases. We used a single sample gene set enrichment 
analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm to establish a novel index called ""FOXOs score"". 
Moreover, we investigated the association between the FOXOs score and tumor 
microenvironment (TME), the responses to multiple treatments, along with drug 
resistance. We found that the FOXO family genes participated in tumor 
progression and were related to the prognosis in various types of cancer. We 
calculated the FOXOs score and found that it was significantly correlated with 
multiple malignant pathways in pan-cancer, including Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, 
TGF-beta signaling, and hedgehog signaling. In addition, the FOXOs score was 
also associated with multiple immune-related characteristics. Furthermore, the 
FOXOs score was sensitive for predicting the efficacy of diverse treatments in 
multiple cancers, especially immunotherapy. In conclusion, FOXO family genes 
were vital in pan-cancer and were strongly correlated with the TME. A high FOXOs 
score indicated an excellent immune-activated TME and sensitivity to multiple 
treatments. Hence, the FOXOs score might potentially be used as a biomarker in 
patients with a tumor."
1431,"""Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus"" (CLas) is a phloem-restricted 
α-proteobacterium that is associated with citrus huanglongbing (HLB), which is 
the most destructive disease that affects all varieties of citrus. Although 
midrib is usually used as a material for CLas detection, we recently found that 
the bacterium was enriched in fruits, especially in the fruit pith. However, no 
study has revealed the molecular basis of these two parts in responding to CLas 
infection. Therefore, we performed transcriptome and UHPLC-MS-based targeted and 
untargeted metabolomics analyses in order to organize the essential genes and 
metabolites that are involved. Transcriptome and metabolome characterized 4834 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 383 differentially accumulated 
metabolites (DAMs) between the two materials, wherein 179 DEGs and 44 DAMs were 
affected by HLB in both of the tissues, involving the pathways of 
phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, phytohormone signaling transduction, starch and 
sucrose metabolism, and photosynthesis. Notably, we discovered that the gene 
expression that is related to beta-glucosidase and endoglucanase was 
up-regulated in fruits. In addition, defense-related gene expression and 
metabolite accumulation were significantly down-regulated in infected fruits. 
Taken together, the decreased amount of jasmonic acid, coupled with the reduced 
accumulation of phenylpropanoid and the increased proliferation of 
indole-3-acetic acid, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid, compared to leaf 
midribs, may contribute largely to the enrichment of CLas in fruit piths, 
resulting in disorders of photosynthesis and starch and sucrose metabolism."
1432,"Chromosomal rearrangements in N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis were studied 
with the determination of mobile elements and their role in rearrangements. The 
results of whole-genome sequencing and de novo genome assembly for 50 N. 
gonorrhoeae isolates collected in Russia were compared with 96 genomes of N. 
gonorrhoeae and 138 genomes of N. meningitidis from the databases. Rearrangement 
events with the determination of the coordinates of syntenic blocks were 
analyzed using the SibeliaZ software v.1.2.5, the minimum number of events that 
allow one genome to pass into another was calculated using the DCJ-indel model 
using the UniMoG program v.1.0. Population-level analysis revealed a stronger 
correlation between changes in the gene order and phylogenetic proximity for N. 
meningitidis in contrast to N. gonorrhoeae. Mobile elements were identified, 
including Correa elements; Spencer-Smith elements (in N. gonorrhoeae); 
Neisserial intergenic mosaic elements; IS elements of IS5, IS30, IS110, IS1595 
groups; Nf1-Nf3 prophages; NgoФ1-NgoФ9 prophages; and Mu-like prophages Pnm1, 
Pnm2, MuMenB (in N. meningitidis). More than 44% of the observed rearrangements 
most likely occurred with the participation of mobile elements, including 
prophages. No differences were found between the Russian and global N. 
gonorrhoeae population both in terms of rearrangement events and in the number 
of transposable elements in genomes."
1433,"The colibactin island (pks) of Escherichia coli formed by 19 genes (55-Kb), 
encodes non-ribosomal peptide (NRP) and polyketide (PK) synthases, which allow 
the synthesis of colibactin, a suspected hybrid PK-NRP compound that causes 
damage to DNA in eukaryotic cells. The clbP, an unusual essential gene, is found 
in the operon structure with the clbS gene in the pks-encoded machinery. 
Interestingly, the clbP gene has been annotated as a β-lactamase but no previous 
study has reported its β-lactamase characteristics. In this study, we (i) 
investigated the β-lactamase properties of the clbP gene in silico by analysing 
its phylogenetic relationship with bacterial β-lactamase and peptidase enzymes, 
(ii) compared its three-dimensional (3D) protein structure with those of 
bacterial β-lactamase proteins using the Phyr2 database and PyMOL software, and 
(iii) evaluated in vitro its putative enzymatic activities, including 
β-lactamase, nuclease, and ribonuclease using protein expression and 
purification from an E. coli BL21 strain. In this study, we reveal a structural 
configuration of toxin/antitoxin systems in this island. Thus, similar to the 
toxin/antitoxin systems, the role of the clbP gene within the pks-island gene 
group appears as an antitoxin, insofar as it is responsible for the activation 
of the toxin, which is colibactin. In silico, our analyses revealed that ClbP 
belonged to the superfamily of β-lactamase, class C. Furthermore, in vitro we 
were unable to demonstrate its β-lactamase activity, likely due to the fact that 
the clbP gene requires co-expression with other genes, such as the genes present 
in the pks-island (19 genes). More research is needed to better understand its 
actions, particularly with regards to antibiotics, and to discover whether it 
has any additional functions due to the importance of this gene and its 
toxicity."
1434,"Deletions in the CCM1, CCM2, and CCM3 genes are a common cause of familial 
cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs). In current molecular genetic 
laboratories, targeted next-generation sequencing or multiplex 
ligation-dependent probe amplification are mostly used to identify copy number 
variants (CNVs). However, both techniques are limited in their ability to 
specify the breakpoints of CNVs and identify complex structural variants (SVs). 
To overcome these constraints, we established a targeted Cas9-mediated nanopore 
sequencing approach for CNV detection with single nucleotide resolution. Using a 
MinION device, we achieved complete coverage for the CCM genes and determined 
the exact size of CNVs in positive controls. Long-read sequencing for a CCM1 and 
CCM2 CNV revealed that the adjacent ANKIB1 and NACAD genes were also partially 
or completely deleted. In addition, an interchromosomal insertion and an 
inversion in CCM2 were reliably re-identified by long-read sequencing. The 
refinement of CNV breakpoints by long-read sequencing enabled fast and 
inexpensive PCR-based variant confirmation, which is highly desirable to reduce 
costs in subsequent family analyses. In conclusion, Cas9-mediated nanopore 
sequencing is a cost-effective and flexible tool for molecular genetic 
diagnostics which can be easily adapted to various target regions."
1435,"Hodgkin lymphomas (HLs) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoid neoplasia 
associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV, considered to be an 
important etiological co-factor in approximately 1% of human malignancies, can 
be classified into two genotypes based on EBNA-2, EBNA-3A and EBNA-3C sequences, 
and into genetic variants based on the sequence variation of the gene coding for 
the LMP1 protein. Here, we present the results on the distribution of EBV 
genotypes 1 and 2 as well as LMP1 gene variants in 50 patients with EBV-positive 
classical HL selected from a cohort of 289 histologically verified cases 
collected over a 9-year period in a tertiary clinical center in the Southeast of 
Europe. The population-based sequencing of the EBNA-3C gene showed the exclusive 
presence of EBV genotype 1 in all cHL samples. The analysis of EBV LMP1 variant 
distribution showed a predominance of the wild-type strain B95-8 and the 
Mediterranean subtype with 30 bp deletion. These findings could contribute to 
the understanding of EBV immunobiology in cHL as well as to the development of a 
prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine."
1436,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder 
characterized by periods of activity and remission. IBD includes Crohn's disease 
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), and even though IBD has not been considered as 
a heritable disease, there are genetic variants associated with increased risk 
for the disease. 5-Hydroxytriptamine (5-HT), or serotonin, exerts a wide range 
of gastrointestinal effects under both normal and pathological conditions. 
Furthermore, Serotonin Transporter (SERT) coded by Solute Carrier Family 6 
Member 4 (SLC6A4) gene (located in the 17q11.1-q12 chromosome), possesses 
genetic variants, such as Serotonin Transporter Gene Variable Number Tandem 
Repeat in Intron 2 (STin2-VNTR) and Serotonin-Transporter-linked promoter region 
(5-HTTLPR), which have an influence over the functionality of SERT in the 
re-uptake and bioavailability of serotonin. The intestinal microbiota is a 
crucial actor in normal human gut physiology, exerting effects on serotonin, 
SERT function, and inflammatory processes. As a consequence of abnormal 
serotonin signaling and SERT function under these inflammatory processes, the 
use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been seen to improve 
disease activity and extraintestinal manifestations, such as depression and 
anxiety. The aim of this study is to integrate scientific data linking the 
intestinal microbiota as a regulator of gut serotonin signaling and re-uptake, 
as well as its role in the pathogenesis of IBD. We performed a narrative review, 
including a literature search in the PubMed database of both review and original 
articles (no date restriction), as well as information about the SLC6A4 gene and 
its genetic variants obtained from the Ensembl website. Scientific evidence from 
in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials regarding the use of selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors as an adjuvant therapy in patients with IBD is also 
discussed. A total of 194 articles were used between reviews, in vivo, in vitro 
studies, and clinical trials."
1437,"Flower development is not only an important way for tomato reproduction but also 
an important guarantee for tomato fruit production. Although more and more 
attention has been paid to the study of flower development, there are few 
studies on the molecular mechanism and gene expression level of tomato flower 
development. In this study, RNA-seq analysis was performed on two stages of 
tomato flower development using the Illumina sequencing platform. A total of 
8536 DEGs were obtained by sequencing, including 3873 upregulated DEGs and 4663 
down-regulated DEGs. These differentially expressed genes are related to plant 
hormone signaling, starch and sucrose metabolism. The pathways such as pentose, 
glucuronate interconversion, and Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis are closely 
related and mainly involved in plant cellular and metabolic processes. According 
to the enrichment analysis results of DEGs, active energy metabolism can be 
inferred during flower development, indicating that flower development requires 
a large amount of energy and material supply. In addition, some plant hormones, 
such as GA, may also have effects on flower development. Combined with previous 
studies, the expression levels of Solyc02g087860 and three of bZIPs were 
significantly increased in the full flowering stage compared with the flower bud 
stage, indicating that these genes may be closely related to flower development. 
These genes were previously reported in Arabidopsis but not in tomatoes. Our 
next work will conduct a detailed functional analysis of the identified bZIP 
family genes to characterize their association with tomato flower size. This 
study will provide new genetic resources for flower formation and provide a 
basis for tomato yield breeding."
1438,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the major leading causes of death in 
humans globally. Recently, increased levels of recruited macrophages and 
AGE-albumin were observed in the hearts of humans and animals with acute 
myocardial infarction. Thus, the purposes of this study were to investigate 
whether the elevated levels of AGE-albumin from activated macrophage cells are 
implicated in ischemia-induced cardiomyocyte death and to develop therapeutic 
strategies for AMI based on its underlying molecular mechanisms with respect to 
AGEs. The present study demonstrated that activated macrophages and AGE-albumin 
were observed in heart tissues obtained from humans and rats with AMI 
incidences. In the cellular model of AMI, it was found that increased expression 
of AGE-albumin was shown to be co-localized with macrophages, and the presence 
of AGE-albumin led to increased expression of RAGE through the mitogen-activated 
protein kinase pathway. After revealing cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by 
toxicity of the AGE-RAGE system, sRAGE-secreting MSCs were generated using the 
CRISPR/Cas9 platform to investigate the therapeutic effects of sRAGE-MSCs in an 
AMI rat model. Gene-edited sRAGE-MSCs showed greater therapeutic effects against 
AMI pathogenesis in rat models compared to mock MSCs, and promising results of 
the functional improvement of stem cells could result in significant 
improvements in the clinical management of cardiovascular diseases."
1439,"In this opinion article, we have analyzed the relevancy of a hypothesis which is 
based on the idea that in Arabidopsis thaliana jasmonic acid, a (JA)-mediated 
defense system against necrotrophic fungi is weakened when NO3- supply is high. 
Such a hypothesis is based on the fact that when NO3- supply is high, it induces 
an increase in the amount of bioactive ABA which induces the sequestration of 
the phosphatase ABI2 (PP2C) into the PYR/PYL/RCAR receptor. Consequently, the Ca 
sensors CBL1/9-CIPK23 are not dephosphorylated by ABI2, thus remaining able to 
phosphorylate targets such as AtNPF6.3 and AtKAT1, which are NO3- and K+ 
transporters, respectively. Therefore, the impact of phosphorylation on the 
regulation of these two transporters, could (1) reduce NO3- influx as in its 
phosphorylated state AtNPF6.3 shifts to low capacity state and (2) increase K+ 
influx, as in its phosphorylated state KAT1 becomes more active. It is also well 
known that in roots, K+ loading in the xylem and its transport to the shoot is 
activated in the presence of NO3-. As such, the enrichment of plant tissues in 
K+ can impair a jasmonic acid (JA) regulatory pathway and the induction of the 
corresponding biomarkers. The latter are known to be up-regulated under K+ 
deficiency and inhibited when K+ is resupplied. We therefore suggest that 
increased K+ uptake and tissue content induced by high NO3- supply modifies the 
JA regulatory pathway, resulting in a weakened JA-mediated plant's defense 
system against necrotrophic fungi."
1440,"Expansion and contraction (ebb and flow events) of inverted repeat (IR) 
boundaries occur and are generally considered to be major factors affecting 
chloroplast (cp) genome size changes. Nonetheless, the Adiantum malesianum cp 
genome does not seem to follow this pattern. We sequenced, assembled and 
corrected the A. flabellulatum and A. malesianum cp genomes using the Illumina 
NovaSeq6000 platform, and we performed a comparative genome analysis of six 
Adiantum species. The results revealed differences in the IR/SC boundaries of A. 
malesianum caused by a 6876 bp long rpoB-trnD-GUC intergenic spacer (IGS) in the 
LSC. This IGS may create topological tension towards the LSC/IRb boundary in the 
cp genome, resulting in a sequential movement of the LSC genes. Consequently, 
this leads to changes of the IR/SC boundaries and may even destroy the integrity 
of trnT-UGU, which is located in IRs. This study provides evidence showing that 
it is the large rpoB-trnD-GUC IGS that leads to A. malesianum cp genome size 
change, rather than ebb and flow events. Then, the study provides a model to 
explain how the rpoB-trnD-GUC IGS in LSC affects A. malesianum IR/SC boundaries. 
Moreover, this study also provides useful data for dissecting the evolution of 
cp genomes of Adiantum. In future research, we can expand the sample to 
Pteridaceae to test whether this phenomenon is universal in Pteridaceae."
1441,"Flavonoid, an important secondary metabolite in plants, is involved in many 
biological processes. Its synthesis originates from the phenylpropane metabolic 
pathway, and it is catalyzed by a series of enzymes. The flavonoid biosynthetic 
pathway is regulated by many transcription factors, among which MYB 
transcription factors are thought to be key regulators. Hickory (Carya 
cathayensis) is an economic forest tree species belonging to the Juglandaceae 
family, and its fruit is rich in flavonoids. The transcriptome of exocarp and 
seed of hickory has previously been sequenced and analyzed by our team, 
revealing that CcMYB12 (CCA0691S0036) may be an important regulator of flavonoid 
synthesis. However, the specific regulatory role of CcMYB12 in hickory has not 
been clarified. Through a genome-wide analysis, a total of 153 R2R3-MYB genes 
were identified in hickory, classified into 23 subclasses, of which CcMYB12 was 
located in Subclass 7. The R2R3-MYBs showed a differential expression with the 
development of hickory exocarp and seed, indicating that these genes may 
regulate fruit development and metabolite accumulation. The phylogenetic 
analysis showed that CcMYB12 is a flavonol regulator, and its expression trend 
is the same as or opposite to that of flavonol synthesis-related genes. 
Moreover, CcMYB12 was found to be localized in the nucleus and have 
self-activation ability. The dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that 
CcMYB12 strongly bonded to and activated the promoters of CcC4H, CcCHS, CcCHI, 
and CcF3H, which are key genes of the flavonoid synthesis pathway. 
Overexpression of CcMYB12 in Arabidopsis thaliana could increase the content of 
total flavonoids and the expression of related genes, including PAL, 
C4H,&amp;nbsp;CHS, F3H, F3'H, ANS, and DFR, in the flavonoid synthesis pathway. 
These results reveal that CcMYB12 may directly regulate the expression of 
flavonoid-related genes and promote flavonoid synthesis in hickory fruit. 
Notably, the expression level of CcMYB12 in hickory seedlings was significantly 
boosted under NaCl and PEG treatments, while it was significantly downregulated 
under acid stress, suggesting that CcMYB12 may participate in the response to 
abiotic stresses. The results could provide a basis for further elucidating the 
regulation network of flavonoid biosynthesis and lay a foundation for developing 
new varieties of hickory with high flavonoid content."
1442,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) changes after myocardial infarction (MI) need precise 
regulation, and next-generation sequencing technologies provide omics data that 
can be used in this context. We performed a meta-analysis using RNA-sequencing 
transcriptomic datasets to identify genes involved in post-MI ECM turnover. 
Eight studies available in Gene Expression Omnibus were selected following the 
inclusion criteria. We compare RNA-sequencing data from 92 mice submitted to 
permanent coronary ligation or sham, identifying differentially expressed genes 
(p-value &lt; 0.05 and Log2FoldChange ≥ 2). Functional enrichment analysis was 
performed based on Gene Ontology biological processes (BPs). BPs implicated in 
response to extracellular stimulus, regulation of ECM organization, and ECM 
disassembly were detected soon after ischemia onset. ECM disassembly occurred 
between days one to seven post-MI, compared with ECM assembly from day seven 
onwards. We identified altered mRNA expression of 19 matrix metalloproteinases 
and four tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases at post-infarcted ECM 
remodeling and altered transcriptomic expression of 42 genes encoding 26 
collagen subunits at the fibrotic stage. To our knowledge, this is the first 
meta-analysis using RNA-sequencing datasets to evaluate post-infarcted cardiac 
interstitium healing, revealing previously unknown mechanisms and molecules 
actively implicated in ECM remodeling post-MI, which warrant further validation."
1443,"Evidence is accumulating that the tumour microenvironment (TME) has a key role 
in the progression of gliomas. Non-neoplastic cells in addition to the tumour 
cells are therefore finding increasing attention. Microglia and other 
glioma-associated macrophages are at the centre of this interest especially in 
the context of therapeutic considerations. New ideas have emerged regarding the 
role of microglia and, more recently, blood-derived brain macrophages in 
glioblastoma (GBM) progression. We are now beginning to understand the 
mechanisms that allow malignant glioma cells to weaken microglia and brain 
macrophage defence mechanisms. Surface molecules and cytokines have a prominent 
role in microglia/macrophage-glioma cell interactions, and we discuss them in 
detail. The involvement of exosomes and microRNAs forms another focus of this 
review. In addition, certain microglia and glioma cell pathways deserve special 
attention. These ""synergistic"" (we suggest calling them ""Janus"") pathways are 
active in both glioma cells and microglia/macrophages where they act in concert 
supporting malignant glioma progression. Examples include CCN4 (WISP1)/Integrin 
α6β1/Akt and CHI3L1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR. They represent attractive therapeutic 
targets."
1444,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by MeCP2 
mutations. Nonetheless, the pathophysiological roles of MeCP2 mutations in the 
etiology of intrinsic cardiac abnormality and sudden death remain unclear. In 
this study, we performed a detailed functional studies (calcium and 
electrophysiological analysis) and RNA-sequencing-based transcriptome analysis 
of a pair of isogenic RTT female patient-specific induced pluripotent 
stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) that expressed either MeCP2wildtype 
or MeCP2mutant allele and iPSC-CMs from a non-affected female control. The 
observations were further confirmed by additional experiments, including Wnt 
signaling inhibitor treatment, siRNA-based gene silencing, and ion channel 
blockade. Compared with MeCP2wildtype and control iPSC-CMs, MeCP2mutant iPSC-CMs 
exhibited prolonged action potential and increased frequency of spontaneous 
early after polarization. RNA sequencing analysis revealed up-regulation of 
various Wnt family genes in MeCP2mutant iPSC-CMs. Treatment of MeCP2mutant 
iPSC-CMs with a Wnt inhibitor XAV939 significantly decreased the β-catenin 
protein level and CACN1AC expression and ameliorated their abnormal 
electrophysiological properties. In summary, our data provide novel insight into 
the contribution of activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade to the 
cardiac abnormalities associated with MeCP2 mutations in RTT."
1445,"This study evaluated the mechanism of temperature-controlled repeated thermal 
stimulation (TRTS)-mediated neuronal differentiation. We assessed the effect of 
SP600125, a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, on neuronal differentiation 
of rat PC12-P1F1 cells, which can differentiate into neuron-like cells by 
exposure to TRTS or neurotrophic factors, including bone morphogenetic protein 
(BMP) 4. We evaluated neuritogenesis by incubating the cells under conditions of 
TRTS and/or SP600125. Cotreatment with SP600125 significantly enhanced 
TRTS-mediated neuritogenesis, whereas that with other selective 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors did not-e.g., extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 inhibitor U0126, and p38 MAPK inhibitor 
SB203580. We tried to clarify the mechanism of SP600125 action by testing the 
effect of U0126 and the BMP receptor inhibitor LDN193189 on the 
SP600125-mediated enhancement of intracellular signaling. SP600125-enhanced 
TRTS-induced neuritogenesis was significantly inhibited by U0126 or LDN193189. 
Gene expression analysis revealed that TRTS significantly increased β3-Tubulin, 
MKK3, and Smad7 gene expressions. Additionally, Smad6 and Smad7 gene expressions 
were substantially attenuated through SP600125 co-treatment during TRTS. 
Therefore, SP600125 may partly enhance TRTS-induced neuritogenesis by 
attenuating the negative feedback loop of BMP signaling. Further investigation 
of the mechanisms underlying the effect of SP600125 during TRTS-mediated 
neuritogenesis may contribute to the future development of regenerative 
neuromedicine."
1446,"Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is the most common cause 
of sudden optic nerve (ON)-related vision loss in humans. Study of this disease 
has been limited by the lack of available tissue and difficulties in evaluating 
both treatments and the window of effectiveness after symptom onset. The rodent 
nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy model (rNAION) closely resembles 
clinical NAION in its pathophysiological changes and physiological responses. 
The rNAION model enables analysis of the specific responses to sudden ischemic 
axonopathy and effectiveness of potential treatments. However, there are 
anatomic and genetic differences between human and rodent ON, and the inducing 
factors for the disease and the model are different. These variables can result 
in marked differences in lesion development between the two species, as well as 
in the possible responses to various treatments. These caveats are discussed in 
the current article, as well as some of the species-associated differences that 
may be related to ischemic lesion severity and responses."
1447,"Fatty acid synthase (FASN) promotes tumor progression in multiple cancers. In 
this study, we comprehensively examined the expression, prognostic significance, 
and promoter methylation of FASN, and its correlation with immune cell 
infiltration in pan-cancer. Our results demonstrated that elevated FASN 
expression was significantly associated with an unfavorable prognosis in many 
cancer types. Furthermore, FASN promoter DNA methylation can be used as a tumor 
prognosis marker. Importantly, high levels of FASN were significantly negatively 
correlated with tumor immune infiltration in 35 different cancers. Additionally, 
FASN was significantly associated with tumor mutational burden (TMB) and 
microsatellite instability (MSI) in multiple malignancies, suggesting that it 
may be essential for tumor immunity. We also investigated the effects of FASN 
expression on immunotherapy efficacy and prognosis. In up to 15 tumors, it was 
significantly negatively correlated with immunotherapy-related genes, such as 
PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4. Moreover, we found that tumors with high FASN 
expression may be more sensitive to immunotherapy and have a good prognosis with 
PD-L1 treatment. Finally, we confirmed the tumor-suppressive effect of 
mir-195-5p through FASN. Altogether, our results suggested that FASN may serve 
as a novel prognostic indicator and immunotherapeutic target in various 
malignancies."
1448,"Crucial studies have verified that IAA is mainly generated via the two-step 
pathway in Arabidopsis, in which tryptophan aminotransferase (TAA) and YUCCA 
(YUC) are the two crucial enzymes. However, the role of the TAA (or TAR) and YUC 
genes in allotetraploid oilseed rape underlying auxin biosynthesis and 
development regulation remains elusive. In the present study, all putative TAR 
and YUC genes were identified in B. napus genome. Most TAR and YUC genes were 
tissue that were specifically expressed. Most YUC and TAR proteins contained 
trans-membrane regions and were confirmed to be endoplasmic reticulum 
localizations. Enzymatic activity revealed that YUC and TAR protein members were 
involved in the conversion of IPA to IAA and Trp to IPA, respectively. 
Transgenic plants overexpressing BnaYUC6a in both Arabidopsis and B. napus 
displayed high auxin production and reduced plant branch angle, together with 
increased drought resistance. Moreover, mutation in auxin biosynthesis BnaTARs 
genes by CRISPR/Cas9 caused development defects. All these results suggest the 
convergent role of BnaYUC and BnaTAR genes in auxin biosynthesis. Different 
homoeologs of BnaYUC and BnaTAR may be divergent according to sequence and 
expression variation. Auxin biosynthesis genes in allotetraploid oilseed rape 
play a pivotal role in coordinating plant development processes and stress 
resistance."
1449,"Milk fat is the foremost nutrient of milk and a vital indicator in evaluating 
milk quality. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) are 
involved in the synthesis of milk fat. The miR-200c is closely related to lipid 
metabolism, but little is known about its effect on the synthesis of milk fat in 
MECs of ewes. Herein, the effect of miR-200c on the proliferation of ovine 
mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and its target relationship with a predicted 
target gene were investigated. The regulatory effects of miR-200c on the 
expression of the target genes and the content of triglycerides in ovine MECs 
were further analyzed. The results revealed that the expression level of 
miR-200c was differentially expressed in both eight tissues selected during 
lactation and in mammary gland tissues at different physiological periods. 
Overexpression of miR-200c inhibited the viability and proliferation of ovine 
MECs, while inhibition of miR-200c increased cell viability and promoted the 
proliferation of ovine MECs. Target gene prediction results indicated that 
miR-200c would bind the 3'UTR region of pantothenate kinase 3 (PANK3). 
Overexpression of miR-200c reduced the luciferase activity of PANK3, while 
inhibition of miR-200c increased its luciferase activity. These findings 
illustrated that miR-200c could directly interact with the target site of the 
PANK3. It was further found that overexpression of miR-200c reduced the 
expression levels of PANK3 and, thus, accelerated the synthesis of 
triglycerides. In contrary, the inhibitor of miR-200c promoted the expression of 
PANK3 that, thus, inhibited the synthesis of triglycerides in ovine MECs. 
Together, these findings revealed that miR-200c promotes the triglycerides 
synthesis in ovine MECs via increasing the lipid synthesis related genes 
expression by targeting PANK3."
1450,"Neovascular or ""wet"" age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a leading cause 
of blindness among older adults. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a major 
pathological feature of nAMD, in which abnormal new blood vessel growth from the 
choroid leads to irreversible vision loss. There is a critical need to develop 
novel therapeutic strategies to address limitations of the current anti-vascular 
endothelial growth factor biologics. Previously, we identified soluble epoxide 
hydrolase (sEH) as a possible therapeutic target for CNV through a forward 
chemical genetic approach. The purpose of this study was to validate sEH as a 
target by examining retinal expression of sEH protein and mRNA by 
immunohistochemistry and RNAscope in situ hybridization, respectively, and to 
assess the efficacy of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector designed to knock 
down the sEH gene, Ephx2, in the murine laser-induced (L-) CNV model. nAMD 
patient postmortem eye tissue and murine L-CNV showed overexpression of sEH in 
photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial cells. Ephx2 knockdown 
significantly reduced CNV and normalized mRNA expression levels of CNV-related 
inflammatory markers. Thus, this study further establishes sEH as a promising 
therapeutic target against CNV associated with nAMD."
1451,"In this study, we aimed to investigate whether short-term and low-dose treatment 
with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial drug, can modulate heart function 
in a preclinical model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) expressing the D94A 
mutation in cardiac myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) compared with healthy 
non-transgenic (NTg) littermates. Increased interest in HCQ came with the 
COVID-19 pandemic, but the risk of cardiotoxic side effects of HCQ raised 
concerns, especially in patients with an underlying heart condition, e.g., 
cardiomyopathy. Effects of HCQ treatment vs. placebo (H2O), administered in 
Tg-D94A vs. NTg mice over one month, were studied by echocardiography and muscle 
contractile mechanics. Global longitudinal strain analysis showed the 
HCQ-mediated improvement in heart performance in DCM mice. At the molecular 
level, HCQ promoted the switch from myosin's super-relaxed (SRX) to disordered 
relaxed (DRX) state in DCM-D94A hearts. This result indicated more myosin 
cross-bridges exiting a hypocontractile SRX-OFF state and assuming the DRX-ON 
state, thus potentially enhancing myosin motor function in DCM mice. This 
bottom-up investigation of the pharmacological use of HCQ at the level of myosin 
molecules, muscle fibers, and whole hearts provides novel insights into 
mechanisms by which HCQ therapy mitigates some abnormal phenotypes in DCM-D94A 
mice and causes no harm in healthy NTg hearts."
1452,"The complement system is composed of a complex protein network and is pivotal to 
innate immunity. Complement 3 (C3) is a critical protein in the complement 
cascade and participates in complement activation and immune defense. In this 
study, C3 from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) was cloned and its function 
in resisting pathogen infection was characterized. The full length of OnC3 open 
reading frame is 4974 bp, encoding 1657 aa, and the predicted protein mass 
weight is 185.93 kDa. The OnC3 amino acid sequence contains macroglobulin 
domains. The expression pattern of OnC3 mRNA in the tissues of healthy fish was 
detected, with the highest in the liver and the lowest in the muscle. After 
challenged with Streptococcus agalactiae and Aeromonas hydrophila, the 
expression of OnC3 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in the liver, spleen, and 
head kidney. Further, the recombinant OnC3 protein alleviated the inflammatory 
response and pathological damage of tissues after infected with S. agalactiae. 
Moreover, the OnC3 promoted the phagocytosis of monocytes/macrophages to S. 
agalactiae. The data obtained in this study provide a theoretical reference for 
in-depth understanding of C3 in host defense against bacterial infection and the 
immunomodulatory roles in teleost fish."
1453,"Clubroot, caused by the soilborne pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae, is an 
important disease of canola (Brassica napus) and other crucifers. The recent 
application of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies to study P. brassicae-host 
interactions has generated large amounts of gene expression data, improving 
knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis and host resistance. 
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis has been widely applied to examine the 
expression of a limited number of genes and to validate the results of RNA-seq 
studies, but may not be ideal for analyzing larger suites of target genes or 
increased sample numbers. Moreover, the need for intermediate steps such as cDNA 
synthesis may introduce variability that could affect the accuracy of the data 
generated by qPCR. Here, we report the validation of gene expression data from a 
previous RNA-seq study of clubroot using the NanoString nCounter System, which 
achieves efficient gene expression quantification in a fast and simple manner. 
We first confirm the robustness of the NanoString system by comparing the 
results with those generated by qPCR and RNA-seq and then discuss the importance 
of some candidate genes for resistance or susceptibility to P. brassicae in the 
host. The results show that the expression of genes measured using NanoString 
have a high correlation with the values obtained using the other two 
technologies, with R &gt; 0.90 and p &lt; 0.01, and the same expression patterns 
for most genes. The three methods (qPCR, RNA-seq, and NanoString) were also 
compared in terms of laboratory procedures, time, and cost. We propose that the 
NanoString nCounter System is a robust, sensitive, highly reproducible, and 
simple technology for gene expression analysis. NanoString could become a common 
alternative to qPCR to validate RNA-seq data or to create panels of genes for 
use as markers of resistance/susceptibility when plants are challenged with 
different P. brassicae pathotypes."
1454,"A reoccurring issue in neuroepigenomic studies, especially in the context of 
neurodegenerative disease, is the use of (heterogeneous) bulk tissue, which 
generates noise during epigenetic profiling. A workable solution to this issue 
is to quantify epigenetic patterns in individually isolated neuronal cells using 
laser capture microdissection (LCM). For this purpose, we established a novel 
approach for targeted DNA methylation profiling of individual genes that relies 
on a combination of LCM and limiting dilution bisulfite pyrosequencing (LDBSP). 
Using this approach, we determined cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) methylation 
rates of single alleles derived from 50 neurons that were isolated from unfixed 
post-mortem brain tissue. In the present manuscript, we describe the general 
workflow and, as a showcase, demonstrate how targeted methylation analysis of 
various genes, in this case, RHBDF2, OXT, TNXB, DNAJB13, PGLYRP1, C3, and LMX1B, 
can be performed simultaneously. By doing so, we describe an adapted data 
analysis pipeline for LDBSP, allowing one to include and correct CpG methylation 
rates derived from multi-allele reactions. In addition, we show that the 
efficiency of LDBSP on DNA derived from LCM neurons is similar to the efficiency 
obtained in previously published studies using this technique on other cell 
types. Overall, the method described here provides the user with a more accurate 
estimation of the DNA methylation status of each target gene in the analyzed 
cell pools, thereby adding further validity to this approach."
1455,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are distributed in various species and play 
critical roles in plant growth, development, and defence against stimuli. 
However, the lncRNA response to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment has not been 
well characterized in Nicotiana tabacum Bright Yellow-2 (BY-2) cells, and their 
roles in plant defence remain elusive. Here, 7848 reliably expressed lncRNAs 
were identified in BY-2 cells, of which 629 differentially expressed (DE) 
lncRNAs were characterized as MeJA-responsive lncRNAs. The lncRNAs in BY-2 cells 
had a strong genus specificity in Nicotiana. The combined analysis of the 
cis-regulated lncRNAs and their target genes revealed the potential up- and 
downregulated target genes that are responsible for different biological 
functions and metabolic patterns. In addition, some lncRNAs for 
response-associated target genes might be involved in plant defence and stress 
resistance via their MeJA- and defence-related cis-regulatory elements. 
Moreover, some MeJA-responsive lncRNA target genes were related to quinolinate 
phosphoribosyltransferase, lipoxygenases, and endopeptidase inhibitors, which 
may contribute to nicotine synthesis and disease and insect resistance, 
indicating that MeJA-responsive lncRNAs regulate nicotine biosynthesis and 
disease resistance by regulating their potential target genes in BY-2 cells. 
Therefore, our results provide more targets for genetically engineering the 
nicotine content and plant defence in tobacco plants."
1456,"Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) involves extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling of 
the aortic wall, leading to reduced biomechanical support with risk of aortic 
dissection and rupture. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and 
resultant angiotensin (Ang) II synthesis, is critically involved in the onset 
and progression of TAA. The current study investigated the effects of 
angiotensin (Ang) 1-7 on a murine model of TAA. Male 8-10-week-old ApoEKO mice 
were infused with Ang II (1.44 mg/kg/day) and treated with Ang 1-7 (0.576 
mg/kg/day). ApoEKO mice developed advanced TAA in response to four weeks of Ang 
II infusion. Echocardiographic and histological analyses demonstrated increased 
aortic dilatation, excessive structural remodelling, perivascular fibrosis, and 
inflammation in the thoracic aorta. Ang 1-7 infusion led to attenuation of 
pathological phenotypic alterations associated with Ang II-induced TAA. Smooth 
muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from adult murine thoracic aorta exhibited 
excessive mitochondrial fission, oxidative stress, and hyperproliferation in 
response to Ang II. Treatment with Ang 1-7 resulted in inhibition of 
mitochondrial fragmentation, ROS generation, and hyperproliferation. Gene 
expression profiling used for characterization of the contractile and synthetic 
phenotypes of thoracic aortic SMCs revealed preservation of the contractile 
phenotype with Ang 1-7 treatment. In conclusion, Ang 1-7 prevented Ang 
II-induced vascular remodeling and the development of TAA. Enhancing Ang 1-7 
actions may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent or delay the 
progression of TAA."
1457,"A major determinant of fruit production in longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is 
the difficulty of blossoming. In this study, high-throughput microRNA sequencing 
(miRNA-Seq) was carried out to compare differentially expressed miRNAs 
(DEmiRNAs) and their target genes between a continuous flowering cultivar 
'Sijimi' (SJ), and a unique cultivar 'Lidongben' (LD), which blossoms only once 
in the season. Over the course of our study, 1662 known miRNAs and 235 novel 
miRNAs were identified and 13,334 genes were predicted to be the target of 1868 
miRNAs. One conserved miRNA and 29 new novel miRNAs were identified as 
differently expressed; among them, 16 were upregulated and 14 were 
downregulated. Through the KEGG pathway and cluster analysis of DEmiRNA target 
genes, three critical regulatory pathways, plant-pathogen interaction, plant 
hormone signal transduction, and photosynthesis-antenna protein, were discovered 
to be strongly associated with the continuous flowering trait of the SJ. The 
integrated correlation analysis of DEmiRNAs and their target mRNAs revealed 
fourteen important flowering-related genes, including COP1-like, Casein kinase 
II, and TCP20. These fourteen flowering-related genes were targeted by five 
miRNAs, which were novel-miR137, novel-miR76, novel-miR101, novel-miR37, and 
csi-miR3954, suggesting these miRNAs might play vital regulatory roles in flower 
regulation in longan. Furthermore, novel-miR137 was cloned based on small RNA 
sequencing data analysis. The pSAK277-miR137 transgenic Arabidopsis plants 
showed delayed flowering phenotypes. This study provides new insight into 
molecular regulation mechanisms of longan flowering."
1458,"Flower bud differentiation is crucial to reproductive success in plants. In the 
present study, RNA-Seq and nutrients quantification were used to identify the 
stage-specific genes for flower bud differentiation with buds which characterize 
the marked change during flower bud formation from a widely grown Chinese cherry 
(Prunus pseudocerasus L.) cultivar 'Manaohong'. A KEGG enrichment analysis 
revealed that the sugar metabolism pathways dynamically changed. The gradually 
decreasing trend in the contents of total sugar, soluble sugar and protein 
implies that the differentiation was an energy-consuming process. Changes in the 
contents of D-glucose and sorbitol were conformed with the gene expression 
trends of bglX and SORD, respectively, which at least partially reflects a key 
role of the two substances in the transition from physiological to morphological 
differentiation. Further, the WRKY and SBP families were also significantly 
differentially expressed during the vegetative-to-reproductive transition. In 
addition, floral meristem identity genes, e.g., AP1, AP3, PI, AGL6, SEP1, LFY, 
and UFO demonstrate involvement in the specification of the petal and stamen 
primordia, and FPF1 might promote the onset of morphological differentiation. 
Conclusively, the available evidence justifies the involvement of sugar 
metabolism in the flower bud differentiation of Chinese cherry, and the 
uncovered candidate genes are beneficial to further elucidate flower bud 
differentiation in cherries."
1459,"Fungal phytopathogens are challenging to control due to their penetration into 
plant tissues. Therefore, plant-colonizing bacteria could serve as an excellent 
weapon in fighting fungal infections. In this study, we aim to determine the 
biocontrol potential of the new endophytic strain Serratia quinivorans KP32, 
isolated from the roots of Petroselinum crispum L.; identify the related 
mechanisms; and understand the basis of its antagonistic interaction with 
taxonomically diverse fungi at the molecular level. The KP32 strain presented 
biological activity against Rhizoctonia solani, Colletotrichum dematium, 
Fusarium avenaceum, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and its ability to inhibit the 
growth of the phytopathogens was found to be mediated by a broad spectrum of 
biocontrol features, such as the production of a number of lytic enzymes 
(amylases, chitinases, and proteases), siderophores, volatile organic and 
inorganic compounds, salicylic acid, and N-acyl-homoserine lactones. The higher 
expression of chitinase (chiA) and genes involved in the biosynthesis of 
hydrogen cyanide (hcnC), enterobactin (entB), and acetoin (budA) in bacteria 
exposed to fungal filtrates confirmed that these factors could act in 
combination, leading to a synergistic inhibitory effect of the strain against 
phytopathogens. We also confirm the active movement, self-aggregation, 
exopolysaccharide production, and biofilm formation abilities of the KP32 
strain, which are essential for effective plant colonization. Its biological 
activity and colonization potential indicate that KP32 holds tremendous 
potential for use as an active biopesticide and plant growth promoter."
1460,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a pulmonary vascular disease 
characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling and right heart enlargement the 
pathogenesis of PAH is complicated; no biologic-based therapy is available for 
the treatment of PAH, but recent studies suggest that inflammatory response and 
abnormal proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells are the main 
pathogenic mechanism, while the role of immune-related long non-coding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to systematically analyze 
immune-related lncRNAs in PAH. Here, we downloaded a publicly available 
microarray data from PAH and control patients (GSE113439). A total of 243 
up-regulated and 203 down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
screened, and immune-related DEGs were further obtained from ImmPort. The 
immune-related lncRNAs were obtained by co-expression analysis of immune-related 
mRNAs. Then, immune-related lncRNAs-mRNAs network including 2 lncRNAs and 6 
mRNAs was constructed which share regulatory miRNAs and have significant 
correlation. Among the lncRNA-mRNA pairs, one pair (JPX-RABEP1) was verified in 
the validating dataset GSE53408 and PAH mouse model. Furthermore, the immune 
cell infiltration analysis of the GSE113439 dataset revealed that the JPX-RABEP1 
pair may participate in the occurrence and development of PAH through immune 
cell infiltration. Together, our findings reveal that the lncRNA-mRNA pair 
JPX-RABEP1 may be a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for PAH."
1461,"Galectins are a family of ß-galactoside-binding proteins that play a variety of 
roles in normal physiology. In cancer, their expression levels are typically 
elevated and often associated with poor prognosis. They are known to fuel a 
variety of cancer progression pathways through their glycan-binding interactions 
with cancer, stromal, and immune cell surfaces. Of the 15 galectins in mammals, 
galectin (Gal)-1, -3, and -9 are particularly notable for their critical roles 
in tumor immune escape. While these galectins play integral roles in promoting 
cancer progression, they are also instrumental in regulating the survival, 
differentiation, and function of anti-tumor T cells that compromise anti-tumor 
immunity and weaken novel immunotherapies. To this end, there has been a surge 
in the development of new strategies to inhibit their pro-malignancy 
characteristics, particularly in reversing tumor immunosuppression through 
galectin-glycan ligand-targeting methods. This review examines some new 
approaches to evading Gal-1, -3, and -9-ligand interactions to interfere with 
their tumor-promoting and immunoregulating activities. Whether using 
neutralizing antibodies, synthetic peptides, glyco-metabolic modifiers, 
competitive inhibitors, vaccines, gene editing, exo-glycan modification, or 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, these methods offer new hope of 
synergizing their inhibitory effects with current immunotherapeutic methods and 
yielding highly effective, durable responses."
1462,"Food safety of staple crops such as rice is of global concern and is at the top 
of the policy agenda worldwide. Abiotic stresses are one of the main limitations 
to optimizing yields for sustainability, food security and food safety. We 
analyzed proteome changes in Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare in response to five 
adverse abiotic treatments, including three levels of drought (mild, moderate, 
and severe), soil salinization, and non-optimal temperatures. All treatments had 
modest, negative effects on plant growth, enabling us to identify proteins that 
were common to all stresses, or unique to one. More than 75% of the total of 
differentially abundant proteins in response to abiotic stresses were specific 
to individual stresses, while fewer than 5% of stress-induced proteins were 
shared across all abiotic constraints. Stress-specific and non-specific 
stress-responsive proteins identified were categorized in terms of core 
biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular localization."
1463,"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the major cause of viral encephalitis in 
humans throughout Asia. In the past twenty years, the emergence of the genotype 
I (GI) JEV as the dominant genotype in Asian countries has raised a significant 
threat to public health security. However, no clinically approved drug is 
available for the specific treatment of JEV infection, and the commercial 
vaccines derived from the genotype III JEV strains merely provided partial 
protection against the GI JEV. Thus, an easy-to-perform platform in 
high-throughput is urgently needed for the antiviral drug screening and 
assessment of neutralizing antibodies specific against the GI JEV. In this 
study, we established a reverse genetics system for the GI JEV strain (YZ-1) 
using a homologous recombination strategy. Using this reverse genetic system, a 
gaussia luciferase (Gluc) expression cassette was inserted into the JEV genome 
to generate a reporter virus (rGI-Gluc). The reporter virus exhibited similar 
growth kinetics to the parental virus and remained genetically stable for at 
least ten passages in vitro. Of note, the bioluminescence signal strength of 
Gluc in the culture supernatants was well correlated with the viral progenies 
determined by viral titration. Taking advantage of this reporter virus, we 
established Gluc readout-based assays for antiviral drug screening and 
neutralizing antibody detection against the GI JEV. These Gluc readout-based 
assays exhibited comparable performance to the assays using an actual virus and 
are less time consuming and are applicable for a high-throughput format. Taken 
together, we generated a GI JEV reporter virus expressing a Gluc gene that could 
be a valuable tool for an antiviral drug screening assay and neutralization 
assay."
1464,"Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) is a lysosomal enzyme essential for the degradation 
of cholesteryl esters through the endocytic pathway. Deficiency of the LAL 
enzyme encoded by the LIPA gene leads to LAL deficiency (LAL-D) (OMIM 278000), 
one of the lysosomal storage disorders involving 50-60 genes. Among the two 
disease subtypes, the severe disease subtype of LAL-D is known as Wolman 
disease, with typical manifestations involving hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, 
vomiting, diarrhea, and hematopoietic abnormalities, such as anemia. In 
contrast, the mild disease subtype of this disorder is known as cholesteryl 
ester storage disease, with hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and 
high-density lipoprotein disappearance. The prevalence of LAL-D is rare, but 
several treatment options, including enzyme replacement therapy, are available. 
Accordingly, a number of screening methodologies have been developed for this 
disorder. This review summarizes the current discussion on LAL-D, covering 
genetics, screening, and the tertiary structure of human LAL enzyme and 
preclinical study for the future development of a novel therapy."
1465,"The occurrence of the honeybee caste polyphenism arises when a change in diet is 
transduced into cellular metabolic responses, resulting in a developmental shift 
mediated by gene expression. The aim of this investigation was to detect and 
describe the expression profile of water-soluble proteases during the 
ontogenesis of honeybee worker-fate larvae. The extraction of insect homogenates 
was followed by the electrophoretic separation of the protein extract in 
polyacrylamide gels under semi-denaturing condition, precast with gelatin, 
pollen, or royal jelly protein extracts. The worker-fate honeybee larva showed a 
proteolytic pattern that varied with aging, and a protease with the highest 
activity at 72 h after hatching was named PS4. PS4 has a molecular weight of 45 
kDa, it remained active until cell sealing, and its enzymatic properties suggest 
a serine-proteinase nature. To define the process that originates a queen-fate 
larvae, royal jelly and pollen were analysed, but PS4 was not detected in either 
of them. The effect of food on the PS4 was investigated by mixing crude extracts 
of queen and worker-fate larvae with pollen and royal jelly, respectively. Only 
royal jelly inhibited PS4 in worker-fate larvae. Taken together, our data 
suggest that PS4 could be involved in caste differentiation."
1466,"This study aimed to explore the spatio-temporal expression patterns of 
congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) candidate genes, 
Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1), Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 
(FGFR2) and Receptor-Interacting Protein Kinase 5 (RIP5), in human fetal kidney 
development (CTRL) and kidneys affected with CAKUT. Human fetal kidneys from the 
22nd to 41st developmental week (duplex, hypoplastic, dysplastic, and controls) 
were stained with antibodies and analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy and 
RT-qPCR. The effect of CAKUT candidate genes on kidney nephrogenesis and 
function is confirmed by statistically significant variations in the 
spatio-temporal expression patterns of the investigated markers. The nuclear 
localization of FGFR1, elevated expression score of FGFR1 mRNA, the increased 
area percentage of FGFR1-positive cells in the kidney cortex, and the overall 
decrease in the expression after the peak at the 27th developmental week in 
dysplastic kidneys (DYS), suggest an altered expression pattern and protein 
function in response to CAKUT pathophysiology. The RT-qPCR analysis revealed a 
significantly higher FGFR2 mRNA expression score in the CAKUT kidneys compared 
to the CTRL. This increase could be due to the repair mechanism involving the 
downstream mediator, Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). The 
expression of RIP5 during normal human kidney development was reduced 
temporarily, due to urine production and increased later since it undertakes 
additional functions in the maturation of the postnatal kidney and homeostasis, 
while the expression dynamics in CAKUT-affected kidneys exhibited a decrease in 
the percentage of RIP5-positive cells during the investigated developmental 
period. Our findings highlight the importance of FGFR1, FGFR2, and RIP5 as 
markers in normal and pathological kidney development."
1467,"Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy has proven to be 
effective in lung cancer treatment, it may not be sufficient to fully activate 
the antitumor immune response. Here, we investigated whether entinostat, a 
histone deacetylase inhibitor, could improve the efficacy of radiotherapy and 
anti-PD-1 in a murine syngeneic LL/2 tumor model. A total of 12 Gy of X-rays 
administered in two fractions significantly delayed tumor growth in mice, which 
was further enhanced by oral entinostat administration. Flow cytometry-aided 
immune cell profiling revealed that entinostat increased radiation-induced 
infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and CD8+ T cells with decreased 
regulatory T-cells (Tregs). Transcriptomics-based immune phenotype prediction 
showed that entinostat potentiated radiation-activated pathways, such as 
JAK/STAT3/interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and PD-1/PD-L1 signaling. Entinostat 
augmented the antitumor efficacy of radiation and anti-PD-1, which may be 
related to an increase in IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T-cells with a decrease in Treg 
cells. Comparative transcriptomic profiling predicted that entinostat increased 
the number of dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells in tumors treated with 
radiation and anti-PD-1 by inducing MHC-II genes. In conclusion, our findings 
provided insights into how entinostat improves the efficacy of ionizing 
radiation plus anti-PD-1 therapy and offered clues for developing new strategies 
for clinical trials."
1468,"Ros/MucR is a widespread family of bacterial zinc-finger-containing proteins 
that integrate multiple functions, such as symbiosis, virulence, transcription 
regulation, motility, production of surface components, and various other 
physiological processes in cells. This regulatory protein family is conserved in 
bacteria and is characterized by its zinc-finger motif, which has been proposed 
as the ancestral domain from which the eukaryotic C2H2 zinc-finger structure has 
evolved. The first prokaryotic zinc-finger domain found in the transcription 
regulator Ros was identified in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In the past decades, 
a large body of evidence revealed Ros/MucR as pleiotropic transcriptional 
regulators that mainly act as repressors through oligomerization and binding to 
AT-rich target promoters. The N-terminal domain and the zinc-finger-bearing 
C-terminal region of these regulatory proteins are engaged in oligomerization 
and DNA binding, respectively. These properties of the Ros/MucR proteins are 
similar to those of xenogeneic silencers, such as H-NS, MvaT, and Lsr2, which 
are mainly found in other lineages. In fact, a novel functional model recently 
proposed for this protein family suggests that they act as H-NS-'like' gene 
silencers. The prokaryotic zinc-finger domain exhibits interesting structural 
and functional features that are different from that of its eukaryotic 
counterpart (a βββα topology), as it folds in a significantly larger 
zinc-binding globular domain (a βββαα topology). Phylogenetic analysis of 
Ros/MucR homologs suggests an ancestral origin of this type of protein in 
α-Proteobacteria. Furthermore, multiple duplications and lateral gene transfer 
events contributing to the diversity and phyletic distribution of these 
regulatory proteins were found in bacterial genomes."
1469,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) is an important member of 
extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC). It shares similar 
pathogenic strategies with neonatal meningitis E. coli (NMEC) and may threaten 
human health due to its potential zoonosis. RyhB is a small non-coding RNA that 
regulates iron homeostasis in E. coli. However, it is unclear whether RyhB 
regulates meningitis occurrence. To investigate the function of RyhB in the 
development of meningitis, we constructed the deletion mutant APEC XM∆ryhB and 
the complemented mutant APEC XM∆ryhB/pryhB, established a mouse meningitis model 
and evaluated the role of RyhB in virulence of APEC. The results showed that the 
deletion of ryhB decreased biofilm formation, adhesion to the brain 
microvascular endothelial cell line bEnd.3 and serum resistance. RNA-seq data 
showed that the expression of multiple virulence-related genes changed in the 
ryhB deletion mutant in the presence of duck serum. Deletion of ryhB reduced the 
clinical symptoms of mice, such as opisthotonus, diarrhea and neurological 
signs, when challenged with APEC. Compared with the mice infected with the 
wild-type APEC, fewer histopathological lesions were observed in the brain of 
mice infected with the ryhB deletion mutant APEC XM∆ryhB. The bacterial loads in 
the tissues and the relative expression of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in 
the brain significantly decreased when challenged with the APEC XM∆ryhB. The 
expressions of tight junction proteins (claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1) were not 
reduced in the brain of mice infected with APEC XM∆ryhB; that is, the 
blood-brain barrier permeability of mice was not significantly damaged. In 
conclusion, RyhB contributes to the pathogenicity of APEC XM in the 
meningitis-causing process by promoting biofilm formation, adhesion to 
endothelial cells, serum resistance and virulence-related genes expression."
1470,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Microbiome has been shown to affect tumorigenesis by 
promoting inflammation. However, the association between the upper aerodigestive 
microbiome and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is not well 
established. Hypoxia is a modifiable factor associated with poor radiation 
response. Our study analyzed the HNSCC tumor samples from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) to investigate the relationship between different HNSCC tumor 
subsites, hypoxia, and local tumor microbiome composition.
RESULTS: A total of 357 patients were included [Oral cavity (OC) = 226, 
Oropharynx (OPx) = 53, and Larynx/Hypopharynx (LHPx) = 78], of which 12.8%, 
71.7%, and 10.3%, respectively, were HPV positive. The mean (SD) hypoxia scores 
were 30.18 (11.10), 24.31 (14.13), and 29.53 (12.61) in OC, OPx, and LHPx 
tumors, respectively, with higher values indicating greater hypoxia. The hypoxia 
score was significantly higher for OC tumors compared to OPx (p = 0.044) and 
LHPx (p = 0.002). There was no significant correlation between hypoxia and HPV 
status. Pseudomonas sp. in OC, Actinomyces sp. and Sulfurimonas sp. in OPx, and 
Filifactor, Pseudomonas and Actinomyces sp. in LHPx had the strongest 
association with the hypoxia score.
MATERIALS/METHODS: Tumor RNAseq samples from TCGA were processed, and the R 
package ""tmesig"" was used to calculate gene expression signature, including the 
Buffa hypoxia (BH) score, a validated hypoxia signature using 52 
hypoxia-regulated genes. Microbe relative abundances were modeled with primary 
tumor location and a high vs. low tertile BH score applying a gamma-distributed 
generalized linear regression using the ""stats"" package in R, with adjusted 
p-value &lt; 0.05 considered significant.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, oral cavity tumors were found to be more hypoxic 
compared to other head and neck subsites, which could potentially contribute to 
their radiation resistance. For each subsite, distinct microbial populations 
were over-represented in hypoxic tumors in a subsite-specific manner. Further 
studies focusing on an association between microbiome, hypoxia, and patient 
outcomes are warranted."
1471,"Osteoarthritis of the equine distal interphalangeal joint is a common cause of 
lameness. MicroRNAs from biofluids are promising biomarkers and therapeutic 
candidates. Synovial fluid samples from horses with mild and severe equine 
distal interphalangeal joint osteoarthritis were submitted for small RNA 
sequencing. The results demonstrated that miR-92a was downregulated in equine 
synovial fluid from horses with severe osteoarthritis and there was a 
significant increase in COMP, COL1A2, RUNX2 and SOX9 following miR-92a mimic 
treatment of equine chondrocytes in monolayer culture. This is the first equine 
study to evaluate the role of miR-92a in osteoarthritic chondrocytes in vitro."
1472,"Heme is of great significance in food nutrition and food coloring, and the 
successful launch of artificial meat has greatly improved the application of 
heme in meat products. The precursor of heme, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), has a 
wide range of applications in the agricultural and medical fields, including in 
the treatment of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, E. coli 
recombinants capable of heme production were developed by metabolic engineering 
and membrane engineering. Firstly, by optimizing the key genes of the heme 
synthesis pathway and the screening of hosts and plasmids, the recombinant 
strain EJM-pCD-AL produced 4.34 ± 0.02 mg/L heme. Then, the transport genes of 
heme precursors CysG, hemX and CyoE were knocked out, and the extracellular 
transport pathways of heme Dpp and Ccm were strengthened, obtaining the strain 
EJM-ΔCyoE-pCD-AL that produced 9.43 ± 0.03 mg/L heme. Finally, fed-batch 
fermentation was performed in a 3-L fermenter and reached 28.20 ± 0.77 mg/L heme 
and 303 ± 1.21 mg/L ALA. This study indicates that E. coli recombinant strains 
show a promising future in the field of heme and ALA production."
1473,"LMNA-related muscular dystrophy is an autosomal-dominant progressive disorder 
caused by mutations in LMNA. LMNA missense mutations are becoming correctable 
with CRISPR/Cas9-derived tools. Evaluating the functional recovery of LMNA after 
gene editing bears challenges as there is no reported direct loss of function of 
lamin A/C proteins in patient-derived cells. The proteins encoded by LMNA are 
lamins A/C, important ubiquitous nuclear envelope proteins but absent in 
pluripotent stem cells. We induced lamin A/C expression in induced pluripotent 
stem cells (iPSCs) of two patients with LMNA-related muscular dystrophy, 
NM_170707.4 (LMNA): c.1366A &gt; G, p.(Asn456Asp) and c.1494G &gt; T, 
p.(Trp498Cys), using a short three-day, serum-induced differentiation protocol 
and analyzed expression profiles of co-regulated genes, examples being COL1A2 
and S100A6. We then performed precise gene editing of LMNA c.1366A &gt; G using 
the near-PAMless (PAM: protospacer-adjacent motif) cytosine base editor. We show 
that the mutation can be repaired to 100% efficiency in individual iPSC clones. 
The fast differentiation protocol provided a functional readout and demonstrated 
increased lamin A/C expression as well as normalized expression of co-regulated 
genes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the power of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated 
gene correction and effective outcome measures in a disease with, so far, little 
perspective on therapies."
1474,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain a substantial global health problem and the 
leading cause of death worldwide. Although many conventional small-molecule 
treatments are available to support the cardiac function of the patient with 
CVD, they are not effective as a cure. Among potential targets for gene therapy 
are severe cardiac and peripheral ischemia, heart failure, vein graft failure, 
and some forms of dyslipidemias. In the last three decades, multiple gene 
therapy tools have been used for heart diseases caused by proteins, plasmids, 
adenovirus, and adeno-associated viruses (AAV), but these remain as unmet 
clinical needs. These gene therapy methods are ineffective due to poor and 
uncontrolled gene expression, low stability, immunogenicity, and transfection 
efficiency. The synthetic modified mRNA (modRNA) presents a novel gene therapy 
approach which provides a transient, stable, safe, non-immunogenic, controlled 
mRNA delivery to the heart tissue without any risk of genomic integration, and 
achieves a therapeutic effect in different organs, including the heart. The mRNA 
translation starts in minutes, and remains stable for 8-10 days (pulse-like 
kinetics). The pulse-like expression of modRNA in the heart induces cardiac 
repair, cardiomyocyte proliferation and survival, and inhibits cardiomyocyte 
apoptosis post-myocardial infarction (MI). Cell-specific (cardiomyocyte) modRNA 
translation developments established cell-specific modRNA therapeutics for heart 
diseases. With these laudable characteristics, combined with its expression 
kinetics in the heart, modRNA has become an attractive therapeutic for the 
treatment of CVD. This review discusses new developments in modRNA therapy for 
heart diseases."
1475,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with distinct clinical and molecular 
characteristics. Scientific advances in molecular subtype differentiation 
support the understanding of cellular signaling, crosstalk, proliferation, 
survival, migration, and invasion mechanisms, allowing the development of new 
molecular drug targets. The breast cancer subtype with super expression and/or 
amplification of human growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is clinically aggressive, 
but prognosis significantly shifted with the advent of anti-HER2 targeted 
therapy. Zoledronic-acid (ZOL) combined with a neoadjuvant 
Trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy regimen (Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide 
followed by Docetaxel, Trastuzumab) increased the pCR rate in a RH-positive/ 
HER2-positive subgroup, according to the phase II Zo-NAnTax trial. To verify 
genes that could be related to this response, a microarray assay was performed 
finding 164 differentially expressed genes. Silico analysis of these genes 
showed signaling pathways related to growth factors, apoptosis, invasion, and 
metabolism, as well as differentially expressed genes related to estrogen 
response. In addition, the RAC3 gene was found to interact with the MVD gene, a 
member of the mevalonate pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that 
RH-positive/ HER2-positive patients present gene alterations before treatment, 
and these could be related to the improvement of pCR."
1476,"Rickettsia are obligate intracellular bacteria primarily carried by arthropod 
hosts. The genus Rickettsia contains several vertebrate pathogens vectored by 
hematophagous arthropods. Despite the potential for disease, our understanding 
of Rickettsias are limited by the difficulties associated with growing and 
manipulating obligate intracellular bacteria. To aid with this, our lab 
conducted an analysis of eight genomes and three plasmids from across the genus 
Rickettsia. Using OPT4e, a learning algorithm-based program designed to identify 
effector proteins secreted by the type 4 secretion system, we generated a 
putative effectome for the genus. We then consolidated effectors into homolog 
sets to identify effectors unique to Rickettsia with different life strategies 
or evolutionary histories. We also compared predicted effectors to non-effectors 
for differences in G+C content and gene splitting. Based on this analysis, we 
predicted 1571 effectors across the genus, resulting in 604 homolog sets. Each 
species had unique homolog sets, while 42 were present in all eight species 
analyzed. Effectors were flagged in association with pathogenic, tick and 
flea-borne Rickettsia. Predicted effectors also varied in G+C content and 
frequency of gene splitting as compared to non-effectors. Species effector 
repertoires show signs of expansion, degradation, and horizontal acquisition 
associated with lifestyle and lineage."
1477,"Senescence represents a unique cellular stress response characterized by a 
stable growth arrest, macromolecular alterations, and wide spectrum changes in 
gene expression. Classically, senescence is the end-product of progressive 
telomeric attrition resulting from the repetitive division of somatic cells. In 
addition, senescent cells accumulate in premalignant lesions, in part, as a 
product of oncogene hyperactivation, reflecting one element of the tumor 
suppressive function of senescence. Oncogenic processes that induce senescence 
include overexpression/hyperactivation of H-Ras, B-Raf, and cyclin E as well as 
inactivation of PTEN. Oncogenic viruses, such as Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), 
have also been shown to induce senescence. High-risk strains of HPV drive the 
immortalization, and hence transformation, of cervical epithelial cells via 
several mechanisms, but primarily via deregulation of the cell cycle, and 
possibly, by facilitating escape from senescence. Despite the wide and 
successful utilization of HPV vaccines in reducing the incidence of cervical 
cancer, this measure is not effective in preventing cancer development in 
individuals already positive for HPV. Accordingly, in this commentary, we focus 
on the potential contribution of oncogene and HPV-induced senescence (OIS) in 
cervical cancer. We further consider the potential utility of senolytic agents 
for the elimination of HPV-harboring senescent cells as a strategy for reducing 
HPV-driven transformation and the risk of cervical cancer development."
1478,"Previous in vitro studies have shown that the intestinal luminal content, 
including metabolites, possibly regulates epithelial layer responses to harmful 
stimuli and promotes disease. Therefore, we aimed to test the hypothesis that 
fecal supernatants from patients with colon cancer (CC), ulcerative colitis (UC) 
and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) contain distinct metabolite profiles and 
establish their effects on Caco-2 cells and human-derived colon organoids 
(colonoids). The metabolite profiles of fecal supernatants were analyzed by 
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and distinguished patients with CC (n = 
6), UC (n = 6), IBS (n = 6) and healthy subjects (n = 6). Caco-2 monolayers and 
human apical-out colonoids underwent stimulation with fecal supernatants from 
different patient groups and healthy subjects. Their addition did not impair 
monolayer integrity, as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance; 
however, fecal supernatants from different patient groups and healthy subjects 
altered the gene expression of Caco-2 monolayers, as well as colonoid cultures. 
In conclusion, the stimulation of Caco-2 cells and colonoids with fecal 
supernatants derived from CC, UC and IBS patients altered gene expression 
profiles, potentially reflecting the luminal microenvironment of the fecal 
sample donor. This experimental approach allows for investigating the crosstalk 
at the gut barrier and the effects of the gut microenvironment in the 
pathogenesis of intestinal diseases."
1479,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant within eukaryotic messenger RNA 
modification, which plays an essential regulatory role in the control of 
cellular functions and gene expression. However, it remains an outstanding 
challenge to detect mRNA m6A transcriptome-wide at base resolution via 
experimental approaches, which are generally time-consuming and expensive. 
Developing computational methods is a good strategy for accurate in silico 
detection of m6A modification sites from the large amount of RNA sequence data. 
Unfortunately, the existing computational models are usually only for m6A site 
prediction in a single species, without considering the tissue level of species, 
while most of them are constructed based on low-confidence level data generated 
by an m6A antibody immunoprecipitation (IP)-based sequencing method, thereby 
restricting reliability and generalizability of proposed models. Here, we review 
recent advances in computational prediction of m6A sites and construct a new 
computational approach named im6APred using ensemble deep learning to accurately 
identify m6A sites based on high-confidence level data in multiple tissues of 
mammals. Our model im6APred builds upon a comprehensive evaluation of multiple 
classification methods, including four traditional classification algorithms and 
three deep learning methods and their ensembles. The optimal base-classifier 
combinations are then chosen by five-fold cross-validation test to achieve an 
effective stacked model. Our model im6APred can produce the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) in the range of 0.82-0.91 on 
independent tests, indicating that our model has the ability to learn general 
methylation rules on RNA bases and generalize to m6A transcriptome-wide 
identification. Moreover, AUROCs in the range of 0.77-0.96 were achieved using 
cross-species/tissues validation on the benchmark dataset, demonstrating 
differences in predictive performance at the tissue level and the need for 
constructing tissue-specific models for m6A site prediction."
1480,"The Orthodontic Tooth Movement (OTM) is allowed through a mediated cell/tissue 
mechanism performed by applying a force or a pair of forces on the dental 
elements, and the tooth movement is a fundamental requirement during any 
orthodontic treatment. In this regard, it has been widely shown that each 
orthodontic treatment has a minimum duration required concerning numerous 
factors (age, patient compliance, type of technique used, etc.). In this regard, 
the aim of the following revision of the literature is to give readers a global 
vision of principal microRNAs (miRNAs) that are most frequently associated with 
OTM and their possible roles. Previously published studies of the last 15 years 
have been considered in the PubMed search using ""OTM"" and ""miRNA"" keywords for 
the present review article. In vitro and in vivo studies and clinical trials 
were mainly explored. Correlation between OTM and modulation of several miRNAs 
acting through post-transcriptional regulation on target genes was observed in 
the majority of previous studied. The expression analysis of miRNAs in 
biological samples, such as gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), can be considered a 
useful tool for novel diagnostic and/or prognostic approaches and for new 
personalized orthodontic treatments able to achieve a better clinical response 
rate. Although only a few studies have been published, the data obtained until 
now encourage further investigation of the role of miRNA modulation during 
orthodontic treatment. The aim of this study is to update the insights into the 
role and impact of principal micro-RNAs (miRNAs) that are most frequently 
associated during OTM."
1481,"Sugarcane brown stripe (SBS), caused by the fungal pathogen Helminthosporium 
stenospilum, is one of the most serious threats to sugarcane production. 
However, its outbreaks and epidemics require suitable climatic conditions, 
resulting in the inefficient improvement of the SBS resistance by phenotype 
selection. The sugarcane F1 population of SBS-resistant YT93-159 × 
SBS-susceptible ROC22 was used for constructing the bulks. Bulked segregant 
RNA-seq (BSR-seq) was then performed on the parents YT93-159 (T01) and ROC22 
(T02), and the opposite bulks of 30 SBS-susceptible individuals mixed bulk (T03) 
and 30 SBS-resistant individuals mixed bulk (T04) collected from 287 F1 
individuals. A total of 170.00 Gb of clean data containing 297,921 SNPs and 
70,426 genes were obtained. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis 
suggested that 7787 and 5911 DEGs were identified in the parents (T01 vs. T02) 
and two mixed bulks (T03 vs. T04), respectively. In addition, 25,363 
high-quality and credible SNPs were obtained using the genome analysis toolkit 
GATK for SNP calling. Subsequently, six candidate regions with a total length of 
8.72 Mb, which were located in the chromosomes 4B and 7C of sugarcane wild 
species Saccharum spontaneum, were identified, and 279 genes associated with 
SBS-resistance were annotated by ED algorithm and ΔSNP-index. Furthermore, the 
expression profiles of candidate genes were verified by quantitative real-time 
PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, and the results showed that eight genes (LRR-RLK, DHAR1, 
WRKY7, RLK1, BLH4, AK3, CRK34, and NDA2) and seven genes (WRKY31, CIPK2, CKA1, 
CDPK6, PFK4, CBL2, and PR2) of the 20 tested genes were significantly 
up-regulated in YT93-159 and ROC22, respectively. Finally, a potential molecular 
mechanism of sugarcane response to H. stenospilum infection is illustrate that 
the activations of ROS signaling, MAPK cascade signaling, Ca2+ signaling, ABA 
signaling, and the ASA-GSH cycle jointly promote the SBS resistance in 
sugarcane. This study provides abundant gene resources for the SBS resistance 
breeding in sugarcane."
1482,"The vital tissue homeostasis regulator p53 forms a tetramer when it binds to DNA 
and regulates the genes that mediate essential biological processes such as 
cell-cycle arrest, senescence, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Missense mutations in 
the core DNA-binding domain (109-292) simultaneously cause the loss of p53 tumor 
suppressor function and accumulation of the mutant p53 proteins that are 
carcinogenic. The most common p53 hotspot mutation at codon 248 in the 
DNA-binding region, where arginine (R) is substituted by tryptophan (W), glycine 
(G), leucine (L), proline (P), and glutamine (Q), is reported in various 
cancers. However, it is unclear how the p53 Arg248 mutation with distinct amino 
acid substitution affects the structure, function, and DNA binding affinity. 
Here, we characterized the pathogenicity and protein stability of p53 hotspot 
mutations at codon 248 using computational tools PredictSNP, Align GVGD, HOPE, 
ConSurf, and iStable. We found R248W, R248G, and R248P mutations highly 
deleterious and destabilizing. Further, we subjected all five R248 
mutant-p53-DNA and wt-p53-DNA complexes to molecular dynamics simulation to 
investigate the structural stability and DNA binding affinity. From the MD 
simulation analysis, we observed increased RMSD, RMSF, and Rg values and 
decreased protein-DNA intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the R248-p53-DNA than the 
wt-p53-DNA complexes. Likewise, due to high SASA values, we observed the 
shrinkage of proteins in R248W, R248G, and R248P mutant-p53-DNA complexes. 
Compared to other mutant p53-DNA complexes, the R248W, R248G, and R248P 
mutant-p53-DNA complexes showed more structural alteration. MM-PBSA analysis 
showed decreased binding energies with DNA in all five R248-p53-DNA mutants than 
the wt-p53-DNA complexes. Henceforth, we conclude that the amino acid 
substitution of Arginine with the other five amino acids at codon 248 reduces 
the p53 protein's affinity for DNA and may disrupt cell division, resulting in a 
gain of p53 function. The proposed study influences the development of 
rationally designed molecular-targeted treatments that improve p53-based 
therapeutic outcomes in cancer."
1483,"The effect of single substitutions of protium for deuterium in hydrogen bonds 
between pairs of nitrogenous bases on the open states occurrence probability at 
high critical breaking energies of these bonds has been studied. The study was 
carried out using numerical methods based on the angular mathematical model of 
DNA. The IFNA17 gene was divided into three approximately equal parts. A 
comparison of the open states occurrence probability in these parts of the gene 
was done. To improve the accuracy of the results, a special data processing 
algorithm was developed. The developed methods have shown their suitability for 
taking into account the occurrence of open states in the entire range of high 
critical energies. It has been established that single 2H/1H substitutions in 
certain nitrogenous bases can be a mechanism for maintaining the vital activity 
of IFNA17 under critical conditions. In general, the developed method of the 
mathematical modeling provide unprecedented insight into the DNA behavior under 
the highest critical energy range, which greatly expands scientific 
understanding of nucleobases interaction."
1484,"The phenomenon of internal initiation of translation was discovered in 1988 on 
poliovirus mRNA. The prototypic cis-acting element in the 5' untranslated region 
(5'UTR) of poliovirus mRNA, which is able to direct initiation at an internal 
start codon without the involvement of a cap structure, has been called an IRES 
(Internal Ribosome Entry Site or Segment). Despite its early discovery, 
poliovirus and other related IRES elements of type I are poorly characterized, 
and it is not yet clear which host proteins (a.k.a. IRES trans-acting factors, 
ITAFs) are required for their full activity in vivo. Here we discuss recent and 
old results devoted to type I IRESes and provide evidence that Poly(rC) binding 
protein 2 (PCBP2), Glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS), and Cold Shock Domain 
Containing E1 (CSDE1, also known as UNR) are major regulators of type I IRES 
activity."
1485,"Germ cells are pivotal for gonadal sexuality maintenance and reproduction. Sex 
lethal (sxl), the somatic sex determining gene of Drosophila, is the known 
regulator and initiator of germ cell femininity in invertebrates. However, the 
role of the Sxl homologue has rarely been investigated in vertebrates. So, we 
used medaka to clarify the role of sxl in vertebrate gonadogenesis and sexuality 
and identified two Sxl homologues, i.e., Sxl1a and Sxl1b. We found that sxl1a 
specifically expresses in the primordial germ cells (PGC), ovary, (early gonia 
and oocytes), while sxl1b distributions are ubiquitous. An mRNA overexpression 
of sxl1a accelerated germ cell numbers in 10 DAH XY fish, and sxl1a knockdown 
(KD), on the other hand, induced PGC mis-migration, aberrant PGC structuring and 
ultimately caused significant germ cell reduction in XX fish. Using an in vitro 
promoter analysis and in vivo steroid treatment, we found a strong link between 
sxl1a and estrogenic germ cell-population maintenance. Further, using sxl1a-KD 
and erβ2-knockout fish, we determined that sxl1 acts through erβ2 and controls 
PGC sexuality. Cumulatively, our study highlights the novel role of sxl1a in 
germ cell maintenance and sexual identity assignment and thus might become a 
steppingstone to understanding the commonalities of animal sexual development."
1486,"Kaiso is a methyl-DNA-binding protein containing three C2H2 zinc fingers with a 
C-terminal extension that participates in DNA binding. The linker between the 
last zinc finger and the DNA-binding portion of the extension contains two 
prolines that are highly conserved in vertebrates and in cognate ZBTB4 and 
ZBTB38 proteins. Prolines provide chain rigidity and can exist in cis and trans 
conformations that can be switched by proline isomerases, affecting protein 
function. We found that substitution of the conserved proline P588, but not of 
P577, to alanine, negatively affected KaisoDNA-binding according to molecular 
dynamics simulation and in vitro DNA-binding assays. Molecular dynamics 
simulations of the Kaiso DNA-binding domain with P588 either substituted to 
alanine or switched to the cis-conformation revealed similar alterations in the 
H-bonding network and uncovered allosteric effects leading to structural 
rearrangements in the entire domain that resulted in the weakening of 
DNA-binding affinity. The substitution of proline with a large hydrophobic 
residue led to the same negative effects despite its ability to partially rescue 
the intrinsic DNA-binding activity of the C-terminal loop. Thus, the presence of 
the C-terminal extension and cis-conformation of proline residues are essential 
for efficient Kaiso-DNA binding, which likely involves intramolecular tension 
squeezing the DNA chain."
1487,"Compared to transcription initiation, much less is known about transcription 
termination. In particular, large-scale mutagenesis studies have, so far, 
primarily concentrated on promoter and enhancer, but not terminator sequences. 
Here, we used a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to systematically 
analyze the influence of short (8 bp) sequence variants (mutations) located 
downstream of the polyadenylation signal (PAS) on the steady-state mRNA level of 
the upstream gene, employing an eGFP reporter and human HEK293T cells as a model 
system. In total, we evaluated 227,755 mutations located at different 
overlapping positions within +17..+56 bp downstream of the PAS for their ability 
to regulate the reporter gene expression. We found that the positions +17..+44 
bp downstream of the PAS are more essential for gene upregulation than those 
located more distal to the PAS, and that the mutation sequences ensuring high 
levels of eGFP mRNA expression are extremely T-rich. Next, we validated the 
positive effect of a couple of mutations identified in the MPRA screening on the 
eGFP and luciferase protein expression. The most promising mutation increased 
the expression of the reporter proteins 13-fold and sevenfold on average in 
HEK293T and CHO cells, respectively. Overall, these findings might be useful for 
further improving the efficiency of production of therapeutic products, e.g., 
recombinant antibodies."
1488,"sRNAs have an important role in the regulation of bacterial gene expression. The 
sRNA, UdsC, of Rhodobacter sphaeroides is derived from the 3' UTR of the 
RSP_7527 mRNA, which encodes a hypothetical protein. Here, we showed the effect 
of UdsC on the resistance of Rhodobacter sphaeroides to hydrogen peroxide and on 
its motility. In vitro binding assays supported the direct interaction of UdsC 
with the 5' UTR of the rpoHII mRNA. RpoHII is an alternative sigma factor with 
an important role in stress responses in R. sphaeroides, including its response 
to hydrogen peroxide. We also demonstrated that RpoHII controls the expression 
of the torF gene, which encodes an important regulator of motility genes. This 
strongly suggested that the observed effect of UdsC on TorF expression is 
indirect and mediated by RpoHII."
1489,"Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is an annual herb from the Scutellaria genus that 
has been extensively used as a traditional medicine for over 2000 years in 
China. Baicalin and other flavonoids have been identified as the principal 
bioactive ingredients. The biosynthetic pathway of baicalin in S. baicalensis 
has been elucidated; however, the specific functions of R2R3-MYB TF, which 
regulates baicalin synthesis, has not been well characterized in S. baicalensis 
to date. Here, a S20 R2R3-MYB TF (SbMYB12), which encodes 263 amino acids with a 
length of 792 bp, was expressed in all tested tissues (mainly in leaves) and 
responded to exogenous hormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. The 
overexpression of SbMYB12 significantly promoted the accumulation of flavonoids 
such as baicalin and wogonoside in S. baicalensis hairy roots. Furthermore, 
biochemical experiments revealed that SbMYB12 is a nuclear-localized 
transcription activator that binds to the SbCCL7-4, SbCHI-2, and SbF6H-1 
promoters to activate their expression. These results illustrate that SbMYB12 
positively regulates the generation of baicalin and wogonoside. In summary, this 
work revealed a novel S20 R2R3-MYB regulator and enhances our understanding of 
the transcriptional and regulatory mechanisms of baicalin biosynthesis, as well 
as sheds new light on metabolic engineering in S. baicalensis."
1490,"Inflammation is a biological response of the immune system to various insults, 
such as pathogens, toxic compounds, damaged cells, and radiation. The complex 
network of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors and their direction towards 
inflammation often leads to the development and progression of various 
inflammation-associated diseases. The role of small non-coding RNAs (small 
ncRNAs) in inflammation has gained much attention in the past two decades for 
their regulation of inflammatory gene expression at multiple levels and their 
potential to serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in various diseases. 
One group of small ncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), has become a key regulator in 
various inflammatory disease conditions. Their fine-tuning of target gene 
regulation often turns out to be an important factor in controlling aberrant 
inflammatory reactions in the system. This review summarizes the biogenesis of 
miRNA and the mechanisms of miRNA-mediated gene regulation. The review also 
briefly discusses various pro- and anti-inflammatory miRNAs, their targets and 
functions, and provides a detailed discussion on the role of miR-10a in 
inflammation."
1491,"Ever-increasing consumer demand for sea cucumbers mainly leads to huge damage to 
wild sea cucumber resources, including Stichopus monotuberculatus, which in turn 
exerts negative impacts on marine environments due to the lack of ecological 
functions performed by sea cucumbers. Aquaculture of sea cucumbers is an 
effective way to meet consumer demand and restore their resources. Unsynchronous 
growth is a prominent problem in the aquaculture of sea cucumbers which has 
concealed unelucidated molecular mechanisms until now. In this study, we carried 
out an integrative analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics on fast-growing 
(SMF) and slow-growing (SMS) groups of S. monotuberculatus cultured in the same 
environmental conditions. The results revealed that a total of 2054 
significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, which are 
mainly involved in fat digestion and absorption, histidine metabolism, 
arachidonic acid metabolism, and glutathione metabolism. 368 differential 
metabolites (DMs) were screened out between the SMF group and the SMS group; 
these metabolites are mainly involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism, purine 
metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, pyrimidine metabolism, 
arachidonic acid metabolism, and other metabolic pathways. The integrative 
analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics of S. monotuberculatus suggested 
that the SMF group had a higher capacity for lipid metabolism and protein 
synthesis, and had a more frequent occurrence of apoptosis events, which are 
likely to be related to coping with environmental stresses. The results of this 
study provide potential values for the aquaculture of sea cucumbers which may 
promote their resource enhancement."
1492,"Staphylococcus pettenkoferi is a recently described coagulase-negative 
Staphylococcus identified in human diseases, especially in infections of foot 
ulcers in patients living with diabetes mellitus. To date, its pathogenicity 
remains underexplored. In this study, whole-genome analysis was performed on a 
collection of 29 S. pettenkoferi clinical strains isolated from bloodstream and 
diabetic foot infections with regard to their phylogenetic relationships and 
comprehensive analysis of their resistome and virulome. Their virulence was 
explored by their ability to form biofilm, their growth kinetics and in an in 
vivo zebrafish embryo infection model. Our results identified two distinct 
clades (I and II) and two subclades (I-a and I-b) with notable genomic 
differences. All strains had a slow bacterial growth. Three profiles of biofilm 
formation were noted, with 89.7% of isolates able to produce biofilm and 
harbouring a high content of biofilm-encoding genes. Two virulence profiles were 
also observed in the zebrafish model irrespective of the strains' origin or 
biofilm profile. Therefore, this study brings new insights in S. pettenkoferi 
pathogenicity."
1493,"Since most of the root metabolic activities as well as root elongation and the 
uptake of water and mineral nutrients take place in the distal parts of roots, 
we aimed to gain insight into the physiological and transcriptional changes 
induced by root hypoxia in the distal parts of roots in canola (Brassica napus) 
plants, which are relatively sensitive to flooding conditions. Plants were 
subject to three days of root hypoxia via lowering oxygen content in hydroponic 
medium, and various physiological and anatomical features were examined to 
characterize plant responses. Untargeted transcriptomic profiling approaches 
were also applied to investigate changes in gene expression that took place in 
the distal root tissues in response to hypoxia. Plants responded to three days 
of root hypoxia by reducing growth and gas exchange rates. These changes were 
accompanied by decreases in leaf water potential (Ψleaf) and root hydraulic 
conductivity (Lpr). Increased deposition of lignin and suberin was also observed 
in the root tissues of hypoxic plants. The transcriptomic data demonstrated that 
the effect of hypoxia on plant water relations involved downregulation of most 
BnPIPs in the root tissues with the exception of BnPIP1;3 and BnPIP2;7, which 
were upregulated. Since some members of the PIP1 subfamily of aquaporins are 
known to transport oxygen, the increase in BnPIP1;3 may represent an important 
hypoxia tolerance strategy in plants. The results also demonstrated substantial 
rearrangements of different signaling pathways and transcription factors (TFs), 
which resulted in alterations of genes involved in the regulation of Lpr, TCA 
(tricarboxylic acid) cycle-related enzymes, antioxidant enzymes, and cell wall 
modifications. An integration of these data enabled us to draft a comprehensive 
model of the molecular pathways involved in the responses of distal parts of 
roots in B. napus. The model highlights systematic transcriptomic reprogramming 
aimed at explaining the relative sensitivity of Brassica napus to root hypoxia."
1494,"Natural killer (NK) cells play a role in defence against viral infections by 
killing infected cells or by producing cytokines and interacting with adaptive 
immune cells. Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) regulate the 
activation of NK cells through their interaction with human leucocyte antigens 
(HLA). Ninety-six Sicilian patients positive to Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 
(HIV) and ninety-two Sicilian patients positive to SARS-CoV-2 were genotyped for 
KIRs and their HLA ligands. We also included fifty-six Sicilian patients with 
chronic hepatitis B (CHB) already recruited in our previous study. The aim of 
this study was to compare the distribution of KIR-HLA genes/groups of these 
three different infected populations with healthy Sicilian donors from the 
literature. We showed that the inhibitory KIR3DL1 gene and the KIR3DL1/HLA-B Bw4 
pairing were more prevalent in individual CHB. At the same time, the frequency 
of HLA-C2 was increased in CHB compared to other groups. In contrast, the HLA-C1 
ligand seems to have no contribution to CHB progression whereas it was 
significantly higher in COVID-19 and HIV-positive than healthy controls. These 
results suggest that specific KIR-HLA combinations can predict the 
outcome/susceptibility of these viral infections and allows to plan successful 
customized therapeutic strategies."
1495,"Metabolic syndrome is associated with the development of chronic kidney disease 
(CKD). We previously demonstrated that aged kidneys are prone to developing 
tertiary lymphoid tissues (TLTs) and sustain inflammation after injury, leading 
to CKD progression; however, the relationship between renal TLT and metabolic 
syndrome is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that a high-fat diet (HFD) 
promoted renal TLT formation and inflammation via sterol O-acyltransferase 
(SOAT) 1-dependent mechanism. Mice fed a HFD prior to ischemic reperfusion 
injury (IRI) exhibited pronounced renal TLT formation and sustained inflammation 
compared to the controls. Untargeted lipidomics revealed the increased levels of 
cholesteryl esters (CEs) in aged kidneys with TLT formation after IRI, and, 
consistently, the Soat1 gene expression increased. Treatment with avasimibe, a 
SOAT inhibitor, attenuated TLT maturation and renal inflammation in HFD-fed mice 
subjected to IRI. Our findings suggest the importance of SOAT1-dependent CE 
accumulation in the pathophysiology of CKDs associated with TLT."
1496,"Inborn mutations in the digestive protease carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1) gene may 
be associated with hereditary and idiopathic chronic pancreatitis (CP). 
Pathogenic mutations, such as p.N256K, cause intracellular retention and reduced 
secretion of CPA1, accompanied by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, suggesting 
that mutation-induced misfolding underlies the phenotype. Here, we report the 
novel p.G250A CPA1 mutation found in a young patient with CP. Functional 
properties of the p.G250A mutation were identical to those of the p.N256K 
mutation, confirming its pathogenic nature. We noted that both mutations are in 
a catalytically important loop of CPA1 that is stabilized by the Cys248-Cys271 
disulfide bond. Mutation of either or both Cys residues to Ala resulted in 
misfolding, as judged by the loss of CPA1 secretion and intracellular retention. 
We re-analyzed seven previously reported CPA1 mutations that affect this loop 
and found that all exhibited reduced secretion and caused ER stress of varying 
degrees. The magnitude of ER stress was proportional to the secretion defect. 
Replacing the naturally occurring mutations with Ala (e.g., p.V251A for p.V251M) 
restored secretion, with the notable exception of p.N256A. We conclude that the 
disulfide-stabilized loop of CPA1 is prone to mutation-induced misfolding, in 
most cases due to the disruptive nature of the newly introduced side chain. We 
propose that disease-causing CPA1 mutations exhibit abolished or markedly 
reduced secretion with pronounced ER stress, whereas CPA1 mutations with milder 
misfolding phenotypes may be associated with lower disease risk or may not be 
pathogenic at all."
1497,"Helicobacter pylori infection triggers inflammation that may lead to gastritis, 
stomach ulcers and cancer. Probiotic bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, have been 
of interest as treatment options, however, little is known about the molecular 
mechanisms of Lactobacillus-mediated inhibition of H. pylori pathogenesis. In 
this work, we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus culture supernatants, 
so-called conditioned medium (CM), from two gastric isolates, L. gasseri and L. 
oris, on the expression of transcriptional regulators in H. pylori. Among the 
four known two-component systems (TCSs), i.e., ArsRS, FlgRS, CheAY and CrdRS, 
the flagellar regulator gene flgR and the acid resistance associated arsS gene 
were down-regulated by L. gasseri CM, whereas expression of the other TCS-genes 
remained unaffected. L. gasseri CM also reduced the motility of H. pylori, which 
is in line with reduced flgR expression. Furthermore, among six transcription 
factors of H. pylori only the ferric uptake regulator gene fur was regulated by 
L. gasseri CM. Deletion of fur further led to dramatically increased sensitivity 
to the antimicrobial peptide LL-37. Taken together, the results highlight that 
released/secreted factors of some lactobacilli, but not all, downregulate 
transcriptional regulators involved in motility, acid tolerance and LL-37 
sensitivity of H. pylori."
1498,"Ischaemia, followed by reperfusion, causes the generation of reactive oxygen 
species, overproduction of peroxynitrite, activation of matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs), and subsequently the degradation of heart contractile 
proteins in the cardiomyocytes. Klotho is a membrane-bound or soluble protein 
that regulates mineral metabolism and has antioxidative activity. This study 
aimed to examine the influence of Klotho protein on the MMP-mediated degradation 
of contractile proteins during ischaemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) to the 
cardiomyocytes. Human cardiac myocytes (HCM) underwent in vitro chemical IRI 
(with sodium cyanide and deoxyglucose), with or without the administration of 
recombinant Klotho protein. The expression of MMP genes, the expression and 
activity of MMP proteins, as well as the level of contractile proteins such as 
myosin light chain 1 (MLC1) and troponin I (TnI) in HCM were measured. 
Administration of Klotho protein resulted in a decreased activity of MMP-2 and 
reduced the release of MLC1 and TnI that followed in cells subjected to IRI. 
Thus, Klotho protein contributes to the inhibition of MMP-dependent degradation 
of contractile proteins and prevents injury to the cardiomyocytes during IRI."
1499,"Claudin-2 (CLDN2), a component of tight junctions, is abnormally expressed in 
human lung adenocarcinoma tissue. CLDN2 contributes to chemoresistance in human 
lung adenocarcinoma-derived A549 cells, and it may be a target for cancer 
therapy. Here, we found that coffee ingredients, namely caffeine and 
theobromine, decreased the protein level of CLDN2 in human lung 
adenocarcinoma-derived A549 cells. In contrast, other components, such as 
theophylline and chlorogenic acid, had no effect. These results indicate that 
the 7-methyl group in methylxanthines may play a key role in the reduction in 
CLDN2 expression. The caffeine-induced reduction in the CLDN2 protein was 
inhibited by chloroquine, a lysosome inhibitor. In a protein-stability assay 
using cycloheximide, CLDN2 protein levels decreased faster in caffeine-treated 
cells than in vehicle-treated cells. These results suggest that caffeine 
accelerates the lysosomal degradation of CLDN2. The accumulation and 
cytotoxicity of doxorubicin were dose-dependently increased, which was 
exaggerated by caffeine but not by theophylline in spheroids. Caffeine decreased 
nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) levels without affecting 
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α levels. Furthermore, caffeine decreased the 
expression of Nrf2-targeted genes. The effects of caffeine on CLDN2 expression 
and anticancer-drug-induced toxicity were also observed in lung adenocarcinoma 
RERF-LC-MS cells. We suggest that caffeine enhances doxorubicin-induced toxicity 
in A549 spheroids mediated by the reduction in CLDN2 and Nrf2 expression."
1500,"Determining the adaptive mechanisms by which bumblebees adapt to high altitudes 
can help us to better understand their distribution, providing a basis for the 
future protection and utilization of bumblebee resources. For this study, the 
adaptive mechanisms of two dominant bumblebee species in the northeastern 
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau-Bombus kashmirensis and B. waltoni-were studied through 
transcriptomics methods. For each species, enrichment analysis of the 
differentially expressed genes and gene set enrichment analysis were carried out 
between samples collected at different altitudes (4000 m, 4500 m, and 5000 m). 
The results indicate that these bumblebees tend to up-regulate energy 
metabolism-related genes when facing extremely high-altitude environments. Of 
the enriched pathways up-regulated in higher altitudes, the pentose and 
glucuronate interconversions pathway presented the most severe up-regulation in 
multiple comparisons of different altitudes for B. kashmirensis, as well as the 
AMPK signaling pathway, which was found to be up-regulated in both species. 
Notably, limited by the extreme hypoxic conditions in this study, oxidative 
phosphorylation was found to be down-regulated with increasing altitude, which 
is uncommon in studies on bumblebee adaptation to high altitudes."
1501,"Lepidopteran insects are an important group of animals, including those used as 
biochemical and physiological model species in the insect and silk industries as 
well as others that are major agricultural pests. Therefore, the genome 
sequences of several lepidopteran insects have been reported. The oriental 
armyworm, Mythimna separata, is an agricultural pest commonly used to study 
insect immune reactions and interactions with parasitoid wasps as hosts. To 
improve our understanding of these research topics, reference genome sequences 
were constructed in the present study. Using long-read and short-read sequence 
data, de novo assembly and polishing were performed and haplotigs were purged. 
Subsequently, gene predictions and functional annotations were performed. To 
search for orthologs of the Toll and Immune Deficiency (IMD) pathways and for 
C-type lectins, annotation data analysis, BLASTp, and Hummer scans were 
performed. The M. separata genome is 682 Mbp; its contig N50 was 2.7 Mbp, with 
21,970 genes and 24,452 coding sites predicted. All orthologs of the core 
components of the Toll and IMD pathways and 105 C-type lectins were identified. 
These results suggest that the genome data were of sufficient quality for use as 
reference genome data and could contribute to promoting M. separata and 
lepidopteran research at the molecular and genome levels."
1502,"The lycid genus Mesolycus Gorham, 1883 is mainly distributed in East Palaearctic 
and Indochinese regions, but poorly studied in China; moreover, its phylogenetic 
placement remains controversial but has never been rigorously tested. In this 
study, Mesolycus was reviewed and its placement within Lycidae was tested based 
on a multilocus phylogeny (cox1, nad5, cox2 and Lrna) by both ML and BI 
analyses. The reconstructed phylogenies show that Mesolycus is a consistently 
recovered sister to Dilophotes Waterhouse, 1879, and they form a monophyletic 
clade which is well supported. This suggests that Mesolycus definitely belongs 
to Dilophotini rather than to Macrolycini of Lycinae. Besides, three species 
originally described or placed in Dilophotes are transferred to Mesolycus, 
including M. atricollis (Pic, 1926) comb. n., M. particularis (Pic, 1928) comb. 
n. and M. pacholatkoi (Bic, 2002) comb. n. Four new species are discovered in 
China, including M. shaanxiensis sp. n., M. dentatus sp. n., M. breviplatus sp. 
n. and M. varus sp. n. Two species, M. murzini Kazantsev, 2004 and M. 
rubromarginatus Kazantsev, 2013, are recorded from China for the first time. A 
key for the identification of all Mesolycus species is provided. China was 
revealed as the region with the highest species diversity of this genus."
1503,"Insects' visual system is directly related to ecology and critical for their 
survival. Some cicadas present obvious differences in color and ultrastructure 
of compound eyes between nymphal and adult stages, but little is known about 
when cicadas obtain their visual ability to deal with the novel above-ground 
habitat. We use transcriptome analyses and reveal that cicada Meimuna mongolica 
has a trichromatic color vision system and that the eyes undergo a non-gradual 
development process at the end of the 5th-instar nymphal stage. The white-eye 
5th-instar nymphs (i.e., younger 5th-instar nymphs) have no visual ability 
because critical components of the visual system are deficient. The 
transformation of eyes toward possessing visual function takes place after a 
tipping point in the transition phase from the white-eye period to the 
subsequent red-eye period, which is related to a decrease of Juvenile Hormone. 
The period shortly after adult emergence is also critical for eye development. 
Key differentially-expressed genes related to phototransduction and chromophore 
synthesis play positive roles for cicadas to adapt to above-ground habitat. The 
accumulation of ommochromes corresponds to the color change of eyes from white 
to red and dark brown during the end of the 5th-instar nymphal period. Cuticle 
tanning leads to eye color changing from dark-brown to light-brown during the 
early adult stage. We hypothesize that the accumulation of ommochromes occurring 
at the end of 5th-instar nymphal stage and the early adult stage is not only for 
cicadas to obtain visual ability, but also is a secure strategy to cope with 
potential photodamage after emergence."
1504,"Different developmental stages of insects may be dissimilar in immunity 
functioning. Additionally, the stages often inhabit diverse environments with 
specific microbial communities. In the Colorado potato beetle, a strong increase 
in resistance to entomopathogenic fungi is observed during the intermolt period 
of last-instar larvae, but mechanisms of this change are insufficiently 
understood. We studied changes in the expression of immunity- and stress-related 
genes in the fat body and integument during this intermolt period by 
quantitative PCR. By the end of the instar, there was upregulation of 
transcription factors of Toll, IMD, and Jak-Stat pathways as well as genes 
encoding metalloprotease inhibitors, odorant-binding proteins, and heat shock 
proteins. Nonetheless, the expression of gene LdRBLk encoding β-lectin did not 
change during this period. Most of the aforementioned genes were upregulated in 
response to Metarhizium robertsii topical infection. The expression alterations 
were more pronounced in recently molted larvae than in finishing feeding larvae 
and in the integument compared to the fat body. We believe that upregulation of 
immune-system- and stress-related genes at the end of the intermolt period is an 
adaptation caused by migration of larvae into soil, where the probability of 
encountering entomopathogenic fungi is high."
1505,"(1) Background: Chironomids are biological indicators, playing an important role 
in monitoring and assessing the changes in water ecosystems. Mitochondrial 
genomes have been widely applied as a molecular marker to analyze the taxonomy 
and phylogeny of insects. However, knowledge of the mitogenomes of Chironomus 
species is scarce at present, which limits our understanding of the evolutionary 
relationships among Chironomus. (2) Methods: In our study, the mitogenomes and 
their basic structure of 12 Chironomus species and one Microchironomus species 
were newly sequenced. Combined with reported mitogenomes, a total of 15 
mitogenomes of Chironomus were selected for a comparative mitogenomic analysis 
and phylogenetic reconstruction of Chironomus. (3) Results: Each mitogenome of 
the Chironomus species has the typical 37 genes and a control region. The basic 
structure of the whole mitogenomes of Chironomus species is relatively 
conservative, and the genetic arrangements stay the same as the ancestral 
mitogenome. (4) Conclusions: Our study enriches the library of mitogenomes of 
chironomids and provides a valuable resource for understanding the evolutionary 
history of Chironomus."
1506,"Early domestication and the following improvement are two important processes in 
the cocoon silk evolution of silkworms. In contrast to early domestication, 
understanding of the improvement process is still fuzzy. By systematically 
comparing the larval silk gland transcriptomes of the wild, early domestic, and 
improved silkworms, we highlighted a novel landscape of transcriptome in the 
silk glands of improved ones. We first clarified that silk cocoon protein genes 
were up-regulated in modern breeding but not in early domestication. 
Furthermore, we found that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 
improved and early domestic silkworms (2711), as well as between improved and 
wild silkworms (2264), were obviously more than those between the early domestic 
and wild silkworms (158), with 1671 DEGs specific in the improved silkworm 
(IS-DEGs). Hierarchical clustering of all the DEGs consistently indicated that 
improved silkworms were significantly diverged from the early domestic and wild 
silkworms, suggesting that modern breeding might cause prompt and drastic 
dynamic changes of gene expression in the silk gland. We further paid attention 
to these 1671 IS-DEGs and were surprised to find that down-regulated genes were 
enriched in basic organonitrogen compound biosynthesis, RNA biosynthesis, and 
ribosome biogenesis processes, which are generally universally expressed, 
whereas those up-regulated genes were enriched in organonitrogen compound 
catabolic processes and functions involving in the dynamic regulation of protein 
post-translation of modification. We finally highlighted one candidate 
improvement gene among these up-regulated IS-DEGs, i.e., GDAP2, which may play 
roles in silk behavior and the overall robustness of the improved silkworm. The 
findings strongly suggest that modern breeding may facilitate effective control 
of the basic consumption of nitrogen and a stronger switch of nitrogen resources 
from other tissues to the silk glands, for an efficient supply for silk 
production, and implies the importance of brain behavior and robustness in silk 
yield improvement of modern breeding."
1507,"The management of forest pests has become a significant challenge, particularly 
for wood borers, because they spend most of the time in the trunks or cones. The 
coneworm, Dioryctria&amp;nbsp;abietella, is a representative of cone borers as 
its larvae feed on the cones of Pinaceae plants. The molecular mechanisms 
underlying the interactions between this species and host plants or habitats can 
assist in developing strategies for pest control. In this study, we extended the 
expression profiles of 32 odorant binding proteins (OBPs) in the reproductive 
tissues of D. abietella, revealing the detectable transcription of 29 genes. 
Using two DabiOBPs highly expressed in antennae (DabiOBP5 and DabiOBP14) as 
targets, six compounds with high affinities (dissociation constants &lt; 13 μM) 
were identified through a reverse chemical ecology strategy, including 
insecticides widely used for the control of lepidopteran pests. Of these 
compounds, a floral volatile β-ionone and a pear-produced ester 
ethyl-(2E,4Z)-decadienoate may serve as behaviorally active compounds in D. 
abietella. The strong binding of DabiOBPs to insecticides suggested their 
involvement in insecticide resistance, reflecting sophisticated detoxification 
mechanisms of this moth. In the molecular simulations, DabiOBP14 possessed 
stronger interactions with the six ligands compared to DabiOBP5, in which a few 
key residues within the binding pockets were involved in the formation of 
hydrogen bonds. This study provides some valuable reference active compounds for 
the development of lures or repellents in D. abietella and unravels the putative 
roles of two antenna-dominant DabiOBPs in the perception of plant-derived 
odorants and insecticides."
1508,"This study investigated the genetic differences between Aedes aegypti subspecies 
(Aedes aegypti aegypti (Aaa) and Aedes aegypti formosus (Aaf)) from Sudan using 
the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) mitochondrial gene marker. Nineteen 
distinct haplotypes of the ND4 were identified in female Aedes aegypti 
mosquitoes from the study sites. The phylogenetic relationship of the 19 ND4 
haplotypes was demonstrated in a median-joining haplotype network tree with Aaa 
and Aaf populations found to share three haplotypes. The genetic variance 
(Pairwise FST values) was estimated and found to range from 0.000 to 0.811. 
Isolation by distance test revealed that geographical distance was correlated to 
genetic variation (coefficient value (r) = 0.43). The Polar maximum likelihood 
tree showed the phylogenetic relationship of 91 female Aaa and Aaf from the 
study sites, with most of the Aaf haplotypes clustered in one group while most 
of the Aaa haplotypes gathered in another group, but there was an admixture of 
the subspecies in both clusters, especially the Aaa cluster. The Spatial 
Analysis of Molecular Variance (SAMOVA) test revealed that the eight populations 
clustered into two phylogeographic groups/clusters of the two subspecies 
populations. The 2 Aedes aegypti subspecies seemed not to be totally separated 
geographically with gene flow among the populations."
1509,"Odorant-degrading enzymes (ODEs) are proposed to degrade/inactivate volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs) on a millisecond timescale. Thus, ODEs play an 
important role in the insect olfactory system as a reset mechanism. The 
inhibition of these enzymes could incapacitate the olfactory system and, 
consequently, disrupt chemical communication, promoting and complementing the 
integrated pest management strategies. Here, we report two novel aldehyde 
oxidases, AOX-encoding genes GmelAOX2 and GmelAOX3, though transcriptomic 
analysis in the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella. GmelAOX2 was clustered in 
a clade with ODE function, according to phylogenetic analysis. Likewise, to 
unravel the profile of volatiles that G. mellonella might face besides the sex 
pheromone blend, VOCs were trapped from honeycombs and the identification was 
made by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed 
that GmelAXO2 has a sex-biased expression, and qRT-PCR indicated that both 
GmelAOX2 and GmelAOX3 have a higher relative expression in male antennae rather 
than female antennae. A functional assay revealed that antennal extracts had the 
strongest enzymatic activity against undecanal (4-fold) compared to benzaldehyde 
(control). Our data suggest that these enzymes have a crucial role in 
metabolizing sex pheromone compounds as well as plant-derived aldehydes, which 
are related to honeycombs and the life cycle of G. mellonella."
1510,"In Latin America, Mexico is the country with the second highest annual estimated 
number of Chagas disease cases, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, due to vector-borne 
transmission. The state of Oaxaca is the location of the first documented human 
cases of Chagas disease in Mexico and contained the highest T. cruzi 
seropositive rate (3.5%) from blood donors. Here, entomological surveys, from 
2017 to 2019, were conducted to collect triatomines in 124 villages of 60 
municipalities. Four principal domestic Triatoma spp. (Hemiptera: Triatominae), 
Triatoma phyllosoma, T. barberi, T. mazzotti, and T. dimidiata, of Oaxaca, 
Mexico were identified by morphology and molecular analysis of the barcode 
region of the cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1 or COI or CO1) gene. A total of 41 out 
of 83 T. phyllosoma specimens examined by microscopy were positive for T. cruzi 
(49%), 49 out of 171 for T. barberi (28%), 31 out of 177 for T. mazzotti (17%), 
and none out of 10 for T. dimidiata (0%). Overall, the infestation index was 
3.1% of households containing at least one triatomine; the crowding index was a 
mean of two Triatoma spp./household; and the colonization index was 0.38 for 
households based on presence of nymphs. Geographical distribution of triatomines 
in Oaxaca at the municipality level and endophilic behavior is also reported. 
Precise identification, endophilic habits, and infection rates of these 
triatomines are paramount for vector control programs of the Ministry of Health 
of Oaxaca and beyond."
1511,"Ophiocordyceps sinensis (Berk.)&amp;nbsp;is an entomopathogenic fungus that can 
infect the larva of the ghost moth, Hepialus xiaojinensis, causing mummification 
after more than one year. This prolonged infection provides a valuable model for 
studying the immunological interplay between an insect host and a pathogenic 
fungus. A comparative transcriptome analysis of pre-infection (L) and one-year 
post-infection (IL) larvae was performed to investigate the immune response in 
the host. Here, a total of 59,668 unigenes were obtained using Illumina 
Sequencing in IL and L. Among the 345 identified immune-related genes, 83 out of 
86 immune-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) had a much higher 
expression in IL than in L. Furthermore, the immune-related DEGs were classified 
as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), signal modulators or transductors, and 
immune effector molecules. Serpins and protease inhibitors were found to be 
upregulated in the late phase of infection, suppressing the host's immune 
response. Based on the above analysis, the expression levels of most 
immune-related genes would return to the baseline with the immune response being 
repressed in the late phase of infection, leading to the fungal immunological 
tolerance after prolonged infection. Meanwhile, the transcriptomes of IL and the 
mummified larva (ML) were compared to explore O. sinensis invasion. A total of 
1408 novel genes were identified, with 162 of them annotated with putative 
functions. The gene families likely implicated in O. sinensis pathogenicity have 
been identified, primarily including serine carboxypeptidase, peroxidase, 
metalloprotease peptidase, aminopeptidases, cytochrome P450, and oxidoreductase. 
Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to assess the expression 
levels of some critical genes that were involved in immune response and fungal 
pathogenicity. The results showed that their expression levels were consistent 
with the transcriptomes. Taken together, our findings offered a comprehensive 
and precise transcriptome study to understand the immune defense in H. 
xiaojinensis and O. sinensis invasion, which would accelerate the large-scale 
artificial cultivation of this medicinal fungus."
1512,"In the current era, products made from organic materials enjoy a privileged 
position because of their inherent safety. The eco-friendly properties of 
natural lac resins have increased their demand in many industries. It is 
secreted by sucking insects (Hemiptera, Kerriidae) and comprises three major 
components, viz., resin, dye, and wax. Lac insects are generally bivoltine in 
nature and are distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions with complex 
multi-trophic habitats. Because of their sedentary habits, lac insects are more 
vulnerable to predators, parasitoids, squirrels, and rats, leading to a more 
than 50% reduction in production yield. To increase lac production, 
advanced-level molecular research is required to figure out the mechanism behind 
lac synthesis and secretion to improve lac yield and quality. The present review 
highlights metamorphosis, sexual dimorphism, multi-trophic habitat, host plants, 
and natural enemies of lac insects, lac composition, and applications, 
emphasizing the role of microbes, potential lac genes, and lac synthesis 
mechanisms in enhancing lac quality and production. The information provided 
here might be useful for lac researchers and for stakeholders aiming to make 
their products more eco-friendly."
1513,"The study of the biological diversity of the Arctic zone yields intriguing 
results. Initial research on the lakes of the Yamal Peninsula resulted in the 
identification of Chironomus laetus and the hybrid Ch. laetus × Ch. sp. Le1. To 
avoid misidentification, we used morphological, cytogenetic, and molecular 
genetic approaches. By cytogenetics, in Ch. sp. Le1, seven banding sequences 
were found: Le1A1, Le1B1, Le1C1, Le1D1, Le1E1, Le1F1, and Le1G1. The karyotype 
of Ch. laetus was mapped for the first time; it is the first species with the 
arm combinations AE BC DF G. We propose the name of a new cytocomplex-""laetus"". 
DNA-barcoding of the COI gene was carried out for Ch. laetus and Ch. laetus × 
Ch. sp. Le1 for the first time. The estimated genetic distance between the 
sequences of Ch. laetus and Ch. riihimakiensis is 2.3-2.5%. The high similarity 
in morphology, banding sequences, and the possibility of hybridization indicate 
a close relationship between Ch. laetus and Ch. sp. Le1, which is assumed to be 
the northern variant of Ch. riihimakiensis. Molecular genetic data suggests the 
presence of a subgroup with Ch. laetus."
1514,"Insecticide resistance is a major threat challenging the control of harmful 
insect species. The study of resistant phenotypes is, therefore, pivotal to 
understand molecular mechanisms underpinning insecticide resistance and plan 
effective control and resistance management strategies. Here, we further 
analysed the diflubenzuron (DFB)-resistant phenotype due to the point-mutation 
I1043M in the chitin-synthase 1 gene (chs1) in the mosquito Culex pipiens. By 
comparing susceptible and resistant strains of Cx. pipiens through DFB 
bioassays, molecular analyses and scanning electron microscopy, we showed that 
the I1043M-resistant mosquitoes have: (i) a striking level of DFB resistance 
(i.e., resistance ratio: 9006); (ii) a constitutive 11-fold over-expression of 
the chs1 gene; (iii) enhanced cuticle thickness and cuticular chitin content. 
Culex pipiens is one of the most important vector species in Europe and the 
rapid spread of DFB resistance can threaten its control. Our results, by adding 
new data about the DFB-resistant phenotype, provide important information for 
the control and management of insecticide resistance."
1515,"Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera, Aphidoidae) is a polyphagous pest, whose 
complex phenotypic form, combined with its high fecundity and short reproductive 
cycle, has caused serious economic losses to agriculture worldwide. Photoperiod 
plays an important role in the reproduction of aphids. However, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying its response to seasonal photoperiodic changes are not 
known. In this study, the effects of different photoperiod treatments (8 L:16 D, 
10 L:14 D, 12 L:12 D and 14 L:10 D) on A. gossypii reproduction in the first, 
third, and fifth generations at low temperatures were investigated. Then, 
transcriptome sequencing analysis was performed after the fifth generation of A. 
gossypii, exposed to different photoperiods (8 L:16 D and 12 L:12 D), using 
high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that (I) the effect of 
photoperiod on aphids was gradually evident with increasing exposure 
generations. In general, daylight extension help the A. gossypii to reproduce 
with the optimum photoperiod of L:D 12:12. (II) The transcriptome analysis 
results showed that 170 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (123 downregulated 
and 47 upregulated genes) were identified between aphids under 8 h daylight and 
12 h daylight. (III) Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs 
involved in ""proteolysis"", ""metabolic process"", ""peptidase activity"" and 
""structural molecule activity"" were significantly enriched; Kyoto Encyclopedia 
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that there were more DEGs 
in ""Longevity regulating pathway-multiple species"", ""Lysosome"", ""Endocytosis"", 
""Spliceosome"" and ""Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum"". (IV) Ten 
related genes were chosen for validation of statistical analysis based on 
RNA-Seq by the reverse transcription quantitative (RT-qPCR). The comparison was 
consistent with the expression pattern and supported the accuracy and 
reliability of RNA-Seq. In summary, the genes involved in these pathways play an 
important role in the reproduction of A. gossypii under photoperiodical changes. 
These will contribute to the sustainable management of cotton aphids through the 
disruption of their reproduction by the method of RNA interference in the 
future."
1516,"Baryscapus dioryctriae is a pupal endoparasitoid of many Pyralidae pests and has 
been used as a biocontrol agent against insect pests that heavily damage the 
cone and seed of the Korean pine. The olfactory system of wasps plays an 
essential role in sensing the chemical signals during their foraging, mating, 
host location, etc., and the chemosensory genes are involved in detecting and 
transducing these signals. Many chemosensory genes have been identified from the 
antennae of Hymenoptera; however, there are few reports on the chemosensory 
genes of Eulophidae wasps. In this study, the transcriptome databases based on 
ten different tissues of B. dioryctriae were first constructed, and 274 putative 
chemosensory genes, consisting of 27 OBPs, 9 CSPs, 3 NPC2s, 155 ORs, 49 GRs, 23 
IRs and 8 SNMPs genes, were identified based on the transcriptomes and manual 
annotation. Phylogenetic trees of the chemosensory genes were constructed to 
investigate the orthologs between B. dioryctriae and other insect species. 
Additionally, twenty-eight chemosensory genes showed female antennae- and 
ovipositor-biased expression, which was validated by RT-qPCR. These findings not 
only built a molecular basis for further research on the processes of 
chemosensory perception in B. dioryctriae, but also enriched the identification 
of chemosensory genes from various tissues of Eulophidae wasps."
1517,"Macquartia Robineau-Desvoidy (Diptera: Tachinidae, Tachininae) represents one of 
the most ancient evolutionary lineages of tachinids, parasitizing Chrysomelidae 
larvae. We found four new Macquartia species collected by malaise traps, namely 
M. brunneisquama sp. nov., M. chinensis sp. nov., M.&amp;nbsp;flavifemorata sp. 
nov., and M. flavipedicel sp. nov. These new species are described and 
illustrated, and their comparison with congeners as well as an identification 
key to the 12 species of Macquartia from China known to date are included. To 
determine the significance of the mitogenome architecture and evolution across 
different tachinid lineages of this primitive taxonomic group, four complete 
mitochondrial genomes were sequenced, annotated, and analyzed. The gene 
arrangements are consistent with the ancestral insect mitogenomes. The 
full-length sequences and protein-coding genes (PCGs) of the mitogenomes of the 
four species are all AT-biased. Analyses of Ka/Ks and overall p-genetic distance 
demonstrated that nad5 showed the highest evolutionary rate and nad1/nad4L were 
the most conserved genes among the four species. Phylogenetic reconstruction 
based on 13 PCGs strongly supported the monophyly of Macquartia, and the 
relationships of the four species are (M.&amp;nbsp;flavifemorata + (M. 
flavipedicel + (M. brunneisquama + M. chinensis))). This study will help enhance 
our understanding of the taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships in 
Tachinidae."
1518,"The biological insecticide, Ectropis obliqua nucleopolyhedrovirus (EcobNPV), has 
been applied to control the major tea-pest Ectropis grisescens. Previously, the 
virus strain EcobNPV-QF4 showed higher a mortality rate (58.2% vs. 88.2%) and 
shorter median lethal-time (13.9 d vs. 15.4 d) on E. grisescens than the strain 
EcobNPV-QV. However, the mechanism of the difference in virulence between the 
two strains remains unclear. Using the leaf-disc method, we detected the 
virulence of the two strains on 3rd-instar larvae, and found that median 
lethal-dose (LD50) of EcobNPV-QF4 is 55-fold higher than that of EcobNPV-QV 
(4.35 × 108 vs. 7.89 × 106). Furthermore, fourteen larva transcriptomes of E. 
grisescens were subsequently sequenced at seven time-points after ingestion of 
the two virus strains, yielding 410.72 Gb of raw reads. Differential 
gene-expression analysis shows that 595, 87, 27, 108, 0, 12, and 290 genes were 
up-regulated in EcobNPV-QF4 at 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, 36 h and 48 h post ingestion 
(hpi), while 744, 68, 152, 8, 1, 0, 225 were down-regulated. KEGG enrichment 
showed that when the virus first invades (eats the leaf-discs), EcobNPV-QF4 
mainly affects pathways such as ribosome (p-value = 2.47 × 10-29), and at 48 hpi 
EcobNPV-QF4, causes dramatic changes in the amino-acid-synthesis pathway and 
ribosome pathway (p-value = 6.94 × 10-13) in E. grisescens. Among these, 
thirteen key genes related to immunity were screened. The present study provides 
the first ever comprehensive analysis of transcriptional changes in E. 
grisescens after ingestion of the two strains of EcobNPV."
1519,"Since its introduction to Asia, Aedes aegypti has coexisted with the native 
species Ae. albopictus and has been reported to transmit several infectious 
diseases. However, the development of efficient disease prevention and vector 
control is hindered by the relatively poor understanding of the biogeography and 
the genetic diversity of Ae. aegypti in the region. This study aimed to 
determine the invasion patterns of Ae. aegypti by evaluating the distribution 
and abundance of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in different climatic regions 
(northern temperate and southern tropical regions) and habitats (domestic, 
peri-domestic, and natural). We further analyzed the genetic diversity and 
phylogenetic relationships of Ae. aegypti populations in Vietnam using 
mitochondrial COI gene sequences. Both Aedes species were observed at most of 
the study sites, but only Ae. albopictus thrived in northern mountainous areas. 
In sympatric ranges, the individual abundance of the species was influenced by 
regional climate and habitats. The tropical climate and availability of domestic 
containers facilitated the dominance of Ae. aegypti, whereas temperate climates 
and natural breeding sites facilitated that of Ae. albopictus. In addition, many 
genetic polymorphisms were detected in the Ae. aegypti populations, which formed 
two distinct genetic groups; however, this genetic diversity is unlikely to be 
relevant to the invasive success of Ae. aegypti. These findings provide insights 
into the mechanisms and patterns of Ae. Aegypti invasion, which depend on the 
climate and reproductive strategies in the native range of Ae. albopictus in 
Asia."
1520,"Spodoptera frugiperda is an agricultural pest causing substantial damage and 
losses to commercial crops. Sex pheromones are critical for successful mating in 
Lepidoptera and have been used for monitoring and control of many pest species. 
The sex pheromone of S. frugiperda is known, but the genes involved in its 
biosynthesis have not been identified. We systematically studied 99 candidate 
sex pheromone genes in the genome of S. frugiperda including 1 acetyl-CoA 
carboxylase (ACC), 11 fatty acid synthases (FASs), 17 desaturases (DESs), 4 
fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs), 29 fatty acyl-CoA reductases (FARs), 17 
acetyl-CoA acetyltransferases (ACTs), 5 acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACDs), 3 
enoyl-CoA hydratases (ECHs), 3 hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases (HCDs), 6 
ethyl-CoA thiolases (KCTs), and 3 acyl-CoA-binding proteins (ACBPs). Based on 
the comparative transcriptome results, we found 22 candidate sex pheromone 
biosynthesis genes predominately expressed in pheromone glands (PGs) than 
abdomens without PGs including SfruFAS4, SfruFATP3, SfruACD5, SfruKCT3, 
SfruDES2, SfruDES5, SfruDES11, SfruDES13, SfruFAR1, SfruFAR2, SfruFAR3, 
SfruFAR6, SfruFAR7, SfruFAR8, SfruFAR9, SfruFAR10, SfruFAR11, SfruFAR14, 
SfruFAR16, SfruFAR29, SfruACT6, and SfruACT10. A combination of phylogenetic and 
tissue-specific transcriptomic analyses indicated that SfruDES5, SfruDES11, 
SfruFAR2, SfruFAR3, and SfruFAR9 may be key genes involved in the sex pheromone 
synthesis of S. frugiperda. Our results could provide a theoretical basis for 
understanding the molecular mechanisms of sex pheromone biosynthesis in S. 
frugiperda, and also provide new targets for developing novel pest control 
methods based on disrupting sexual communication."
1521,"Alpine lakes play a significant role in improving watershed ecology, adjusting 
water storage, and managing regional water resources. They are also a valuable 
freshwater reservoir, flood storage, and species gene pool in Central Asia. This 
article validated the accuracy of the CryoSat-2 footprints altimetry dataset for 
the Lake Bosten and Lake Issyk-Kul ranges. The time series for the surface 
elevations of the Central Asian alpine lakes Karakul and Chatyrkul were 
established, based on footprints altimetry data. The lake hydrological drivers 
were analyzed using remote sensing meteorological reanalysis data of the lake 
basins. The following main conclusions were reached. The CryoSat-2 footprints 
altimetry dataset has high confidence in lake surface elevation monitoring. 
Compared with Hydroweb monitoring results, the agreement between the monitoring 
results in the range between Lake Bosten and Lake Issyk-Kul are 0.96 and 0.84. 
The surface elevation of Lake Karakul shows an overall increasing trend with a 
variation rate of +7.7 cm/yr from 2010 to 2020, which has a positive correlation 
with the temperature in the basin. This indicates that the increased 
temperature, which results in the increased snow and ice meltwater in the basin, 
is the main driving force of the increased lake evolution. The lake surface 
elevation of Lake Chatyrkul shows an overall decreasing trend, with a variation 
rate of -9.9 cm/yr from 2010 to 2020, which has a negative correlation with the 
temperature in the basin. This suggests that Lake Chatyrkul is poorly recharged 
by snow and ice meltwater. The main driving force of its evolution is the 
increased evaporative output of the lake due to the increase in temperature. 
These conclusions prove that temperature and alpine glacial variability within 
the lake basin play an important role in lake surface elevation variations in 
alpine regions of Central Asia."
1522,"The purpose of the study is to determine the impact of local heating on skeletal 
muscle transcriptional response related to mitochondrial biogenesis and 
mitophagy. Twelve healthy subjects (height, 176.0 ± 11.9 cm; weight, 83.6 ± 18.3 
kg; and body composition, 19.0 ± 7.7% body fat) rested in a semi-reclined 
position for 4 h with a heated thermal wrap (HOT) around one thigh and a wrap 
without temperature regulation (CON) around the other (randomized). Skin 
temperature, blood flow, intramuscular temperature, and a skeletal muscle biopsy 
from the vastus lateralis were obtained after the 4 h intervention. Skin 
temperature via infrared thermometer and thermal camera was higher after HOT 
(37.3 ± 0.7 and 36.7 ± 1.0 °C, respectively) than CON (34.8 ± 0.7, 35.2 ± 0.8 
°C, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). Intramuscular temperature was higher in HOT 
(36.3 ± 0.4 °C) than CON (35.2 ± 0.8 °C, p &lt; 0.001). Femoral artery blood 
flow was higher in HOT (304.5 ± 12.5 mL‧min-1) than CON (272.3 ± 14.3 mL‧min-1, 
p = 0.003). Mean femoral shear rate was higher in HOT (455.8 ± 25.1 s-1) than 
CON (405.2 ± 15.8 s-1, p = 0.019). However, there were no differences in any of 
the investigated genes related to mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α, NRF1, GAPBA, 
ERRα, TFAM, VEGF) or mitophagy (PINK-1, PARK-2, BNIP-3, BNIP-3L) in response to 
heat (p &gt; 0.05). These data indicate that heat application alone does not 
impact the transcriptional response related to mitochondrial homeostasis, 
suggesting that other factors, in combination with skeletal muscle temperature, 
are involved with previous observations of altered exercise induced gene 
expression with heat."
1523,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) seriously affects children's health. In our 
previous study, we isolated and identified a bacterium (Lactobacillus plantarum 
strain 6-1) that is resistant to propionic acid (PA), which has been reported to 
play a significant role in the formation of ASD. In order to elucidate the 
mechanism of the resistance to PA, this study investigated the change in the 
metabolic and proteomic profile of L. plantarum strain 6-1 in the presence and 
absence of PA. The results show that 967 and 1078 proteins were specifically 
identified in the absence and the presence of PA, respectively, while 616 
proteins were found under both conditions. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of 
130 differentially expressed proteins accumulated in the presence and absence of 
PA indicated that most of the proteins belong to biological processes, cellular 
components, and molecular functions. Pathway enrichment analysis showed a great 
reduction in the metabolic pathway-related proteins when this resistant 
bacterium was exposed to PA compared to the control. Furthermore, there was an 
obvious difference in protein-protein interaction networks in the presence and 
the absence of propionic acid. In addition, there was a change in the metabolic 
profile of L. plantarum strain 6-1 when this bacterium was exposed to PA 
compared to the control, while six peaks at 696.46, 1543.022, 1905.241, 
2004.277, 2037.374, and 2069.348 m/z disappeared. Overall, the results could 
help us to understand the mechanism of the resistance of gut bacteria to PA, 
which will provide a new insight for us to use PA-resistant bacteria to prevent 
the development of ASD in children."
1524,"Dengue virus (DENV) was detected in Senegal in 1979 for the first time. Since 
2017, unprecedented frequent outbreaks of DENV were noticed yearly. In this 
context, epidemiological and molecular evolution data are paramount to decipher 
the virus diffusion route. In the current study, we focused on a dengue outbreak 
which occurred in Senegal in 2018 in the context of a large religious gathering 
with 263 confirmed DENV cases out of 832 collected samples, including 25 
life-threatening cases and 2 deaths. It was characterized by a co-circulation of 
dengue serotypes 1 and 3. Phylogenetic analysis based on the E gene revealed 
that the main detected serotype in Touba was DENV-3 and belonged to Genotype 
III. Bayesian phylogeographic analysis was performed and suggested one viral 
introduction around 2017.07 (95% HPD = 2016.61-2017.57) followed by cryptic 
circulation before the identification of the first case on 1 October 2018. 
DENV-3 strains are phylogenetically related, with strong phylogenetic links 
between strains retrieved from Burkina Faso and other West African countries. 
These phylogenetic data substantiate epidemiological data of the origin of 
DENV-3 and its spread between African countries and subsequent diffusion after 
religious mass events. The study also highlighted the usefulness of a mobile 
laboratory during the outbreak response, allowing rapid diagnosis and resulting 
in improved patient management."
1525,"Jingpo Lake is the largest mountain barrier lake in China and plays a key role 
in breeding, power generation, and providing a source of drinking water. 
Microbes are important participants in the formation of lake resources and 
energy cycles. However, the ecological protection of Jingpo Lake has faced 
serious challenges in recent years. In this study, we investigate the responses 
of the microbial community's composition of sediments at five locations to an 
environmental gradient representing water quality and water-depth changes using 
a metagenomic sequence. We found that the diversity and composition of the 
microbiota sediments were altered spatially and correlated with the 
physicochemical factors of water samples. In the microbial community, relatively 
lower Chao1, alternating conditional expectations, and Shannon and Simpson 
indices were found at the shallowest location with higher total phosphorus and 
chlorophyll a. Furthermore, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis 
revealed that the metabolism function was the most abundant functional 
classification in Jingpo Lake. The levels of total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and 
pH were positively correlated with the abundance of Flavobacterium and the 
bacterial functions of the carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism. In 
conclusion, our results reveal the physical and chemical characteristics, as 
well as the microbial community characteristics, of Jingpo Lake, which provides 
new insights for studying the relationship between environmental factors and the 
bacterial community distribution of freshwater ecosystems, in addition to also 
providing a theoretical basis for the environmental monitoring and protection of 
the lake."
1526,"Frailty is a major challenge facing the aging world. The phenotype of the frail 
subject is still far from being satisfactorily defined. We report data on mood, 
cognition, and quality of life (QoL) in relation to anamnestic factors, health, 
and socio-economic status in the FRASNET geriatric population (1204 subjects in 
stable health conditions), which is an observational cohort study that includes 
fairly balanced groups of Italian frail (421, 35%), pre-frail (449, 37.3%) and 
robust (334, 27.7%) subjects. A conditional inference tree analysis revealed a 
substantial influence of psychological variables on frailty. The physical 
indicator of QoL (Short Form Survey-36-Physical Component Summary, SF-36-PCS) 
was the predominant variable in the full model (threshold at 39.9, p &lt; 
0.001): higher frailty was found in subjects with a caregiver and lower 
SF-36-PCS. Frailty was also associated with the mental indicator of QoL (Short 
Form Survey-36-Mental Component Summary, SF-36-MCS), depression (Geriatric 
Depression Scale, GDS-15), leisure activities, and level of education. In 
support of the prominent role of inflammation in aging and mental illness, the 
SF-36-PCS score was correlated with the blood concentration of C-X-C motif 
chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) (r Pearson -0.355, p = 0.015), a critical signal in 
cell senescence and inflammaging, while the rs7567647 variant in FN1 gene 
encoding a glycoprotein in the extracellular matrix was significantly associated 
with frailty in a multivariable model (p = 0.0006). The perception of 
health-related QoL and subclinical depression contribute to frailty. Their 
assessment could improve the identification of older patients at increased risk 
of adverse outcomes."
1527,"Pre-existing diabetes, hypertension and kidney disorders are prominent risk 
factors of pre-eclampsia (PE). It is a multifactorial pregnancy disorder 
associated with high blood pressure, proteinuria, and multiorgan failure, which 
develops after the 20th week of pregnancy. It is one of the most feared 
pregnancy disorders, as it consumes thousands of fetomaternal lives per annum. 
According to clinical and pathological studies, the placenta appears to be a key 
player in the pathogenesis of PE; however, the exact origin of this disorder is 
still under debate. Defective placentation and angiogenesis are the hallmarks of 
PE progression. This angiogenic imbalance, together with maternal 
susceptibility, might determine the severity and clinical presentation of PE. 
This article comprehensively examines the mechanisms of pathogenesis of PE and 
current evidence of the factors involved in its progression. Finally, this 
article will explore the genetic association of PE, various candidate genes, 
their proposed mechanisms and variants involved in its pathogenesis."
1528,"BACKGROUND: Cancer is very disruptive in adolescence and hospitalizations 
interfere with this development stage in becoming independent, developing social 
relationships, and making plans for the future. A major challenge in the care of 
adolescents with cancer is being able to enhance their quality of life. The aim 
of this project is to increase our understanding of how adventure therapy 
influenced quality of life for adolescents with cancer.
METHODS: Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, in collaboration with the Tender to 
Nave Italia Foundation (TTNI), has been conducting a unique project, located on 
a beautiful brigantine of the Italian Navy. Adventure therapy is a form of 
experiential therapy that consists of various types of adventure, in particular 
outdoor and sailing activities. Ninety teenagers have been the protagonists of 
this project to date and filled out two questionnaires about quality of life and 
self-esteem, before and after the sailing experience.
RESULTS: The adventure provides the opportunity for the participants to build 
interpersonal relationships and develop life skills that they can benefit from 
in the future experiences. All participants report a significant improvement in 
their quality of life and self-esteem at the end of this experience.
CONCLUSION: This collaborative adventure project is a great way to learn and 
practice new behaviors, improve interpersonal skills, heal painful emotions, 
overcome personal obstacles and challenges, and help the teenagers to resume 
their developmental path after an onco-hematological diagnosis."
1529,"Drinking water is an important natural resource. For many people worldwide, 
especially in developing countries, access to safe drinking water is still a 
dream. An increasing number of human activities and industrialization have 
caused various physical, chemical, and biological pollutants to enter water 
bodies, affecting human health. Water pollutants contain a vast number of 
additives, such as perfluorinated chemicals, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, 
phthalate, nanomaterials, insecticides, microcystins, heavy metals, and 
pharmacologies. In this work, we aim to explore the potential relationship 
between water pollutants and human diseases. Here, we explored an integrative 
approach to identify genes, biological processes, molecular functions, and 
diseases linked to exposure to these water pollutants. These processes and 
functions affected by water pollutants are related to many diseases, including 
colonic neoplasms, breast neoplasms, hepatitis B, bladder cancer, and human 
cytomegalovirus infection. In addition, further analysis revealed the genes that 
play a key role in the human diseases induced by water pollutants. Therefore, 
conducting an integrative toxicogenomic analysis of water pollutants is more 
appropriate for evaluating the potential effects of water pollutants on human 
health."
1530,"The availability of massive gene expression data has been challenging in terms 
of how to cure, process, and extract useful information. Here, we describe the 
use of entropic measures as discriminating criteria in cancer using the whole 
data set of gene expression levels. These methods were applied in classifying 
samples between tumor and normal type for 13 types of tumors with a high success 
ratio. Using gene expression, ordered by pathways, results in complexity-entropy 
diagrams. The map allows the clustering of the tumor and normal types samples, 
with a high success rate for nine of the thirteen, studied cancer types. Further 
analysis using information distance also shows good discriminating behavior, 
but, more importantly, allows for discriminating between cancer types. Together, 
our results allow the classification of tissues without the need to identify 
relevant genes or impose a particular cancer model. The used procedure can be 
extended to classification problems beyond the reported results."
1531,"Social media is one of the most common sources of medical information. We aimed 
to evaluate the information contained on websites, including social media and 
descriptions of fundraisers, in terms of the reliability of knowledge about SMA 
and gene therapy with onasemnogen abeparvovec. We used a set of available online 
links found using the Newspointtool. Initially, 1525 texts were included in the 
study, and after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 112 texts were 
qualified for analysis using the DISCERN scale and the set of questions prepared 
by the authors. We observed that most of the texts had poor (48.65%) and medium 
(27.03%) reliability in the final reliability assessment. All the texts selected 
for the study were related to gene therapy, although few contained key 
information about it. In addition, the authors of the entries used various words 
and phrases that influenced the readers' perceptions of the text. Of the 
analyzed sources, 68.8% had an emotional component. Social media is a poor 
source of information about gene therapy for SMA in Poland. The analyzed texts 
do not provide a full and complete description of the SMA problem. However, it 
is important to remember that the Internet is a changing source of information 
and will hopefully contain more relevant entries in the future."
1532,"This study attempts to present the antimicrobial resistance, virulence and 
resistance genes of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolated from 
raw goat's and sheep's milk and cheese. Strains were identified by PCR. The 
dominant species was E. faecalis (77.8%) and was most often isolated from raw 
goat's milk. The percentage of antimicrobial-resistant E. faecalis isolates was 
higher than that of E. faecium isolates, the former most frequently resistant to 
lincomycin (98%), tetracycline (63%) and streptomycin (16%). Fourteen (22.3%) E. 
faecalis and 2 (11.1%) E. faecium isolates were identified as 
multidrug-resistant (MDR). All MDR E. faecalis strains also had virulence genes, 
whereas one of the two E. faecium strains had them. The most prevalent virulence 
genes in E. faecalis isolates were asa1 (69.8%) and gelE (57.1%). The most 
prevalent resistance genes found in both bacterial species were tet(M) (43.2%) 
and vgaA (22.2%). Enterococci from dairy products are confirmed to be a 
potential source of the spread of antimicrobial resistance, MDR strains, and 
virulence and resistance genes. This study highlights several aspects of the 
virulence and pathogenicity of E. faecalis and E. faecium isolated from dairy 
products-aspects which are indications for their ongoing monitoring."
1533,"Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major foodborne pathogens and can cause 
serious foodborne illness in humans by foods contaminated with S. aureus 
enterotoxins. In recent years, livestock-associated S. aureus has been a major 
public health concern for humans and has emerged in various countries globally. 
China is one of the largest producers of pigs and pork in the world. However, 
there are few studies on the detailed genotypic and pathogenic characterization 
of pork-associated S. aureus in China. In this study, the prevalence, 
antimicrobial resistance, and genotypic characteristics of S. aureus in raw pork 
in Wuhan, China, were investigated through multilocus sequence typing (MLST), 
staphylococcal protein A gene (spa) typing, and whole-genome sequencing 
analysis. A total of 518 S. aureus isolates (16.9%) were isolated from 3067 
retail and wholesale pork samples. The prevalence of S. aureus in retail pork 
(22.7%) was significantly higher than in wholesale pork (15.1%), while the 
proportion of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates in wholesale pork (12.9%) was 
significantly higher than in retail pork (6.2%). Among the isolates, 10.8% were 
resistant to three or more antibiotics, with higher rates of resistance to 
penicillin (88.8%) and erythromycin (58.1%). A total of 28 sequence types (STs) 
were identified in the 518 isolates, and the predominant type was ST7 (57.5%), 
followed by ST5 (9.1%). In addition, based on the whole-genome sequences of 39 
representative strains, 17 spa types were identified among the isolates, of 
which t899, t091, and t437 were the most common. Furthermore, 19 staphylococcal 
enterotoxin (SE) and SE-like (SEl) toxin genes were detected in the isolates, of 
which selw was the most common type (100%), followed by sei, sem, seo, seu, and 
selv (46.2%); sey (35.9%); and sea, seg, and sen (33.3%). This study found for 
the first time that ST7-t091-selw and ST9-t899-SCCmecXII-selw were the 
predominant genotypes of S. aureus in pork in China, which indicated the 
spreading of S. aureus with multiple virulence factors, especially with new 
SE/SEl types in pigs and pork, is a serious new challenge for food safety. Good 
hygiene and good production practices to prevent interspecies transmission and 
cross-contamination of S. aureus in the pig-pork chain are of great significance 
to public health."
1534,"Shiitake mushroom, Lentinula edodes, is the second largest edible fungus in the 
world, with a characteristic aroma. 1,2,3,5,6-pentathioheterocycloheptane, 
commonly known as lenthionine, is the main source of this aroma. Lenthionine has 
high commercial value, and if we explore the possible induction mechanism of 
citric acid in lenthionine synthesis, we can provide a reference for the 
effective application of citric acid as an inducer. In this paper, the 
single-factor treatment of Lentinula edodes with variable citric acid 
concentration and treatment duration showed that the best citric acid 
concentration for L. edodes was 300 μM, and the best treatment duration was 15 
days. Additionally, the optimal design conditions were obtained using the 
response surface method (RSM); the treatment concentration was 406 μM/L, the 
treatment duration was 15.6 days, and the lenthionine content was 130 μg/g. 
γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (LEGGT) and cystine sulfoxide lyase (LECSL) are the 
key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lanthionine. The expression levels 
of LEGGT and LECSL genes increased significantly under citric acid treatment. 
Additionally, the lenthionine content of the silenced strains of LEGGT and LECSL 
was significantly decreased."
1535,"Atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) is a potential green preservation technology, but 
its preservation mechanism is still unclear, and the effects of different plasma 
intensities on postharvest tomatoes are little studied. In this study, the 
effects of different ACP treatments (0 kV, 40 kV, 60 kV, and 80 kV) on the 
sensory quality, physiological indexes, key enzyme activities, and gene 
expression related to the chlorophyll metabolism of postharvest tomatoes were 
investigated during the storage time. The results showed that compared with the 
control group, the tomatoes in the plasma treatment group had a higher hardness 
and total soluble solid (TSS) and titratable acid (TA) contents, a lower 
respiratory intensity and weight loss rate, a higher brightness, and a lower red 
transformation rate, especially in the 60 kV treatment group. In addition, 
chlorophyll degradation, carotenoid accumulation, and chlorophyllase and 
pheophorbide a mono-oxygenase (PAO) enzyme activities in the postharvest 
tomatoes were inhibited in the 60 kV treatment group, and the expressions of 
three key genes related to chlorophyll metabolism, chlorophyll (CLH1), 
pheophytinase (PPH), and red chlorophyll catabolic reductase (RCCR) were 
down-regulated. The results of the correlation analysis also confirmed that the 
enzyme activity and gene expression of the chlorophyll metabolism were regulated 
by the ACP treatment, aiming to maintain the greenness of postharvest tomatoes."
1536,"Silkworm pupa oil (SPO) contains unsaturated fatty acids, tocopherols, and 
phytosterols, which can regulate serum total cholesterol or be used as an 
antioxidant. In this study, we investigated the impacts of SPO on the 
antioxidant stress and lipid metabolism of Caenorhabditis elegans. The lifespan 
of the C. elegans fed with different SPO concentrations was determined. The 
levels of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed with the 
fluorescent probe method. The activity of antioxidant enzymes and the content of 
malondialdehyde (MDA) were analyzed. The transcription level of specific mRNA 
was characterized with q-PCR. The survival time of the mutant strain under 
oxidative stress was determined by daf-2 (CB1370) mutant, sod-3 (GA186) mutant, 
and skn-1 (EU31) mutant. As for the lipid metabolism, the lipid accumulation was 
determined with an Oil-Red-O (ORO) staining. The transcription level of specific 
mRNA was determined by q-PCR. The results showed that the SPO feeding enhanced 
the activities of antioxidant enzyme by upregulating the expression of the genes 
skn-1, and sod-3 to decrease the production of ROS and MDA, which prolonged the 
life of nematodes treated with juglone. ORO staining analysis indicated the 
feeding of SPO decreased intestinal fat accumulation, downregulated expression 
of fat-5, fat-6, fat-7, and nhr-80, and upregulated age-1 and tph-1 expression. 
Conclusively, SPO enhanced the antioxidant capacity by regulating the skn-1 and 
sod-3 expression of antioxidant gene and reducing the fat accumulation by the 
insulin/IGF signaling pathway and nuclear hormone receptor nhr-80 signaling 
pathway of nematodes. This study provides new evidence for the antioxidant and 
lipid-lowering mechanisms of SPO in C. elegans."
1537,"Crossbreeding significantly improves meat production performance in sheep; 
however, whether hybridization changes the meat quality characteristics of lambs 
is uncertain. We analyzed the effects of three different hybrid sires on muscle 
fiber characteristics (MFCs), fatty acid composition (FAC), and volatile flavor 
compounds (VFCs) in lambs under identical feeding conditions. Compared with 
those of purebred lambs, the muscle fiber diameter and cross-sectional areas of 
the crossbred lambs were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05), and the collagen 
fiber content was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05). The numbers and area 
ratios of the fast and slow muscle fibers did not significantly differ between 
the purebred and crossbred lambs, but the expressions of four MyHC gene types 
differed significantly (p &lt; 0.05). Twenty-three fatty acids were identified 
in both the purebred and crossbred lambs, of which thirteen were differentially 
expressed (p &lt; 0.05). Saturated fatty acid (SFA) contents in the crossbred 
lambs were significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05), whereas the monounsaturated 
fatty acid content was significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05). Polyunsaturated 
fatty acid/SFA and n-6/n-3 ratios were significantly lower in the crossbred 
lambs than in the purebred lambs (p &lt; 0.05). Twenty-five VFCs were identified 
among the three hybrids, and aldehydes were the main VFCs. Eleven VFCs were 
differentially expressed in the crossbred lambs (p &lt; 0.05). Hybrid sires 
affected the MFCs, FAC, and VFCs of the F1 lambs, thus providing a reference for 
high-quality mutton production."
1538,"Highland barley (Hordeum vulgare L. HB) has been demonstrated to have a series 
of dietotherapy values, including being low fat, low sugar, high fiber, and 
especially high in β-glucan. Long-term consumption could reduce the incidence of 
chronic diseases and metabolic syndromes. In this study, the regulating effect 
of modified highland barley (MHB) products, namely microwave fluidized HB, 
extruded and puffed HB, and ultrafine pulverized HB on lipid metabolism and 
liver injury in mice fed a high fat and cholesterol diet (HFCD) was investigated 
using microbiota diversity gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. A total 
of six groups of mice were supplemented with a normal diet or an HFCD, with or 
without MHB, and the experimental period lasted 10 weeks. The obtained results 
demonstrated that MHB supplementation could effectively reverse the increase in 
body weight gain and adipose tissue accumulation caused by an HFCD (p &lt; 
0.05). Moreover, serum biochemical parameters showed that MHB supplementation 
significantly decreased total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, while increasing 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. The results of hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) assays showed that MHB supplementation could significantly 
improve the liver injury and adipose tissue accumulation. In addition, 16S rRNA 
amplicon sequencing showed that MHB supplementation increased the 
bacteroidetes/firmicutes ratio and the abundance Lactobacillus abundance, while 
also decreasing the Proteobacteria abundance, which are bacteria closely 
associated with the hyperlipidemia caused by HFCD. LC-MS metabolomics indicated 
that MHB supplementation significantly enhanced the levels of Deoxycholic acid, 
Myclobutanil, 3-Epiecdysone, 3,4-Dihydroxybenzeneacetic acid, and so on. In 
addition, MHB supplementation promoted activation of the Arachidonic acid 
metabolism pathways, the expression of ABC transporters, bile secretion, primary 
bile acid biosynthesis, and so on. Above all, this study showed the potential 
capacity of MHB to relieve hyperlipidemia and provides a reference for 
developing a new dietary intervention supplement to ameliorate hyperlipidemia."
1539,"Human-pathogenic Vibrio bacteria are acquired by oysters through filtering 
seawater, however, the relationships between levels of these bacteria in 
measured in oysters and overlying waters are inconsistent across regions. The 
reasons for these discrepancies are unclear hindering our ability to assess if 
-or when- seawater samples can be used as a proxy for oysters to assess risk. We 
investigated whether concentrations of total and human pathogenic Vibrio 
vulnificus (vvhA and pilF genes) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (tlh, tdh and trh 
genes) measured in seawater reflect concentrations of these bacteria in oysters 
(Crassostrea virginica) cultured within the US lower Chesapeake Bay region. We 
measured Vibrio spp. concentrations using an MPN-qPCR approach and analyzed the 
data using structural equation modeling (SEM). We found seawater concentrations 
of these bacteria to predictably respond to temperature and salinity over 
chlorophyll a, pheophytin or turbidity. We also inferred from the SEM results 
that Vibrio concentrations in seawater strongly predict their respective 
concentrations in oysters. We hypothesize that such seawater-oyster coupling can 
be observed in regions of low tidal range. Due to the ease of sampling and 
processing of seawater samples compared to oyster samples, we suggest that under 
low tidal range conditions, seawater samples can foster increased spatial and 
temporal coverage and complement data associated with oyster samples."
1540,"Beef contains an array of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers for which 
positive effects have been reported in animal models of human disease. The 
objectives were to develop a CLA-enriched beef production system and to assess 
its quality. Sixty Spring-born heifers were housed in Autumn and offered 
unwilted grass silage and a barley/soyabean concentrate or wilted grass silage 
and a concentrate containing sunflower oil and fish oil. In May, both groups 
were offered either pasture for 22 weeks, restricted pasture and sunflower oil 
and fish oil for 22 weeks, or pasture for 11 weeks and restricted pasture and 
sunflower oil and fish oil for the final 11 weeks. The predominant CLA isomer in 
beef was cis9, trans11 representing on average, 80% total CLA. The modified 
winter diet followed by supplementation for 22 weeks resulted in beef that had a 
CLA concentration that was higher, at a comparable intramuscular fatty acid 
concentration, than previously reported. The lipid and colour stability (over 10 
days in modified atmosphere packaging) and sensory characteristics were 
generally not negatively affected. There were minor effects on the expression of 
candidate genes involved in lipid metabolism. Consumption of this beef would 
make a substantial contribution to the quantity of CLA suggested to have a 
positive effect on consumer health."
1541,"Klebsiella pneumoniae can cause serious pneumonitis in humans. The bacterium is 
also the common causative agent of hospital-acquired multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
infections. Here we for the first time reported the genetic diversity of K. 
pneumoniae strains in 14 species of edible aquatic animals sampled in the summer 
of 2018 and 2019 in Shanghai, China. Virulence-related genes were present in the 
K. pneumoniae strains (n = 94), including the entB (98.9%), mrkD (85.1%), fimH 
(50.0%), and ybtA (14.9%) strains. Resistance to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 
was the most prevalent (52.1%), followed by chloramphenicol (31.9%), and 
tetracycline (27.7%), among the strains, wherein 34.0% had MDR phenotypes. 
Meanwhile, most strains were tolerant to heavy metals Cu2+ (96.8%), Cr3+ 
(96.8%), Zn2+ (91.5%), Pb2+ (89.4%), and Hg2+ (81.9%). Remarkably, a higher 
abundance of the bacterium was found in bottom-dwelling aquatic animals, among 
which mollusk Tegillarca granosa contained K. pneumoniae 8-2-5-4 isolate from 
serotype K2 (ST-2026). Genome features of the potentially pathogenic isolate 
were characterized. The enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus 
polymerase chain reaction&amp;nbsp;(ERIC-PCR)-based genome fingerprinting 
classified the 94 K. pneumoniae strains into 76 ERIC genotypes with 63 
singletons, demonstrating considerable genetic diversity in the strains. The 
findings of this study fill the gap in the risk assessment of K. pneumoniae in 
edible aquatic animals."
1542,"Fifty isolates of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were tested for pathogenicity, biofilm 
formation, motility, and antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial activity of 
chitooligosaccharide (COS)-tea polyphenol conjugates against all isolates was 
also studied. Forty-three isolates were randomly selected from 520 isolates from 
Asian green mussel (Perna viridis) grown on CHROMagarTM Vibrio agar plate. Six 
isolates were acquired from stool specimens of diarrhea patients. One laboratory 
strain was V. parahaemolyticus PSU.SCB.16S.14. Among all isolates tested, 12% of 
V. parahaemolyticus carried the tdh+trh- gene and were positive toward Kanagawa 
phenomenon test. All of V. parahaemolyticus isolates could produce biofilm and 
showed relatively strong motile ability. When COS-catechin conjugate (COS-CAT) 
and COS-epigallocatechin-3-gallate conjugate (COS-EGCG) were examined for their 
inhibitory effect against V. parahaemolyticus, the former showed the higher 
bactericidal activity with the MBC value of 1.024 mg/mL against both pathogenic 
and non-pathogenic strains. Most of the representative Asian green mussel V. 
parahaemolyticus isolates exhibited high sensitivity to all antibiotics, whereas 
one isolate showed the intermediate resistance to cefuroxime. However, the 
representative clinical isolates were highly resistant to nine types of 
antibiotics and had multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index of 0.64. Thus, 
COS-CAT could be used as potential antimicrobial agent for controlling V. 
parahaemolyticus-causing disease in Asian green mussel."
1543,"This study was conducted to examine the effect of a mulberry leaf total mixed 
ration (TMR) diet on growth performance, apparent digestibility, meat quality 
and the expression of related meat-quality genes (ADSL, H-FABP) in crossbred 
black goats. Forty-four Guizhou crossbred black goats (Nubian black goat ♂ × 
Guizhou black goat ♀), weighing 33.43 ± 0.55 kg, were chosen. The goats were 
randomly divided into four groups, with 11 test replicates in each group. Group 
I was the control group and fed with the traditional feeding method of roughage 
and concentrate supplement without adding mulberry leaf. Group II was fed with a 
40% mulberry leaf pellet TMR diet. Group III was fed with a freshly processed 
40% mulberry leaf TMR diet. Group IV was fed with a 40% mulberry leaf fermented 
total mixed rations (FTMR) diet. The results showed that the average daily gain 
(ADG) of group II was significantly higher than that of group I and III (p &lt; 
0.05). The apparent digestibility of group II of ether extract (EE) and neutral 
detergent fiber (NDF) was significantly higher than that of group I (p &lt; 
0.05), and the apparent digestibility of dry matter (DM) and crude protein (CP) 
was significantly higher than that of group I (p &lt; 0.01). Compared with group 
I, meat in group II had lower meat color lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) 
values (p &lt; 0.01) in the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum. The shear force of 
group II was significantly lower than that of group I (p &lt; 0.05). The total 
fatty acids (TFA) of group II was significantly higher than that of groups I and 
III (p &lt; 0.05), but the total saturated fatty acids (SFA) of group II was 
significantly lower that than of group I (p &lt; 0.01). Subsequently, the 
Unsaturated fatty acids (USFA), Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and 
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of group II were significantly higher than 
those in group I (p &lt; 0.01). The contents of total amino acids (TAA), total 
essential amino acids (EAA), total non-essential amino acids (NEAA) and total of 
major fresh-tasting amino acids (DAA) of groups II, III and IV were 
significantly higher than those of group I (p &lt; 0.05), as well as the 
contents of IMP (p &lt; 0.01). The expression of the H-FABP gene in the arm 
triceps of group II was significantly higher than that of groups I, III and IV 
(p &lt; 0.05). The expression of the ADSL gene in the Longissimus thoracis et 
lumborum and biceps femoris of group II was significantly higher than that of 
group I (p &lt; 0.05). Collectively, the results of the current study indicated 
that the mulberry leaf TMR diet improved the growth performance, apparent 
digestibility and expression of related meat-quality master genes (ADSL, H-FABP) 
in crossbred black goats, which promoted the deposition of intramuscular fat 
(IMF) and inosinic acid (IMP) and improved the composition of fatty acids and 
amino acids in the muscles."
1544,"The world faces numerous problems and two of them are global food shortages and 
the dwindling number of pollinating insects. Plant products that do not arise 
from pollination are plant galls, which as in the case of oak apples, can 
resemble fruits and be the size of a cherry. It is suggested that once research 
has understood how chemical signals from gall-inducing insects program a plant 
to produce a gall, it should be possible to mimic and to improve nature and 
""bioengineer"" designer galls of different sizes, colorations and specific 
contents to serve as food or a source of medicinally useful compounds. To 
achieve this objective, the genes involved in the formation of the galls need to 
be identified by RNA-sequencing and confirmed by gene expression analyses and 
gene slicing. Ultimately the relevant genes need to be transferred to naïve 
plants, possibly with the aid of plasmids or viruses as practiced in crop 
productivity increases. There is then even the prospect of engineered plant 
galls to be produced by plant tissue culture via genetic manipulation without 
the involvement of insects altogether."
1545,"Persimmons are one of the most important export fruits in South Korea, where 
several tons are exported across the globe each year. In this study, the quality 
attributes of 'Wonmi' persimmon fruits were evaluated during an export 
simulation at 0 °C, 10 °C, and 24 °C with a combination of 1-Methylcyclopropene 
(1-MCP) and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) treatments. The relative 
humidity during the export simulation was greater at room temperature (75-92%) 
and 0 °C (85% to 93%) than at 10 °C (42% to 60%). The results show that the 
application of 1-MCP and MAP treatments during the export simulation were 
effective in delaying the ripening of 'Wonmi' persimmons by reducing respiration 
and ethylene production. The suppressed expression of ethylene synthesis genes 
and cell wall modification genes reduced the ethylene production and maintain 
the fruit firmness, respectively. In addition, 1-MCP and MAP treatments were 
effective in maintaining SSC and color of 'Wonmi' persimmon fruits during the 
export simulation. Thus, by adopting these treatments, the overall quality of 
persimmon exports from South Korea can significantly improve."
1546,"Slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) was prepared and used as wheat 
tempering water. This study explored the impacts of tempering with SAEW on 
microbial load and diversity and quality properties of wheat flour. As SAEW 
volume ratio increased, the residual level of total plate counts (TPC) and 
mould/yeast counts (MYC) decreased dramatically (p &lt; 0.05). Based on genomics 
analysis, bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS1 gene region were performed to 
characterize the changes in microbial communities' composition and diversity in 
response to SAEW treatment. SAEW optimal volume ratio (6.5:10, v/v) of SAEW with 
distilled water influenced wheat microbiome composition, with a higher microbial 
diversity and abundance discovered on the control grains. Bacteroidetes of 
predominant bacterial phylum and Ascomycota of the most abundant fungal phylum 
were reduced after SAEW optimal volume ratio tempering. The flour yield is 
higher and ash content is lower than the control samples. Falling number and 
""b*"" in terms of colour markedly increased. DSC (Differential Scanning 
Calorimetry) test showed that To (onset temperature), Tp (peak temperature), and 
Tc (conclusion temperature) were significantly decreased in thermal 
characteristics of flour. Gluten content, protein content, ΔH and pasting 
properties tests showed no significant change. It can be concluded that SAEW 
should be applied on wheat tempering for producing clean wheat flour. ANOVA and 
Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test were used for the analysis of 
variance and differences between the experimental and control groups, with p 
&lt; 0.05."
1547,"Meat product inspection is one of the procedures adopted more than a century ago 
to guarantee food quality and safety for consumption. Due to technology and 
regulation advancement for farming and slaughtering pigs, a change in zoonotic 
profile attributed to pork has been identified. Thus, a global movement began to 
establish inspection parameters based on epidemiological risk profiles, 
culminating in the publication of a new regulation in Brazil in 2018. This 
normative instruction establishes that slaughterhouses under federal inspection 
must implement risk-based inspection until 2028. Changes in the inspection 
system can generate questions and objections on the part of customers and 
consumer markets. In order to assess microbiological contamination when adopting 
a risk-based inspection system, the occurrence of Salmonella spp. and the 
quantification of Enterobacteriaceae and mesophilic aerobic counts were compared 
in pig carcasses slaughtered under traditional and risk-based inspection 
systems. A statistical significance reduction was identified regarding the 
quantification of Enterobacteriaceae (log -0.18 to -1.61 CFU/cm2) and mesophilic 
aerobic counts (log 4.60 to 3.49 CFU/cm2). The occurrence of Salmonella spp. did 
not show a significant difference (4% to 5.3%). The results allowed us to 
conclude that adopting risk-based inspection systems improves food safety 
through Enterobacteriaceae and mesophilic aerobic counts reduction."
1548,"X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most common hereditary form of rickets 
and deficiency of renal tubular phosphate transport in humans. XLH is caused by 
the inactivation of mutations within the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase 
homolog X-linked (PHEX) gene and follows an X-dominant transmission. It has an 
estimated frequency of 1 case per 20,000, and over 300 distinct pathogenic 
variations have been reported that result in an excess of fibroblast growth 
factor 23 (FGF23) in the serum. Increased levels of FGF23 lead to renal 
phosphate loss, decreased serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and increased 
metabolism of 1,25-dihydoxyvitamin D, resulting in hypophosphatemia. Major 
clinical manifestations include rickets, bone deformities, and growth 
retardation that develop during childhood, and osteomalacia-related fractures or 
pseudo-fractures, degenerative osteoarthritis, enthesopathy, dental anomalies, 
and hearing loss during adulthood, which can affect quality of life. In 
addition, fatigue is also a common symptom in patients with XLH, who experience 
decreased motion, muscle weakness, and pain, contributing to altered quality of 
life. The clinical and biomedical characteristics of XLH are extensively defined 
in bone tissue since skeletal deformations and mineralization defects are the 
most evident effects of high FGF23 and low serum phosphate levels. However, 
despite the muscular symptoms that XLH causes, very few reports are available on 
the effects of FGF23 and phosphate in muscle tissue. Given the close 
relationship between bones and skeletal muscles, studying the effects of FGF23 
and phosphate on muscle could provide additional opportunities to understand the 
interactions between these two important compartments of the body. By describing 
the current literature on XLH and skeletal muscle dysfunctions, the purpose of 
this review is to highlight future areas of research that could contribute to a 
better understanding of XLH muscular disability and its management."
1549,"Rhizoctonia solani is a species complex composed of many genetically diverse 
anastomosis groups (AG) and their subgroups. It causes economically important 
diseases of soybean worldwide. However, the global genetic diversity and 
distribution of R. solani AG associated with soybean are unknown to date. In 
this study, the global genetic diversity and distribution of AG associated with 
soybean were investigated based on rDNA-ITS sequences deposited in GenBank and 
published literature. The most prevalent AG, was AG-1 (40%), followed by AG-2 
(19.13%), AG-4 (11.30%), AG-7 (10.43%), AG-11 (8.70%), AG-3 (5.22%) and AG-5 
(3.48%). Most of the AG were reported from the USA and Brazil. Sequence analysis 
of internal transcribed spacers of ribosomal DNA separated AG associated with 
soybean into two distinct clades. Clade I corresponded to distinct subclades 
containing AG-2, AG-3, AG-5, AG-7 and AG-11. Clade II corresponded to subclades 
of AG-1 subgroups. Furthermore, AG and/or AG subgroups were in close proximity 
without corresponding to their geographical origin. Moreover, AG or AG subgroups 
within clade or subclades shared higher percentages of sequence similarities. 
The principal coordinate analysis also supported the phylogenetic and genetic 
diversity analyses. In conclusion, AG-1, AG-2, and AG-4 were the most prevalent 
AG in soybean. The clade or subclades corresponded to AG or AG subgroups and did 
not correspond to the AG's geographical origin. The information on global 
genetic diversity and distribution will be helpful if novel management measures 
are to be developed against soybean diseases caused by R. solani."
1550,"The Chakouyi horse is an ancient Chinese indigenous horse breed distributed in 
Gansu Province in northwestern China, and is also one of the key breeds 
protected by the government. However, the origin of the Chakouyi horse remains 
unclear. As it is distributed in a key region of the Silk Road, it was 
speculated that the origin of the Chakouyi horse might involve the foreign horse 
breeds found along this ancient commercial artery. In this study, whole-genome 
resequencing data of 12 horse breeds, including both indigenous and foreign 
horses, were applied to reveal the genetic relationships between the Chakouyi 
horse and other breeds, as well as the ancestry of this ancient breed. An 
analysis of the population structure and admixture showed that there is no close 
genetic affinity between the Chakouyi horse and the foreign horses while Chinese 
indigenous horse populations were grouped together in accordance with their 
geographic locations, and the Chakouyi horse showed a closer relationship with 
Kazak horses, Mongolian horses, and Tibetan horses. The results from the 
ancestral composition prediction indicated that the Kazak horse and the 
Mongolian horse might be two ancestors of the Chakouyi horse. Furthermore, the 
genome-wide selection signature analysis revealed that the DMRT3 gene was 
positively selected in the Chakouyi horse and related to the gait trait of the 
breed. Our results provide insights into the native origin of the Chakouyi horse 
and indicate that Kazak and Mongolian horses played important roles in the 
formation of the Chakouyi horse. Genetic communication between the Chakouyi 
horse and other horse populations could be attributed, at least partially, to 
population migrations and trade activities along the ancient commercial routes."
1551,"Using radiogenomics methods, the differences between tumor imaging data and 
genetic data in Chinese and Western breast cancer (BC) patients were analyzed, 
and the correlation between phenotypic data and genetic data was explored. In 
this paper, we analyzed BC patients' image characteristics and transcriptome 
data separately, then correlated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phenotype 
with the transcriptome data through a computational method to develop a 
radiogenomics feature. The data was fed into the designed random forest (RF) 
model, which used the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) as the 
evaluation index. Next, we analyzed the hub genes in the differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) and obtained seven hub genes, which may cause Chinese and 
Western BC patients to behave differently in the clinic. We demonstrated that 
combining relevant genetic data and imaging features could better classify 
Chinese and Western patients than using genes or imaging characteristics alone. 
The AUC values of 0.74, 0.81, and 0.95 were obtained separately using the image 
characteristics, DEGs, and radiogenomics features. We screened SYT4, GABRG2, 
CHGA, SLC6A17, NEUROG2, COL2A1, and MATN4 and found that these genes were 
positively or negatively correlated with certain imaging characteristics. In 
addition, we found that the SLC6A17, NEUROG2, CHGA, and MATN4 genes were 
associated with clinical features."
1552,"Metallothionein (MT) is a multifunctional inducible protein in animals, plants, 
and microorganisms. MT is rich in cysteine residues (10-30%), can combine with 
metal ions, has a low molecular weight, and plays an essential biological role 
in various stages of the growth and development of organisms. Due to its strong 
ability to bind metal ions and scavenge free radicals, metallothionein has been 
used in medicine, health care, and other areas. Zinc is essential for plant 
growth, but excessive zinc (Zn) is bound to poison plants, and cadmium (Cd) is a 
significant environmental pollutant. A high concentration of cadmium can 
significantly affect the growth and development of plants and even lead to plant 
death. In this study, the human metallothionein gene HsMT1L under the control of 
the CaMV 35S constitutive promoter was transformed into tobacco, and the 
tolerance and accumulation capacity of transgenic tobacco plants to Zn and Cd 
were explored. The results showed that the high-level expression of HsMT1L in 
tobacco could significantly enhance the accumulation of Zn2+ and Cd2+ in both 
the aboveground parts and the roots compared to wild-type tobacco plants and 
conferred a greater tolerance to Zn and Cd in transgenic tobacco. Subcellular 
localization showed that HsMT1L was localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm in 
the tobacco. Our study suggests that HsMT1L can be used for the phytoremediation 
of soil for heavy metal removal."
1553,"Clubroot, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, is an economically important 
soil-borne disease that threatens Brassicaceae crops worldwide. In recent years, 
the incidence area of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) clubroot 
disease has increased, which severely affects the yield and quality of Chinese 
cabbage. The resistance of varieties harboring the single clubroot-resistance 
(CR) gene is easily broken through by P. brassicae pathotypes. CRa and CRd, 
genetically identified in B. rapa, are CR genes known to be highly resistant to 
different P. brassicaea pathotypes. In our study, we perform the gene pyramiding 
of CRa and CRd in Chinese cabbages through marker-assisted selection (MAS), and 
develop homozygous pyramided lines. The newly generated pyramided lines exhibit 
greater resistance to six different pathotypes than that of two parental lines 
carrying a single CR gene. This study provides new CR-gene-pyramided lines for 
the development of clubroot-resistant Brassica varieties for future breeding 
programs."
1554,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a frequently chronic kidney pathology derived 
from diabetes comorbidity. This condition has irreversible damage and its risk 
factor increases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prognostic outcome for diabetic 
patients with COVID-19 is dismal, even with intensive medical treatment. 
However, there is still scarce information on critical genes involved in the 
pathophysiological impact of COVID-19 on DKD. Herein, we characterize 
differential expression gene (DEG) profiles and determine hub genes undergoing 
transcriptional reprogramming in both disease conditions. Out of 995 DEGs, we 
identified 42 shared with COVID-19 pathways. Enrichment analysis elucidated that 
they are significantly induced with implications for immune and inflammatory 
responses. By performing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and 
applying topological methods, we determine the following five hub genes: STAT1, 
IRF7, ISG15, MX1 and OAS1. Then, by network deconvolution, we determine their 
co-expressed gene modules. Moreover, we validate the conservancy of their 
upregulation using the Coronascape database (DB). Finally, tissue-specific 
regulation of the five predictive hub genes indicates that OAS1 and MX1 
expression levels are lower in healthy kidney tissue. Altogether, our results 
suggest that these genes could play an essential role in developing severe 
outcomes of COVID-19 in DKD patients."
1555,"Opisthopappus C. Shih is a rare genus of the Asteraceae family native to the 
Taihang Mountains in China. Due to the narrow distribution area, poor 
reproduction ability and human harvesting, Opisthopappus is threatened by 
extinction. However, the limited genetic information within Opisthopappus impede 
understanding of the conservation efforts and bioprospecting. Therefore, in this 
study, we reported the complete chloroplast (cp) genome sequences of two 
Opisthopappus species, including Opisthopappus taihangensis and Opisthopappus 
longilobus. The cp genomes of O. taihangensis and O. longilobus were 151,117 and 
151,123 bp, which contained 88 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA 
genes. The repeat sequences, codon usage, RNA-editing sites, and comparative 
analyses revealed a high degree of conservation between the two species. The 
ycf1 gene was identified as a potential molecular marker. The phylogenetic tree 
demonstrated that O. longilobus was a separate species and not a synonym or 
variety of O. taihangensis. The molecular clock showed that two species diverge 
over a large time span, O. longilobus diverged at 15.24 Mya (Million years ago), 
whereas O. taihangensis diverged at 5.40 Mya We found that Opisthopappus and 
Ajania are closely related, which provides new ideas for the development of 
Opisthopappus. These results provide biological information and an essential 
basis to understand the evolutionary history of the Opisthopappus species, which 
will aid in the future the bioprospecting and conservation of endangered 
species."
1556,"Identification of new, effective disease resistance genes is a very important 
aspect of plant breeding. Also important is the precise location of individual 
loci and tagging them with DNA markers for marker assisted selection. The aim of 
the present study was identification of the molecular markers linked with Pm12, 
a new effective resistance gene to powdery mildew, and their location in the oat 
genome. The analysis was performed on 167 F2 individuals from a hybrid of Fuchs 
× CN67383, with the status of the locus in each individual verified by progeny 
test in F3. Segregation ratios confirmed the monogenic nature of resistance. 
Making use of the sequence data of DNA markers and the oat OT3098 v2 genome 
reference assembly, Pm12 is located on chromosome 7C. A comparison was also made 
with the reference consensus map, to which there are more reports of mapped 
genes to date. The mapping results suggest that Pm12 is located in the interval 
103.8-111.7 cM on this map. No powdery mildew resistance locus has been 
identified in this region so far, suggesting that Avena sterilis CN67383 carries 
a novel locus offering effective resistance in oat breeding. The information 
included in the oat genome annotation allowed for the identification of 
candidate genes in the close region of the marker cluster for Pm12. This 
information may provide an interesting source of further analysis of the 
pathways of various genes in response to the stress of powdery mildew infection."
1557,"Inherited copy number variations (CNVs) can provide valuable information for 
cancer susceptibility and prognosis. However, their association with oropharynx 
squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is still poorly studied. Using microarrays 
analysis, we identified three inherited CNVs associated with OPSCC risk, of 
which one was validated in 152 OPSCC patients and 155 controls and related to 
pseudogene-microRNA-mRNA interaction. Individuals with three or more copies of 
ADAM3A and ADAM5 pseudogenes (8p11.22 chromosome region) were under 6.49-fold 
increased risk of OPSCC. ADAM5 shared a highly homologous sequence with the 
ADAM9 3'-UTR, predicted to be a binding site for miR-122b-5p. Individuals 
carrying more than three copies of ADAM3A and ADAM5 presented higher ADAM9 
expression levels. Moreover, patients with total deletion or one copy of 
pseudogenes and with higher expression of miR-122b-5p presented worse prognoses. 
Our data suggest, for the first time, that ADAM3A and ADAM5 pseudogene-inherited 
CNV could modulate OPSCC occurrence and prognosis, possibly through the 
interaction of ADAM5 pseudogene transcript, miR-122b-5p, and ADAM9."
1558,"Recent studies have suggested an association between obesity and dyslipidemia in 
the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The purpose of this study was to 
explore the causal effects of obesity and dyslipidemia on T2D risk in Asians. 
Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to assess 
genetically predicted obesity using body mass index (BMI) and dyslipidemia using 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL), total cholesterol (TCHL), and triglycerides (TG) versus T2D 
susceptibility using genome-wide association study (GWAS) results derived from 
the summary statistics of Biobank Japan (n = 179,000) and DIAbetes Meta-ANalysis 
of Trans-Ethnic association studies (n = 50,533). The MR analysis demonstrated 
evidence of a causal effect of higher BMI on the risk of T2D (odds ratio (OR) 
&gt; 1.0, p &lt; 0.05). In addition, TG showed a protective effect on the risk 
of T2D (ORs 0.68-0.85). However, HDL, LDL, and TCHL showed little genetic 
evidence supporting a causal association between dyslipidemia and T2D. We found 
strong genetic evidence supporting a causal association of BMI with T2D. 
Although HDL, LDL, and TCHL did not show a causal association with T2D, TG had a 
causal relationship with the decrease of T2D. Although it was predicted that TG 
would be linked to a higher risk of T2D, it actually exhibited a paradoxical 
protective effect against T2D, which requires further investigation."
1559,"Feed efficiency (FE) is a very important trait affecting the economic benefits 
of pig breeding enterprises. Adipose tissue can modulate a variety of processes 
such as feed intake, energy metabolism and systemic physiological processes. 
However, the mechanism by which microRNAs (miRNAs) in adipose tissues regulate 
FE remains largely unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to screen potential 
miRNAs related to FE through miRNA sequencing. The miRNA profiles in porcine 
adipose tissues were obtained and 14 miRNAs were identified differentially 
expressed in adipose tissues of pigs with extreme differences in FE, of which 9 
were down-regulated and 5 were up-regulated. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that 
these miRNAs were significantly related to lipid metabolism and these miRNAs 
modulated FE by regulating lipid metabolism. Subsequently, quantitative reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of five randomly selected DEMs 
was used to verify the reliability of miRNA-seq data. Furthermore, 39 
differentially expressed target genes of these DEMs were obtained, and 
DEMs-target mRNA interaction networks were constructed. In addition, the most 
significantly down-regulated miRNAs, ssc-miR-122-5p and ssc-miR-192, might be 
the key miRNAs for FE. Our results reveal the mechanism by which adipose miRNAs 
regulate feed efficiency in pigs. This study provides a theoretical basis for 
the further study of swine feed efficiency improvement."
1560,"Long-haired individuals in the Tianzhu white yak population are a unique genetic 
resource, and have important landscape value. Copy number variation (CNV) is an 
important source of phenotypic variation in mammals. In this study, we used 
resequencing technology to detect the whole genome of 10 long-haired Tianzhu 
white yaks (LTWY) and 10 normal-haired Tianzhu white yaks (NTWY), and analyzed 
the differences of CNV in the genome of LTWYs and NTWYs. A total of 110268 CNVs 
were identified, 2006 CNVRs were defined, and the distribution map of these 
CNVRs on chromosomes was constructed. The comparison of LTWYs and NTWYs 
identified 80 differential CNVR-harbored genes, which were enriched in lipid 
metabolism, cell migration and other functions. Notably, some differential genes 
were identified as associated with hair growth and hair-follicle development 
(e.g., ASTN2, ATM, COL22A1, GK5, SLIT3, PM20D1, and SGCZ). In general, we 
present the first genome-wide analysis of CNV in LTWYs and NTWYs. Our results 
can provide new insights into the phenotypic variation of different hair lengths 
in Tianzhu white yaks."
1561,"Pyracantha fortuneana (Maxim.) Li (Rosaceae), commonly known as Chinese 
firethorn, is an evergreen shrub with high nutritional, medicinal, and 
horticultural importance. This species typically has white flowers, but a rare 
red flower phenotype has been found in very few wild populations in western 
Hubei, China, showing great ornamental potential. In this study, the complete 
chloroplast genome of the red flower phenotype of P. fortuneana was reported for 
the first time, using high-throughput sequencing technology. The complete 
chloroplast genome was 160,361 bp in length and showed a typical quadripartite 
structure with a pair of inverted repeat (IR) regions (26,350 bp) separated by a 
large single-copy (LSC) region (88,316 bp) and a small single-copy (SSC) region 
(19,345 bp). A total of 131 functional genes were annotated in this chloroplast 
genome, including 86 protein-coding genes (PCGs), eight rRNA genes, and 37 tRNA 
genes. Comparative chloroplast genome analyses revealed that high genome 
similarity existed not only between red and white flower phenotypes of P. 
fortuneana, but also among Pyracantha species. No evidence for positive 
selection was found in any PCG, suggesting the evolutionary conservation of 
Pyracantha chloroplast genomes. Furthermore, four mutational hotspots 
(trnG-trnR-atpA, psbZ-trnG-trnfM-rps14, ycf3-trnS-rps4, and ndhF-rpl32) with π 
&gt; 0.004 were identified as potential molecular markers for Pyracantha 
species. Phylogenomic analysis strongly supported that the red flower phenotype 
of P. fortuneana was nested within the common white flower phenotype. Based on 
both morphological and molecular evidence, we suggest that the red flower 
phenotype of P. fortuneana could be considered as a new forma. Overall, the 
availability of these genetic resources will not only offer valuable information 
for further studies on molecular taxonomy, phylogeny, and population genetics of 
Pyracantha species but also could be used as potential genetic resources for 
Chinese firethorn breeding."
1562,"Epistatic interactions are referred to as SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) 
that affect disease development and trait expression nonlinearly, and hence 
identifying epistatic interactions plays a great role in explaining the 
pathogenesis and genetic heterogeneity of complex diseases. Many methods have 
been proposed for epistasis detection; nevertheless, they mainly focus on 
low-order epistatic interactions, two-order or three-order for instance, and 
often ignore high-order interactions due to computational burden. In this paper, 
a module detection method called MDSN is proposed for identifying high-order 
epistatic interactions. First, an SNP network is constructed by a construction 
strategy of interaction complementary, which consists of low-order SNP 
interactions that can be obtained from fast computations. Then, a node 
evaluation measure that integrates multi-topological features is proposed to 
improve the node expansion algorithm, where the importance of a node is 
comprehensively evaluated by the topological characteristics of the 
neighborhood. Finally, modules are detected in the constructed SNP network, 
which have high-order epistatic interactions associated with the disease. The 
MDSN was compared with four state-of-the-art methods on simulation datasets and 
a real Age-related Macular Degeneration dataset. The results demonstrate that 
MDSN has higher performance on detecting high-order interactions."
1563,"Machilus chuanchienensis is an ecological tree distributed in southwestern 
China. It has a significant valuation with making Hawk tea using its leaves, an 
ethnic traditional tea-like beverage with a long history in Chinese tea culture. 
The whole chloroplast (cp) genome is an ideal model for the phylogenetic study 
of Lauraceae because of its simple structure and highly conserved features. 
There have been numerous reports of complete cp genome sequences in Lauraceae, 
but little is known about M. chuanchienensis. Here, the next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) was used to sequence the M. chuanchienensis cp genome. Then, a 
comprehensive comparative genome analysis was performed. The results revealed 
that the M. chuanchienensis's cp genome measured 152,748 base pairs (bp) with a 
GC content of 39.15% and coded 126 genes annotated, including comprising eight 
ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 36 transporter RNA (tRNA), and 82 protein-coding genes. In 
addition, the cp genome presented a typical quadripartite structure comprising a 
large single-copy (LSC; 93,811) region, a small single-copy (SSC; 18,803) 
region, and the inverted repeats (IRs; 20,067) region and contained 92 simple 
sequence repeat (SSR) locus in total. Phylogenetic relationships of 37 species 
indicated that M. chuanchienensis was a sister to M. balansae, M. melanophylla, 
and M. minutiflora. Further research on this crucial species may benefit 
significantly from these findings."
1564,"AIM: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a group of T-cell malignancies that 
develop in the skin. Though studied intensively, the etiology and pathogenesis 
of CTCL remain elusive. This study evaluated the survival of CTCL patients in 
the 1st Department of Dermatovenereology of St. Anne's University Hospital Brno. 
It included analysis of 19 polymorphic gene variants based on their expected 
involvement in CTCL severity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 75 patients with CTCL, evaluated and treated at the 1st 
Department of Dermatovenereology of St. Anne´s University Hospital Brno, Faculty 
of Medicine, Masaryk University, were recruited for the study over the last 28 
years (44 men and 31 women, average age 58 years, range 20-82 years). All 
patients were genotyped for 19 chosen gene polymorphisms by the conventional PCR 
method with restriction analysis. A multivariate Cox regression model was 
calculated to reveal genetic polymorphisms and other risk factors for survival.
RESULTS: The model identified MDR Ex21 2677 (rs2032582) as a significant genetic 
factor influencing the survival of the patients, with the T-allele playing a 
protective role. A multivariate stepwise Cox regression model confirmed the 
following as significant independent risk factors for overall survival: 
increased age at admission, clinical staging of the tumor, and male sex.
CONCLUSION: We showed that the TT genotype at position 2677 of the MDR1 gene 
exhibited statistically significant longer survival in CTCL patients. As such, 
the TT genotype of MDR1 confers a significant advantage for the CTCL patients 
who respond to treatment."
1565,"Understanding the causes of tumorigenesis and progression in triple-receptor 
negative breast cancer (TNBC) can help the design of novel and personalized 
therapies and prognostic assessments. Abnormal RNA modification is a recently 
discovered process in TNBC development. TNBC samples from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas database were categorized according to the expression level of NAT10, 
which drives acetylation of cytidine in RNA to N(4)-acetylcytidine (ac4C) and 
affects mRNA stability. A total of 703 differentially expressed long non-coding 
RNAs (lncRNAs) were found between high- and low-expressed NAT10 groups in TNBC. 
Twenty of these lncRNAs were significantly associated with prognosis. Two breast 
cancer tissues and their paired normal tissues were sequenced at the whole 
genome level using acetylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (acRIP-seq) 
technology to identify acetylation features in TNBC, and 180 genes were 
significantly differentially ac4c acetylated in patients. We also analyzed the 
genome-wide lncRNA expression profile and constructed a co-expression network, 
containing 116 ac4C genes and 1080 lncRNAs. Three of these lncRNAs were 
prognostic risk lncRNAs affected by NAT10 and contained in the network. The 
corresponding reciprocal pairs were ""LINC01614-COL3A1"", ""OIP5-AS1-USP8"", and 
""RP5-908M14.9-TRIR"". These results indicate that RNA ac4c acetylation involves 
lncRNAs and affects the tumor process and prognosis of TNBC. This will aid the 
prediction of drug targets and drug sensitivity."
1566,"Background: The fragile X premutation carrier state (PM) (55-200 CGG repeats in 
the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1, FMR1 gene) is associated with 
several conditions, including fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency 
(FXPOI) and fragile X-associated tremor ataxia (FXTAS), with current literature 
largely primarily investigating older PM individuals. The aim of this study was 
to identify the prevalence of fragile X-associated neurodevelopmental disorders 
(FXAND) in a sample of young PM individuals. Methods: This was a retrospective 
study conducted through a medical record review of PM individuals who were seen 
either for clinical concerns (probands, 45.9%) or identified through the cascade 
testing (non-probands, 54.1%) of an affected sibling with fragile X syndrome. 
Information on the presence of autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, long-term psychiatric medication 
intake, and cognitive function, based on standardized assessments, was obtained. 
Molecular data, including CGG repeat number and FMR1 mRNA levels, were also 
available for a subset of participants. Analysis included descriptive statistics 
and a test of comparison to describe the clinical profile of PM individuals 
pertinent to FXAND. Results: Participants included 61 individuals (52 males and 
9 females) aged 7.8 to 20.0 years (mean 12.6 ± 3.4) with a mean full-scale IQ of 
90.9 ± 22.7. The majority (N = 52; 85.2%) had at least one mental health 
disorder, with anxiety being the most common (82.0% of subjects), followed by 
ADHD (66.5%), and ASD (32.8%). Twenty-seven (87.1%) of non-probands also had at 
least one mental health condition, with probands having lower cognitive and 
adaptive skills than non-probands. ASD was present in 20 participants (17/52 
males and 3/9 females; 15 probands) with significantly lower FSIQ in those with 
ASD (mean 73.5 vs. 98.0, p &lt; 0.001). Participants with ASD had a higher 
number of long-term medications compared to those without (2.32 vs. 1.3, p = 
0.002). Conclusions: Our findings indicate a high rate of FXAND diagnoses within 
a cohort of young PM individuals, including those identified via cascade 
testing, although this was not a population sample. An awareness of the entity 
of FXAND and the early recognition of the symptoms of associated conditions may 
facilitate timely and appropriate care for PM individuals."
1567,"Zinc (Zn)-regulated and iron (Fe)-regulated transporter-like proteins (ZIP) are 
key players involved in the accumulation of cadmium (Cd) and Zn in plants. Sedum 
plumbizincicola X.H. Guo et S.B. Zhou ex L.H. Wu (S. plumbizincicola) is a 
Crassulaceae Cd/Zn hyperaccumulator found in China, but the role of ZIPs in S. 
plumbizincicola remains largely unexplored. Here, we identified 12 members of 
ZIP family genes by transcriptome analysis in S. plumbizincicola and cloned the 
SpZIP2 gene with functional analysis. The expression of SpZIP2 in roots was 
higher than that in the shoots, and Cd stress significantly decreased its 
expression in the roots but increased its expression in leaves. Protein sequence 
characteristics and structural analysis showed that the content of alanine and 
leucine residues in the SpZIP2 sequence was higher than other residues, and 
several serine, threonine and tyrosine sites can be phosphorylated. 
Transmembrane domain analysis showed that SpZIP2 has the classic eight 
transmembrane regions. The evolutionary analysis found that SpZIP2 is closely 
related to OsZIP2, followed by AtZIP11, OsZIP1 and AtZIP2. Sequence alignment 
showed that most of the conserved sequences among these members were located in 
the transmembrane regions. A further metal sensitivity assay using yeast mutant 
Δyap1 showed that the expression of SpZIP2 increased the sensitivity of the 
transformants to Cd but failed to change the resistance to Zn. The subsequent 
ion content determination showed that the expression of SpZIP2 increased the 
accumulation of Cd in yeast. Subcellular localization showed that SpZIP2 was 
localized to membrane systems, including the plasma membrane and endoplasmic 
reticulum. The above results indicate that ZIP member SpZIP2 participates in the 
uptake and accumulation of Cd into cells and might contribute to Cd 
hyperaccumulation in S. plumbizincicola."
1568,"The Tibetan pig is an endemic economic animal in the plateau region of China, 
and has a unique adaptation mechanism to the plateau hypoxic environment. 
Research into microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the mechanism underlying hypoxia 
adaptation of Tibetan pig is very limited. Therefore, we isolated alveolar type 
II epithelial (ATII) cells from the lungs of the Tibetan pig, cultured them in 
normoxia/hypoxia (21% O2; 2% O2) for 48 h, and performed high-throughput 
sequencing analysis. We identified a hypoxic stress-related ssc-miR-141 and 
predicted its target genes. The target genes of ssc-miR-141 were mainly enriched 
in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), autophagy-animal, and Ras signaling 
pathways. Further, we confirmed that PDCD4 may serve as the target gene of 
ssc-miR-141. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis 
was performed to confirm the expression levels of ssc-miR-141 and PDCD4, and a 
dual-luciferase gene reporter system was used to verify the targeted linkage of 
ssc-miR-141 to PDCD4. The results showed that the expression level of 
ssc-miR-141 in the hypoxia group was higher than that in the normoxia group, 
while the expression level of PDCD4 tended to show the opposite trend and 
significantly decreased under hypoxia. These findings suggest that ssc-miR-141 
is associated with hypoxia adaptation and provide a new insight into the role of 
miRNAs from ATII cells of Tibetan pig in hypoxia adaptation."
1569,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a range of motor signs, but 
cognitive dysfunction is also observed. Supplementation with folic acid and 
vitamin B12 is expected to prevent cognitive impairment. To test this in PD, we 
promoted a lesion within the substantia nigra pars compacta of rats using the 
neurotoxin rotenone. In the sequence, the animals were supplemented with folic 
acid and vitamin B12 for 14 consecutive days and subjected to the object 
recognition test. We observed an impairment in object recognition memory after 
rotenone administration, which was prevented by supplementation (p &lt; 0.01). 
Supplementation may adjust gene expression through efficient DNA methylation. To 
verify this, we measured the expression and methylation of the kynureninase gene 
(Kynu), whose product metabolizes neurotoxic metabolites often accumulated in PD 
as kynurenine. Supplementation prevented the decrease in Kynu expression induced 
by rotenone in the substantia nigra (p &lt; 0.05), corroborating the behavioral 
data. No differences were observed concerning the methylation analysis of two 
CpG sites in the Kynu promoter. Instead, we suggest that folic acid and vitamin 
B12 increased global DNA methylation, reduced the expression of Kynu inhibitors, 
maintained Kynu-dependent pathway homeostasis, and prevented the memory 
impairment induced by rotenone. Our study raises the possibility of adjuvant 
therapy for PD with folic acid and vitamin B12."
1570,"Toxicodendron succedaneum (L.) Kuntze (T. succedaneum) is an economic tree 
species that produces urushiol and urushi wax, and it is of great value in 
industry and medicine. However, the stability of reference genes (RGs) has not 
been systematically reported in T. succedaneum to date. In this study, the 
expression of 10 candidate RGs was analyzed by RT-qPCR in different tissues 
(roots, stems, leaves), stress treatments (high/low temperature, drought), and 
hormone stimulation (jasmonic acid, JA). Then, the stability ranking of 10 
candidate genes was evaluated by ∆Ct analysis and three software programs: 
geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. Finally, RefFinder was used to 
comprehensively analyze the expression stability of 10 candidate genes. The 
comprehensive analysis showed that TsRG05/06, TsRG01/06, and TsRG03/ACT were 
stable under high/low-temperature stress, drought stress, and JA treatment, 
respectively. TsRG03 and ACT had stable expression in different tissues. While 
the TsRG03 and ACT were recommended as the suitable RGs for T. succedaneum in 
all samples. Meanwhile, UBQ was the least suitable as a reference gene for T. 
succedaneum. In addition, the results of geNorm showed that the combination of 
two stable RGs could make the results of gene expression more accurate. These 
results provide alternative RGs for the study of gene function, correction, and 
normalization of target gene expression and directed molecular breeding in T. 
succedaneum."
1571,"Common bean is one of the most important legume crops for human consumption. Its 
yield is adversely affected by environmental stress. Plant non-specific lipid 
transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are essential for plant growth, development, and 
resistance to abiotic stress, such as salt, drought, and alkali. However, 
changes in nsLTP family genes responding to drought stress are less known. The 
PvLTP gene family in the common bean was identified by a comprehensive 
genome-wide analysis. Molecular weights, theoretical isoelectric points, 
phylogenetic tree, conserved motifs, gene structures, gene duplications, 
chromosome localization, and expression profiles were analyzed by SignalP 5.0, 
ExPASy, ClustalX 2.1, MEGA 7.0, NCBI-CDD, MEME, Weblogo, and TBtools 1.09876, 
respectively. Heatmap and qRT-PCR analyses were performed to validate the 
expression profiles of PvLTP genes in different organs. In addition, the 
expression patterns of nine PvLTP genes in common beans treated with drought 
stress were investigated by qRT-PCR. We obtained 58 putative PvLTP genes in the 
common bean genome via genome-wide analyses. Based on the diversity of the 
eight-cysteine motif (ECM), these genes were categorized into five types (I, II, 
IV, V, and VIII). The signal peptides of the PvLTP precursors were predicted to 
be from 16 to 42 amino acid residues. PvLTPs had a predicated theoretical 
isoelectric point of 3.94-10.34 and a molecular weight of 7.15-12.17 kDa. The 
phylogenetic analysis showed that PvLTPs were closer to AtLTPs than OsLTPs. 
Conserved motif and gene structure analyses indicated that PvLTPs were randomly 
distributed on all chromosomes except chromosome 9. In addition, 23 tandem 
duplicates of PvLTP genes were arranged in 10 gene clusters on chromosomes 1 and 
2. The heatmap and qRT-PCR showed that PvLTP expression significantly varied in 
different tissues. Moreover, 9 PvLTP genes were up-regulated under drought 
treatment. Our results reveal that PvLTPs play potentially vital roles in plants 
and provide a comprehensive reference for studies on PvLTP genes and a 
theoretical basis for further analysis of regulatory mechanisms influencing 
drought tolerance in the common bean."
1572,"While the role of common genetic variants in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been 
elucidated in large genome-wide association studies, the contribution of rare 
variants to the disease remains unclear. Herein, a whole-genome sequencing study 
in four affected and four healthy relatives of a consanguineous Italian family 
identified a novel missense c.1801T &gt; C (p.S601P) variant in the GRAMD1B gene 
that is shared within MS cases and resides under a linkage peak (LOD: 2.194). 
Sequencing GRAMD1B in 91 familial MS cases revealed two additional rare missense 
and two splice-site variants, two of which (rs755488531 and rs769527838) were 
not found in 1000 Italian healthy controls. Functional studies demonstrated that 
GRAMD1B, a gene with unknown function in the central nervous system (CNS), is 
expressed by several cell types, including astrocytes, microglia and neurons as 
well as by peripheral monocytes and macrophages. Notably, GRAMD1B was 
downregulated in vessel-associated astrocytes of active MS lesions in autopsied 
brains and by inflammatory stimuli in peripheral monocytes, suggesting a 
possible role in the modulation of inflammatory response and disease 
pathophysiology."
1573,"With the development of high-throughput sequencing, RNA sequencing has been 
widely used in the identification of candidate genes for complex traits in 
livestock, and the functional genes and mutations with large genetic effects on 
milk production traits can provide molecular information for marker-assisted 
selection to increase the selection accuracy and accelerate genetic gain in 
dairy cattle. Our previous study on the liver transcriptome of Holstein cows 
found that acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADVL) and interferon regulatory factor 6 
(IRF6) are differentially expressed between dry and peak lactation periods, as 
well as that they are involved in lipid metabolism and the proliferation and 
differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. Thus, the two genes were considered 
candidates for milk traits. Hence, this study further collected 1186 Holstein 
cows from 110 sire families to investigate their genetic associations with milk 
yield and composition traits. By resequencing the entire exons and 2000 bp of 
the 5' and 3' flanking regions of the two genes, we identified eight SNPs in 
ACADVL and eight SNPs in IRF6. Subsequent single-locus association analyses 
showed that the eight SNPs in ACADVL were all significantly associated with milk 
fat yield, fat percentage, and protein yield (p values ≤ 0.0001-0.0414), and the 
eight SNPs in IRF6 were associated with milk, fat, and protein yields in the 
first or second lactation (p values ≤ 0.0001-0.0467). Using Haploview 4.2, one 
haplotype block with eight of the SNPs in ACADVL (D' = 0.99-1.00) and two 
haplotype blocks in IRF6 with three of the SNPs in each were observed (D' = 
0.98-1.00). Similarly, the haplotype combinations of ACADVL were significantly 
associated with milk yield, fat percentage, fat yield, and protein yield in the 
two lactations (p values ≤ 0.0001-0.0125), and those of IRF6 were associated 
with five milk traits (p values ≤ 0.0001-0.0263). Furthermore, with the JASPAR 
software, it was predicted that the SNPs 19:g.26933503T&gt;C in ACADVL and 
16:g.73501985G&gt;A in IRF6 changed the transcription factor binding sites of 
ZEB1, PLAGL2, and RHOXF1, implying their impacts on the expressions of the 
corresponding genes. Our findings demonstrated that the ACADVL and IRF6 genes 
have significant genetic effects on milk yield and composition traits, and the 
valuable SNPs might be used as genetic markers for genomic selection programs in 
dairy cattle."
1574,"Given the significant role the heat shock protein Hsp70 plays in modulating 
cellular homeostasis in several chronic inflammatory disorders, the genetic 
variation of the inducible HSP70 (HSPA1B) gene may impact protein expression and 
disease phenotype. The HSPA1B rs2763979 variant has been associated with 
multiple inflammatory scenarios, but no previous studies have explored its 
association with asthma. In this sense, this cross-sectional study enrolled 90 
children with asthma and 218 age-/sex-matched healthy volunteers for rs2763979 
variant genotyping by TaqMan allelic discrimination analysis. The results were 
investigated under several genetic models and associated with disease 
susceptibility and clinicolaboratory data. Overall analysis, including the 308 
participants, revealed a higher C allele frequency among patients relative to 
controls (43.0% vs. 33%, p = 0.006). Furthermore, patients with the C variant 
initially had a higher risk of asthma under heterozygous (OR = 2.75, 95%CI = 
1.46-5.18, p = 0.003), homozygous (OR = 3.35, 95%CI = 1.19-9.39, p = 0.008), 
dominant (OR = 2.83, 95%CI = 1.52-5.25, p &lt; 0.001), and overdominant (OR = 
2.12, 95%CI = 1.20-3.74, p = 0.008) models. However, after employing a 1:1 
nearest propensity matching analysis, the studied variant showed only borderline 
significance with asthma under the dominant model in 71 matched cohorts. 
Interestingly, patients who carry the rs2763979 CC genotype showed favorable 
spirometric parameters in terms of better (mean ± SD) forced vital capacity 
(86.3 ± 7.4 vs. 77.7 ± 6.1 and 75.7 ± 7.2 for CT and TT, respectively, p = 
0.021), forced expiratory volume in one second before bronchodilation (60.7 ± 
12.9 vs. 54.9 ± 7.6 and 56.1 ± 7.5 for CT and TT, respectively, p = 0.021), and 
an improvement in peak expiratory flow rate after inhaled salbutamol 
bronchodilator (p = 0.044) relative to the counterpart genotypes. In conclusion, 
the HSPA1B rs2763979 variant might have prognostic utility as a genetic marker 
for asthma in our population. Further larger studies on different ethnicities 
are recommended to validate the results."
1575,"Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are toxic lesions that can be generated by exposure 
to genotoxic agents or during physiological processes, such as during V(D)J 
recombination. The repair of these DSBs is crucial to prevent genomic 
instability and to maintain cellular homeostasis. Two main pathways participate 
in repairing DSBs, namely, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous 
recombination (HR). The P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) plays a pivotal role in 
the choice of DSB repair mechanism, promotes checkpoint activation and preserves 
genome stability upon DSBs. By preventing DSB end resection, 53BP1 promotes NHEJ 
over HR. Nonetheless, the balance between DSB repair pathways remains crucial, 
as unscheduled NHEJ or HR events at different phases of the cell cycle may lead 
to genomic instability. Therefore, the recruitment of 53BP1 to chromatin is 
tightly regulated and has been widely studied. However, less is known about the 
mechanism regulating 53BP1 recruitment at a distance from the DNA damage. The 
present review focuses on the mechanism of 53BP1 recruitment to damage and on

1576,"The scope of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing was expanded to the genome, which 
allowed screening for rare chromosome anomalies (RCAs). Since the efficiency of 
the test for RCAs remains below the common aneuploidies, there is a debate on 
the usage of expanded tests. This study focuses on the confirmatory and 
follow-up data of cases with positive cfDNA testing for RCAs and cases with 
screen-negative results in a series of 912 consecutive cases that underwent 
invasive testing following cfDNA testing. Chorion villus sampling (CVS), 
amniocentesis (AS), fetal blood sampling, and term placenta samples were 
investigated using classical cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic techniques. 
Out of 593 screen-positive results, 504 (85%) were for common aneuploidies, 40 
(6.7%) for rare autosomal trisomies (RATs), and 49 (8.3%) for structural 
chromosome anomalies (SAs). Of the screen-positives for RATs, 20 cases were 
evaluated only in fetal tissue, and confined placental mosaicism (CPM) could not 
be excluded. Among cases with definitive results (n = 20), the rates of true 
positives, placental mosaics, and false positives were 35%, 45%, and 10%, 
respectively. Among screen-positives for SAs, 32.7% were true positives. The 
confirmation rate was higher for duplications than deletions (58.3% vs. 29.4%). 
The rate of chromosomal abnormality was 10.9% in the group of 256 
screen-negatives with pathological ultrasound findings. This study provides 
further data to assess the efficiency of expanded cfDNA testing for RATs and 
SAs. The test efficiency for cfDNA seems to be higher for duplications than for 
deletions, which is evidence of the role of expert ultrasound in identifying 
pregnancies at increased risk for chromosome anomalies, even in pregnancies with 
screen-negatives. Furthermore, we discussed the efficiency of CVS vs. AC in 
screen-positives for RATs."
1577,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease with periods of 
exacerbation and remission of the disease. The etiology of IBD is not fully 
understood. Many studies point to the presence of genetic, immunological, 
environmental, and microbiological factors and the interactions between them in 
the occurrence of IBD. The review looks at genetic factors in the context of 
both IBD predisposition and pharmacogenetics."
1578,"Successful detection of the first SARS-CoV-2 cases using the real-time 
polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) method reflects the power and 
usefulness of this technique. Real-time PCR is a variation of the PCR assay to 
allow monitoring of the PCR progress in actual time. PCR itself is a molecular 
process used to enzymatically synthesize copies in multiple amounts of a 
selected DNA region for various purposes. Real-time PCR is currently one of the 
most powerful molecular approaches and is widely used in biological sciences and 
medicine because it is quantitative, accurate, sensitive, and rapid. Current 
applications of real-time PCR include gene expression analysis, mutation 
detection, detection and quantification of pathogens, detection of genetically 
modified organisms, detection of allergens, monitoring of microbial degradation, 
species identification, and determination of parasite fitness. The technique has 
been used as a gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Modifications of the 
standard real-time PCR methods have also been developed for particular 
applications. This review aims to provide an overview of the current 
applications of the real-time PCR technique, including its role in detecting 
emerging viruses such as SARS-CoV-2."
1579,"The structurally and genetically distinct sigma-1 receptor (S1R) and sigma-2 
receptor (S2R) comprise a unique class of drug binding sites. Their alleles are 
associated with human diseases involving neuronal systems, such as age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) characterized by photoreceptor and retinal pigment 
epithelium (RPE) atrophy. Previous studies have suggested neuroprotective 
benefits for the brain and retina from pharmacological modulation of S1R and/or 
S2R. However, the effect of such modulation on AMD pathology remains 
underexplored. Here, we evaluated S1R- or S2R-selective modulation in an 
AMD-related model of Abca4-/-Rdh8-/- mice with a disrupted visual cycle that 
predisposes RPE and photoreceptors to illumination-induced damage. For S1R 
modulation, we used (+)-pentazocine, which is a high-affinity S1R-selective 
drug. For S2R modulation, we chose CM398, a high-affinity and highly 
S2R-selective ligand with drug-like properties. Abca4-/-Rdh8-/- mice received a 
single i.p. injection of (+)-pentazocine or CM398 or vehicle 30 min before 
illumination. Pretreatment with (+)-pentazocine improved electroretinogram a- 
and b-waves compared to that with vehicle. Consistently, in another AMD-related 
mouse model induced by tail-vein injected NaIO3, S1R genetic ablation aggravated 
photoreceptor loss. In Abca4-/-Rdh8-/- mice, pretreatment with CM398 appeared to 
partially avert illumination-induced photoreceptor loss and autofluorescent 
granule formation that signals RPE damage, as revealed by optical coherence 
tomography. Thus, this study using AMD-related models provides evidence of 
photoreceptor protection afforded by selective modulation of S1R or S2R."
1580,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with autosomal 
dominant inheritance caused by glutamine expansion in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). 
Striatal projection neurons (SPNs) in HD are more vulnerable to cell death. The 
executive striatal population is directly connected with the Brodmann Area 
(BA9), which is mainly involved in motor functions. Analyzing the disease 
samples from BA9 from the SRA database provides insights related to neuron 
degeneration, which helps to identify a promising therapeutic strategy. Most 
gene expression studies examine the changes in expression and associated 
biological functions. In this study, we elucidate the relationship between 
variants and their effect on gene/downstream transcript expression. We computed 
gene and transcript abundance and identified variants from RNA-seq data using 
various pipelines. We predicted the effect of genome-wide association studies 
(GWAS)/novel variants on regulatory functions. We found that many variants 
affect the histone acetylation pattern in HD, thereby perturbing the 
transcription factor networks. Interestingly, some variants affect miRNA binding 
as well as their downstream gene expression. Tissue-specific network analysis 
showed that mitochondrial, neuroinflammation, vasculature, and 
angiogenesis-related genes are disrupted in HD. From this integrative omics 
analysis, we propose that abnormal neuroinflammation acts as a two-edged sword 
that indirectly affects the vasculature and associated energy metabolism. 
Rehabilitation of blood-brain barrier functionality and energy metabolism may 
secure the neuron from cell death."
1581,"Metamorphosis is a critical process in the transition from planktonic life to 
benthic life for marine invertebrates, which is accompanied by a large amount of 
energy consumption. Previous studies have proved that AMP-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK), as a vital energy regulator, plays a prominent role in mediating 
the growth and development of terrestrial animals. However, its function in the 
growth and development of marine invertebrates, especially in metamorphosis, 
remains elusive. This study explored the function of AMPK in the larval 
metamorphosis of Mytilus coruscus. The full-length cDNA of AMPK genes in M. 
coruscus was cloned and characterized, which is composed of three subunits, 
McAMPKα, McAMPKβ, and McAMPKγ. Pharmacological tests demonstrated that through 
the application of an AMPK activator, AMP substantially enhanced the larval 
metamorphosis rate (p &lt; 0.05). By contrast, the larval metamorphosis rate 
decreased significantly after being treated with the AMPK inhibitor Compound C 
(p &lt; 0.05). McAMPK gene knock-down resulted in a reduction in McAMPK gene 
expression (p &lt; 0.05), and the larval metamorphosis of M. coruscus was 
significantly restrained (p &lt; 0.05). These results indicated that AMPK 
signaling is vital in the larval metamorphosis of M. coruscus, which advances 
further understanding in exploring the molecular mechanisms in the metamorphosis 
of marine invertebrate larvae."
1582,"Castanopsis hystrix is a valuable native, broad-leaved, and fast-growing tree in 
South China. In this study, 15 phenotypic traits and 32 simple sequence repeat 
(SSR) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and population structure 
of a natural population of C. hystrix and to construct a core germplasm 
collection by a set of 232 accessions. The results showed that the original 
population of C. hystrix had relatively high genetic diversity, with the number 
of alleles (Na), effective number of alleles (Ne), observed heterozygosity (Ho), 
expected heterozygosity (He), Shannon's information index (I), and polymorphism 
information content (PIC) averaging at 26.188, 11.565, 0.863, 0.897, 2.660, and 
0.889, respectively. Three sub-populations were identified based on a STRUCTURE 
analysis, indicating a strong genetic structure. The results from the 
phylogenetic and population structures showed a high level of agreement, with 
232 germplasms being classified into three main groups. The analysis of 
molecular variance (AMOVA) test indicated that 96% of the total variance was 
derived from within populations, which revealed a low differentiation among 
populations. A core collection composed of 157 germplasms was firstly 
constructed thereafter, of which the diversity parameters non-significantly 
differed from the original population. These results revealed the genetic 
diversity and population structure of C. hystrix germplasms, which have 
implications for germplasm management and genome-wide association studies on C. 
hystrix, as well as for core collection establishment applications in other 
wood-producing hardwood species."
1583,"The appropriate deployment of developmental programs depends on complex genetic 
information encoded by genomic DNA sequences and their positioning and contacts 
in the three-dimensional (3D) space within the nucleus. Current studies using 
novel techniques including, but not limited to, Hi-C, ChIA-PET, and Hi-ChIP 
reveal that regulatory elements (Res), such as enhancers and promoters, may 
participate in the precise regulation of expression of tissue-specific genes 
important for both embryogenesis and organogenesis by recruiting Polycomb Group 
(PcG) complexes. PcG complexes usually poise the transcription of developmental 
genes by forming Polycomb bodies to compact poised enhancers and promoters 
marked by H3K27me3 in the 3D space. Additionally, recent studies have also 
uncovered their roles in transcriptional activation. To better understand the 
full complexities in the mechanisms of how PcG complexes regulate transcription 
and long-range 3D contacts of enhancers and promoters during developmental 
programs, we outline novel insights regarding PcG-associated dramatic changes in 
the 3D chromatin conformation in developmental programs of early embryos and 
naïve-ground-state transitions of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and 
highlight the distinct roles of unique and common subunits of canonical and 
non-canonical PcG complexes in shaping genome architectures and transcriptional 
programs."
1584,"Chronic lung diseases are highly prevalent worldwide and cause significant 
mortality. Lung cancer is the end stage of many chronic lung diseases. RNA 
epigenetics can dynamically modulate gene expression and decide cell fate. 
Recently, studies have confirmed that RNA epigenetics plays a crucial role in 
the developing of chronic lung diseases. Further exploration of the underlying 
mechanisms of RNA epigenetics in chronic lung diseases, including lung cancer, 
may lead to a better understanding of the diseases and promote the development 
of new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. This article reviews basic 
information on RNA modifications, including N6 methylation of adenosine (m6A), 
N1 methylation of adenosine (m1A), N7-methylguanosine (m7G), 5-methylcytosine 
(m5C), 2'O-methylation (2'-O-Me or Nm), pseudouridine (5-ribosyl uracil or Ψ), 
and adenosine to inosine RNA editing (A-to-I editing). We then show how they 
relate to different types of lung disease. This paper hopes to summarize the 
mechanisms of RNA modification in chronic lung disease and finds a new way to 
develop early diagnosis and treatment of chronic lung disease."
1585,"Delayed cancer detection is one of the common causes of poor prognosis in the 
case of many cancers, including cancers of the oral cavity. Despite the 
improvement and development of new and efficient gene therapy treatments, very 
little has been carried out to algorithmically assess the impedance of these 
carcinomas. In this work, from attributes or NCBI's oral cancer datasets, viz. 
(i) name, (ii) gene(s), (iii) protein change, (iv) condition(s), clinical 
significance (last reviewed). We sought to train the number of instances 
emerging from them. Further, we attempt to annotate viable attributes in oral 
cancer gene datasets for the identification of gingivobuccal cancer (GBC). We 
further apply supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to the gene 
datasets, revealing key candidate attributes for GBC prognosis. Our work 
highlights the importance of automated identification of key genes responsible 
for GBC that could perhaps be easily replicated in other forms of oral cancer 
detection."
1586,"Glyprolines are Gly-Pro (GP)- or Pro-Gly (PG)-containing biogenic peptides. 
These peptides can act as neutrophil chemoattractants, or atheroprotective, 
anticoagulant, and neuroprotective agents. The Pro-Gly-Pro (PGP) tripeptide is 
an active factor of resistance to the biodegradation of peptide drugs. The 
synthetic Semax peptide, which includes Met-Glu-His-Phe (MEHF) fragments of 
adrenocorticotropic hormone and the C-terminal tripeptide PGP, serves as a 
neuroprotective drug for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Previously, we 
revealed that Semax mostly prevented the disruption of the gene expression 
pattern 24 h after a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in a rat 
brain model. The genes of this pattern were grouped into an inflammatory cluster 
(IC) and a neurotransmitter cluster (NC). Here, using real-time RT-PCR, the 
effect of other PGP-containing peptides, PGP and Pro-Gly-Pro-Leu (PGPL), on the 
expression of a number of genes in the IC and NC was studied 24 h after tMCAO. 
Both the PGP and PGPL peptides showed Semax-unlike effects, predominantly 
without changing gene expression 24 h after tMCAO. Moreover, there were IC genes 
(iL1b, iL6, and Socs3) for PGP, as well as IC (iL6, Ccl3, Socs3, and Fos) and NC 
genes (Cplx2, Neurod6, and Ptk2b) for PGPL, that significantly changed in 
expression levels after peptide administration compared to Semax treatment under 
tMCAO conditions. Furthermore, gene enrichment analysis was carried out, and a 
regulatory gene network was constructed. Thus, the spectra of the common and 
unique effects of the PGP, PGPL, and Semax peptides under ischemia-reperfusion 
were distinguished."
1587,"The widespread use of whole exome sequencing (WES) resulted in the discovery of 
multilocus pathogenic variations (MPV), defined as two or more distinct or 
overlapping Mendelian disorders occurring in a patient, leading to a blended 
phenotype. In this study, we report on a child with autosomal recessive primary 
microcephaly-5 (MCPH5) and nephropathic cystinosis. The proband is the first 
child of consanguineous parents, presenting a complex phenotype including 
neurodevelopmental delay, microcephaly, growth restriction, significant delay of 
bone maturation, lissencephaly, and abnormality of neuronal migration, 
photophobia, and renal tubular acidosis. WES revealed two pathogenic and 
homozygous variants: a c.4174C&gt;T variant in the ASPM gene and a c.382C&gt;T 
variant in the CTNS gene, explaining the complex phenotype. The literature 
review showed that most of the patients harboring two variants in recessive 
disease genes are born to consanguineous parents. To the best of our knowledge, 
the patient herein described is the first one harboring pathogenic variants in 
both the ASPM and CTNS genes. These findings highlight the importance of 
searching for MPV in patients with complex phenotypes investigated by 
genome-wide testing methods, especially for those patients born to 
consanguineous parents."
1588,"The regulation of the fish phenotype and muscle growth is influenced by fasting 
and refeeding periods, which occur in nature and are commonly applied in fish 
farming. However, the regulators associated with the muscle responses to these 
manipulations of food availability have not been fully characterized. We aimed 
to identify novel genes associated with fish skeletal muscle adaptation during 
fasting and refeeding based on a meta-analysis. Genes related to translational 
and proliferative machinery were investigated in pacus (Piaractus mesopotamicus) 
subjected to fasting (four and fifteen days) and refeeding (six hours, three and 
fifteen days). Our results showed that different fasting and refeeding periods 
modulate the expression of the genes mtor, rps27a, eef1a2, and cdkn1a. These 
alterations can indicate the possible protection of the muscle phenotype, in 
addition to adaptive responses that prioritize energy and substrate savings over 
cell division, a process regulated by ccnd1. Our study reveals the potential of 
meta-analysis for the identification of muscle growth regulators and provides 
new information on muscle responses to fasting and refeeding in fish that are of 
economic importance to aquaculture."
1589,"Kinesin, as a member of the molecular motor protein superfamily, plays an 
essential function in various plants' developmental processes. Especially at the 
early stages of plant growth, including influences on plants' growth rate, 
yield, and quality. In this study, we did a genome-wide identification and 
expression profile analysis of the kinesin family in barley. Forty-two HvKINs 
were identified and screened from the barley genome, and a generated 
phylogenetic tree was used to compare the evolutionary relationships between 
Rice and Arabidopsis. The protein structure prediction, physicochemical 
properties, and bioinformatics of the HvKINs were also dissected. Our results 
reveal the important regulatory roles of HvKIN genes in barley growth. We found 
many cis- elements related to GA3 and ABA in homeopathic elements of the HvKIN 
gene and verified them by QRT-PCR, indicating their potential role in the barley 
kinesin family. The current study revealed the biological functions of barley 
kinesin genes in barley and will aid in further investigating the kinesin in 
other plant species."
1590,"Over the last decades, accumulating evidence has shown tumor-dependent profiles 
of miR-708, being either up- or downregulated, and thus, acting as a ""Janus"" 
regulator of oncogenic pathways. Herein, its functional duality was assessed 
through a thorough review of the literature and further validation in silico 
using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
databases. In the literature, miR-708 was found with an oncogenic role in eight 
tumor types, while a suppressor tumor role was described in seven cancers. This 
double profile was also found in TCGA and GEO databases, with some tumor types 
having a high expression of miR-708 and others with low expression compared with 
non-tumor counterparts. The investigation of validated targets using miRBase, 
miRTarBase, and miRecords platforms, identified a total of 572 genes that 
appeared enriched for PI3K-Akt signaling, followed by cell cycle control, p53, 
Apellin and Hippo signaling, endocrine resistance, focal adhesion, and cell 
senescence regulations, which are all recognized contributors of tumoral 
phenotypes. Among these targets, a set of 15 genes shared by at least two 
platforms was identified, most of which have important roles in cancer cells 
that influence either tumor suppression or progression. In a clinical scenario, 
miR-708 has shown to be a good diagnostic and prognosis marker. However, its 
multitarget nature and opposing roles in diverse human tumors, aligned with 
insufficient experimental data and the lack of proper delivery strategies, 
hamper its potential as a sequence-directed therapeutic."
1591,"Transposable elements (TEs) are abundant in genomes. Their mobilization can lead 
to genetic variability that is useful for evolution, but can also have 
deleterious biological effects. Somatic mobilization (SM) has been linked to 
degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer. We used a 
Drosophila simulans strain, in which SM can be measured by counting red spots in 
the eyes, to investigate how chemotherapeutic agents affect expression and SM of 
the mariner TE. Flies were treated with Cisplatin, Dacarbazine, and 
Daunorubicin. After acute exposure, relative expression of mariner was 
quantified by RT-qPCR and oxidative stress was measured by biochemical assays. 
Exposure to 50 and 100 µg/mL Cisplatin increased mariner expression and ROS 
levels; catalase activity increased at 100 µg/mL. With chronic exposure, the 
number of spots also increased, indicating higher mariner SM. Dacarbazine (50 
and 100 µg/mL) did not significantly alter mariner expression or mobilization or 
ROS levels, but decreased catalase activity (100 µg/mL). Daunorubicin (25 and 50 
µM) increased mariner expression, but decreased mariner SM. ROS and catalase 
activity were also reduced. Our data suggest that stress factors may 
differentially affect the expression and SM of TEs. The increase in mariner 
transposase gene expression is necessary, but not sufficient for mariner SM."
1592,"Genomic sequence data from worldwide human populations have provided a range of 
novel insights into our shared ancestry and the historical migrations that have 
shaped our global genetic diversity. However, a comprehensive understanding of 
these fundamental questions has been impeded by the lack of inclusion of many 
Indigenous populations in genomic surveys, including those from the Wallacean 
archipelago (which comprises islands of present-day Indonesia located east and 
west of Wallace's and Lydekker's Lines, respectively) and the former continent 
of Sahul (which once combined New Guinea and Australia during lower sea levels 
in the Pleistocene). Notably, these regions have been important areas of human 
evolution throughout the Late Pleistocene, as documented by diverse fossil and 
archaeological records which attest to the regional presence of multiple hominin 
species prior to the arrival of anatomically modern human (AMH) migrants. In 
this review, we collate and discuss key findings from the past decade of 
population genetic and phylogeographic literature focussed on the hominin 
history in Wallacea and Sahul. Specifically, we examine the evidence for the 
timing and direction of the ancient AMH migratory movements and subsequent 
hominin mixing events, emphasising several novel but consistent results that 
have important implications for addressing these questions. Finally, we suggest 
potentially lucrative directions for future genetic research in this key region 
of human evolution."
1593,"Gentiana macrophylla Pall. (G. macrophylla)-a member of the family 
Gentianaceae-is a well-known traditional Chinese medical herb. Iridoids are the 
main active components of G. macrophylla, which has a wide range of 
pharmacological activities such as dispelling wind, eliminating dampness, 
clearing heat and asthenic fever, hepatoprotective and choleretic actions, and 
other medicinal effects. In this study, a total of 67,048 unigenes were obtained 
by transcriptomic sequencing analysis of G. macrophylla. A BLAST analysis showed 
that 48.21%, 33.66%, 46.32%, and 32.62% of unigenes were identified in the NR, 
Swiss-Prot, eggNOG, and KEGG databases, respectively. Twenty-five key enzymes 
were identified in the iridoid biosynthesis pathway. Most of the upregulated 
unigenes were enriched in flowers and leaves. The trustworthiness of the 
transcriptomic data was validated by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). A 
total of 22 chemical constituents were identified by ultra-high performance 
liquid chromatography-quadrupole-electrostatic field Orbitrap mass spectrometry 
(UPLC-Q-Exactive MS), including 10 iridoids. A correlation analysis showed that 
the expression of 7-DLH and SLS was closely related to iridoids. The expression 
of 7-DLH and SLS was higher in flowers, indicating that flowers are important 
for iridoid biosynthesis in G. macrophylla."
1594,"Alfalfa represents one of the most important legume forages, and it is also 
applied as an organic fertilizer to improve soil quality. However, this 
perennial plant is native to warmer temperate regions, and its valuable 
cold-acclimation-related regulatory mechanisms are still less known. In higher 
plants, the bHLH transcription factors play pleiotropic regulatory roles in 
response to abiotic stresses. The recently released whole genome sequencing data 
of alfalfa allowed us to identify 469 MsbHLHs by multi-step homolog search. 
Herein, we primarily identified 65 MsbHLH genes that significantly upregulated 
under cold stress, and such bHLHs were classified into six clades according to 
their expression patterns. Interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis and 
conserved motif screening of the cold-induced MsbHLHs showed that the expression 
pattern is relatively varied in each bHLH subfamily, this result indicating that 
the 65 MsbHLHs may be involved in a complex cold-responsive regulatory network. 
Hence, we analyzed the TFBSs at promoter regions that unraveled a relatively 
conserved TFBS distribution with genes exhibiting similar expression patterns. 
Eventually, to verify the core components involved in long-term cold 
acclimation, we examined transcriptome data from a freezing-tolerant species 
(cv. Zhaodong) in the field and compared the expression of 
cold-sensitive/tolerant subspecies of alfalfa, giving 11 bHLH as candidates, 
which could be important for further cold-tolerance enhancement and molecular 
breeding through genetic engineering in alfalfa."
1595,"Alström syndrome (ALMS) and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) are rare genetic 
diseases with a number of common clinical features ranging from early-childhood 
obesity and retinal degeneration. ALMS and BBS belong to the ciliopathies, which 
are known to have the expression products of genes, encoding them as 
cilia-localized proteins in multiple target organs. The aim of this study was to 
perform transcriptomic and proteomic analysis on cellular models of ALMS and BBS 
syndromes to identify common and distinct pathological mechanisms present in 
both syndromes. For this purpose, epithelial cells were isolated from the urine 
of patients and healthy subjects, which were then cultured and reprogrammed into 
induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The pathways of genes associated with the 
metabolism of lipids and glycosaminoglycan and the transport of small molecules 
were found to be concomitantly downregulated in both diseases, while transcripts 
related to signal transduction, the immune system, cell cycle control and DNA 
replication and repair were upregulated. Furthermore, protein pathways 
associated with autophagy, apoptosis, cilium assembly and Gli1 protein were 
upregulated in both ciliopathies. These results provide new insights into the 
common and divergent pathogenic pathways between two similar genetic syndromes, 
particularly in relation to primary cilium function and abnormalities in cell 
differentiation."
1596,"BACKGROUND: Stemness markers play critical roles in the maintenance of key 
properties of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), including the pluripotency, stemness 
state, and self-renewal capacities, as well as cell fate decision. Some of these 
features are present in cancer stem cells (CSCs). TWIST1, as a bHLH 
transcription factor oncogene, is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) process in both embryonic and cancer development. Our aim in 
this study was to investigate the functional correlation between TWIST1 and the 
involved genes in the process of CSCs self-renewal in human esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma (ESCC) line KYSE-30.
METHODS: TWIST1 overexpression was enforced in the ESCC KYSE-30 cells using 
retroviral vector containing the specific pruf-IRES-GFP-hTWIST1 sequence. 
Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, the mRNA expression profile of 
TWIST1 and the stem cell markers, including BMI1, CRIPTO1, DPPA2, KLF4, SOX2, 
NANOG, and MSI1, were assessed using relative comparative real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Ectopic expression of TWIST1 in KYSE-30 cells resulted in an increased 
expression of TWIST1 compared to control GFP cells by nearly 9-fold. 
Transduction of TWIST1-retroviral particles caused a significant enhancement in 
BMI1, CRIPTO1, DPPA2, KLF4, and SOX2 mRNA expression, approximately 4.5-, 3.2-, 
5.5-, 3.5-, and 3.7-folds, respectively, whereas this increased TWIST1 
expression caused no change in the mRNA expression of NANOG and MSI1 genes.
CONCLUSIONS: TWIST1 gene ectopic expression in KYSE-30 cells enhanced the level 
of cancer stem cell markers' mRNA expression. These results may emphasize the 
role of TWIST1 in the self-renewal process and may corroborate the involvement 
of TWIST1 in the stemness state capacity of ESCC cell line KYSE-30, as well as 
its potential as a therapeutic target."
1597,"Already used for the treatment of some allergic and inflammatory diseases, such 
as asthma or atopic dermatitis, dupilumab has also been approved as add-on 
therapy for patients with CRSwNP, and it could represent the keystone to 
reducing the remission time as well as to improve healing and quality of life. 
On the other hand, the role of miRNAs as potential biomarkers of immune 
modulation is emerging. We analyzed the effects of a short-time treatment with 
dupilumab in patients with CRSwNP, analyzing the immune response modification as 
well as miRNAs modulations. First, in this early observation stage, all patients 
experienced remarkable improvement and were clinically stable. Indeed, we 
observed a significant decrease in CD4+ T cells and a significant reduction in 
total IgE (p &lt; 0.05) and serum IL-8 levels (p &lt; 0.01), indicating a 
reduction in the general inflammatory condition. In addition, we analyzed a 
panel of about 200 circulating miRNAs. After treatment, we noted a significant 
downregulation of hsa-mir-25-3p (p-value = 0.02415) and hsa-mir-185-5p (p-value 
= 0.04547), two miRNAs involved in the proliferation, inflammation, and 
dug-resistance, in accordance with the clinical status of patients. All these 
preliminary data aimed to identify new biomarkers of prognosis, identifiable 
with non-invasive procedures for patients. Further, these patients are still 
under observation, and others with different levels of responsiveness to 
treatment need to be enrolled to increase the statistical data."
1598,"This study aimed to establish the importance of ergothioneine (ERT) in the 
erythroid adaptation mechanisms by appraising the expression levels of 
redox-related genes associated with the PI3K/AKT/FoxO3 and Nrf2-ARE pathways 
using K562 cells induced to erythroid differentiation and H2O2-oxidative stress. 
Cell viability and gene expression were evaluated. Two concentrations of ERT 
were assessed, 1 nM (C1) and 100 µM (C2), with and without stress induction (100 
µM H2O2). Assessments were made in three periods of the cellular differentiation 
process (D0, D2, and D4). The C1 treatment promoted the induction of FOXO3 (D0 
and 2), PSMB5, and 6 expressions (D4); C1 + H2O2 treatment showed the highest 
levels of NRF2 transcripts, KEAP1 (D0), YWHAQ (D2 and 4), PSMB5 (D2) and PSMB6 
(D4); and C2 + H2O2 (D2) an increase in FOXO3 and MST1 expression, with a 
decrease of YWHAQ and NRF2 was observed. in C2 + H2O2 (D2) an increase in FOXO3 
and MST1, with a decrease in YWHAQ and NRF2 was observed All ERT treatments 
increased gamma-globin expression. Statistical multivariate analyzes highlighted 
that the Nrf2-ARE pathway presented a greater contribution in the production of 
PRDX1, SOD1, CAT, and PSBM5 mRNAs, whereas the PI3K/AKT/FoxO3 pathway was 
associated with the PRDX2 and TRX transcripts. In conclusion, ERT presented a 
cytoprotective action through Nrf2 and FoxO3, with the latter seeming to 
contribute to erythroid proliferation/differentiation."
1599,"The ADNP-gene-related neurodevelopmental disorder Helsmoortel-Van der Aa 
syndrome is a rare syndromic-intellectual disability-an autism spectrum disorder 
first described by Helsmoortel and Van der Aa in 2014. Recently, a large cohort 
including 78 patients and their detailed phenotypes were presented by Van Dijck 
et al., 2019, who reported developmental delay, speech delay and autism spectrum 
disorder as nearly constant findings with or without variable cardiological, 
gastroenterological, urogenital, endocrine and neurological manifestations. 
Among cardiac malformations, atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, 
patent foramen ovale and mitral valve prolapse were the most common findings, 
but other unspecified defects, such as mild pulmonary valve stenosis, were also 
described. We present two patients with pathogenic ADNP variants and unusual 
cardiothoracic manifestations-Bland-White-Garland syndrome, pectus carinatum 
superiorly along the costochondral junctions and pectus excavatum inferiorly in 
one patient, and Kawasaki syndrome with pericardiac effusion, coronary artery 
dilatation and aneurysm in the other-who were successfully treated with 
intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroid and aspirin. Both patients had 
ectodermal and/or skeletal features overlapping those seen in RASopathies, 
supporting the observations of Alkhunaizi et al. 2018. on the clinical overlap 
between Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome and Noonan syndrome. We observed a 
morphological overlap with the Noonan-like disorder with anagen hair in our 
patients."
1600,"Currently, there are still many challenges in prenatal diagnosis, such as 
limited or uncertain fetal phenotyping, variant interpretation, and rapid 
turnaround times. The aim of this study was to illustrate the value of a 
comprehensive genomic evaluation in prenatal diagnosis. We retrospectively 
reviewed 20 fetuses with clinically significant copy number variants (CNVs) 
detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and no further exome 
sequencing testing in our tertiary center between 2019 and 2020. The residual 
DNA from the prenatal cases was used for the parallel implementation of CNV 
sequencing (CNV-seq) and trio-based clinical exome sequencing (trio-CES). CMA 
revealed 26 clinically significant CNVs (18 deletions and eight duplications) in 
20 fetuses, in which five fetuses had two or more CNVs. There were eight fetuses 
with pathogenic CNVs (e.g., del 1p36), nine fetuses with likely pathogenic CNVs 
(e.g., dup 22q11.21), and three fetuses with variants of unknown significance 
(VOUS, e.g., dup 1q21.1q21.2). Trio-CES identified four fetuses with likely 
pathogenic mutations (SNV/InDels). Of note, a fetus was detected with a 
maternally inherited hemizygous variant in the SLX4 gene due to a 16p13.3 
deletion on the paternal chromosome. The sizes of CNVs detected by CNV-seq were 
slightly larger than that of the SNP array, and four cases with mosaic CNVs were 
all identified by CNV-seq. In conclusion, microdeletion/duplication syndromes 
and monogenic disorders may co-exist in a subject, and CNV deletion may 
contribute to uncovering additional recessive disease alleles. The application 
of a comprehensive genomic evaluation (CNVs and SNV/InDels) has great value in 
the prenatal diagnosis arena. CNV-seq based on NGS technology is a reliable and 
a cost-effective technique for identifying CNVs."
1601,"Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM) is an autosomal recessive neuro-ophthalmologic 
syndrome characterized by microcephaly, microphthalmia, congenital cataracts, 
cortical dysplasia, corpus callosum hypoplasia, spasticity, and hypogonadism. 
WARBM is divided into four subtypes according to the causative genes, of which 
RAB3GAP1 (OMIM# 602536) accounts for the highest proportion. We collected 
detailed medical records and performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) for a 
congenital cataract patient. A novel heterozygous frameshift RAB3GAP1 variant 
was detected in a boy with a rare ocular phenotype of bilateral membranous 
cataracts accompanied by a persistent papillary membrane. Further copy number 
variation (CNV) analysis identified a novel deletion on chromosome 2q21.3 that 
removed 4 of the 24 exons of RAB3GAP1. The patient was diagnosed with WARBM 
following genetic testing. The present study expands the genotypic and 
phenotypic spectrum of WARBM. It suggests applying whole exome sequencing (WES) 
and CNV analysis for the early diagnosis of syndromic diseases in children with 
congenital cataracts."
1602,"Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) offer an exciting resource for probing human 
biology; however, gene-editing efficiency remains relatively low in many cell 
types, including stem cells. Gene-editing using the CRISPR-Cas9 system offers an 
attractive solution that improves upon previous gene-editing approaches; 
however, like other technologies, off-target mutagenesis remains a concern. 
High-fidelity Cas9 variants greatly reduce off-target mutagenesis and offer a 
solution to this problem. To evaluate their utility as part of a cell-based 
gene-editing platform, human PSC lines were generated with a high-fidelity (HF) 
tetracycline-inducible engineered Streptococcus pyogenes SpCas9 (HF-iCas9) 
integrated into the AAVS1 safe harbor locus. By engineering cells with 
controllable expression of Cas9, we eliminated the need to include a large 
Cas9-expressing plasmid during cell transfection. Delivery of genetic cargo was 
further optimized by packaging DNA targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) and donor 
fragments into a single plasmid backbone. The potential of homology-directed 
repair (HDR) based gene knock-in at the CLYBL safe harbor site and endogenous 
SOX2 and SIX6 genes were demonstrated. Moreover, we used non-homologous 
end-joining (NHEJ) for gene knockout of disease-relevant alleles. These 
high-fidelity CRISPR tools and the resulting HF-iCas9 cell lines will facilitate 
the production of cell-type reporters and mutants across different genetic 
backgrounds."
1603,"The ever-growing number of methods for the generation of synthetic bulk and 
single cell RNA-seq data have multiple and diverse applications. They are often 
aimed at benchmarking bioinformatics algorithms for purposes such as sample 
classification, differential expression analysis, correlation and network 
studies and the optimization of data integration and normalization techniques. 
Here, we propose a general framework to compare synthetically generated RNA-seq 
data and select a data-generating tool that is suitable for a set of specific 
study goals. As there are multiple methods for synthetic RNA-seq data 
generation, researchers can use the proposed framework to make an informed 
choice of an RNA-seq data simulation algorithm and software that are best suited 
for their specific scientific questions of interest."
1604,"Our aim was to analyze the phenotypic-genetic correlations in a patient 
diagnosed with early onset corticobasal syndrome with progressive non-fluent 
aphasia (CBS-PNFA), characterized by predominant apraxia of speech, accompanied 
by prominent right-sided upper-limb limb-kinetic apraxia, alien limb phenomenon, 
synkinesis, myoclonus, mild cortical sensory loss, and right-sided hemispatial 
neglect. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified rare single heterozygous 
variants in ATP7B (c.3207C&gt;A), SORL1 (c.352G&gt;A), SETX (c.2385_2387delAAA), 
and FOXP1 (c.1762G&gt;A) genes. The functional analysis revealed that the 
deletion in the SETX gene changed the splicing pattern, which was accompanied by 
lower SETX mRNA levels in the patient's fibroblasts, suggesting loss-of-function 
as the underlying mechanism. In addition, the patient's fibroblasts demonstrated 
altered mitochondrial architecture with decreased connectivity, compared to the 
control individuals. This is the first association of the CBS-PNFA phenotype 
with the most common ATP7B pathogenic variant p.H1069Q, previously linked to 
Wilson's disease, and early onset Parkinson's disease. This study expands the 
complex clinical spectrum related to variants in well-known disease genes, such 
as ATP7B, SORL1, SETX, and FOXP1, corroborating the hypothesis of oligogenic 
inheritance. To date, the FOXP1 gene has been linked exclusively to 
neurodevelopmental speech disorders, while our study highlights its possible 
relevance for adult-onset progressive apraxia of speech, which guarantees 
further study."
1605,"Bothnian palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKB, MIM600231) is an autosomal dominant 
form of diffuse non-epidermolytic PPK characterized by spontaneous 
yellowish-white PPK associated with a spongy appearance after water-immersion. 
It is due to AQP5 heterozygous mutations. We report four patients carrying a 
novel AQP5 heterozygous mutation (c.125T&gt;A; p.(Ile42Asn)), and belonging to 
the same French family. Early palmoplantar swelling (before one year of age), 
pruritus and hyperhidrosis were constant. The PPK was finally characterized as 
transgrediens, non-progrediens, diffuse PPK with a clear delineation between 
normal and affected skin. The cutaneous modifications at water-immersion test, 
""hand-in-the-bucket sign"", were significantly evident after 3 to 6 min of 
immersion in the children and father, respectively. AQP5 protein is expressed in 
eccrine sweat glands (ESG), salivary and airway submucosal glands. In PPKB, gain 
of function mutations seem to widen the channel diameter of ESG and increase 
water movement. Thus, swelling seems to be induced by hypotonicity with water 
entrance into cells, while hyperhidrosis is the result of an increased cytosolic 
calcium concentration."
1606,"Joint laxity is a multifactorial phenotype with a heritable component. Mutations 
or common polymorphisms within the α1(V) (COL5A1), α1(XI) (COL11A1) and α2(XI) 
(COL11A2) collagen genes have been reported or proposed to associate with joint 
hypermobility, range of motion and/or genu recurvatum. The aim of this study was 
to investigate whether polymorphisms within these collagen-encoding genes are 
associated with measurements of knee joint laxity and computed ligament length 
changes within the non-dominant leg. One hundred and six healthy participants 
were assessed for genu recurvatum (knee hyperextension), anterior-posterior 
tibial translation, external-internal tibial rotation and ligament length 
changes during knee rotation of their non-dominant leg. Participants were 
genotyped for COL5A1 rs12722 (T/C), COL11A1 rs3753841 (C/T), COL11A1 rs1676486 
(T/C) and COL11A2 rs1799907 (A/T). The genotype-genotype combination of any two 
or more of the four COL5A1 rs12722 CC, COL11A1 rs3753841 CC, COL11A1 rs1676486 
TT and COL11A2 rs1799907 AA genotypes was associated with decreased active and 
passive knee hyperextension. These genotype-genotype combinations, including sex 
(male), increased age and decreased body mass collectively, also contributed to 
decreased passive knee hyperextension. These findings suggest that COL5A1, 
COL11A1 and COL11A2 gene-gene interactions are associated with knee 
hyperextension measurements of the non-dominant leg of healthy individuals."
1607,"In 2018, a new clinical subtype, caused by biallelic variants in the AEBP1 gene, 
encoding the ACLP protein, was added to the current nosological classification 
of the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS). This new phenotype, provisionally termed 
EDS classical-like type 2 (clEDS2), has not yet been fully characterized, as 
only nine cases have been reported to date. Here we describe a patient, 
homozygous for a novel AEBP1 pathogenic variant (NM_001129.5 c.2123_2124delTG 
(p.Val708AlafsTer5)), whose phenotype is reminiscent of classical EDS but also 
includes previously unreported multiple congenital malformations. Furthermore, 
we briefly summarize the current principal clinical manifestations of clEDS2 and 
the molecular evidence surrounding the role of AEBP1 in the context of 
extracellular matrix homeostasis and connective tissue development. Although a 
different coexisting etiology for the multiple congenital malformations of our 
patient cannot be formally excluded, the emerging role of ACLP in TGF-β and WNT 
pathways may explain their occurrence and the phenotypical variability of 
clEDS2."
1608,"Diseases caused by necrotrophic fungi, such as the cosmopolitan Sclerotinia 
sclerotiorum and the Diaporthe/Phomopsis complex, are among the most destructive 
diseases of sunflower worldwide. The lack of complete resistance combined with 
the inefficiency of chemical control makes assisted breeding the best strategy 
for disease control. In this work, we present an integrated genome-wide 
association (GWA) study investigating the response of a diverse panel of 
sunflower inbred lines to both pathogens. Phenotypic data for Sclerotinia head 
rot (SHR) consisted of five disease descriptors (disease incidence, DI; disease 
severity, DS; area under the disease progress curve for DI, AUDPCI, and DS, 
AUDPCS; and incubation period, IP). Two disease descriptors (DI and DS) were 
evaluated for two manifestations of Diaporthe/Phomopsis: Phomopsis stem canker 
(PSC) and Phomopsis head rot (PHR). In addition, a principal component (PC) 
analysis was used to derive transformed phenotypes as inputs to a univariate GWA 
(PC-GWA). Genotypic data comprised a panel of 4269 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNP), generated via genotyping-by-sequencing. The GWA analysis 
revealed 24 unique marker-trait associations for SHR, 19 unique marker-trait 
associations for Diaporthe/Phomopsis diseases, and 7 markers associated with PC1 
and PC2. No common markers were found for the response to the two pathogens. 
Nevertheless, epistatic interactions were identified between markers 
significantly associated with the response to S. sclerotiorum and 
Diaporthe/Phomopsis. This suggests that, while the main determinants of 
resistance may differ for the two pathogens, there could be an underlying common 
genetic basis. The exploration of regions physically close to the associated 
markers yielded 364 genes, of which 19 were predicted as putative disease 
resistance genes. This work presents the first simultaneous evaluation of two 
manifestations of Diaporthe/Phomopsis in sunflower, and undertakes a 
comprehensive GWA study by integrating PSC, PHR, and SHR data. The multiple 
regions identified, and their exploration to identify candidate genes, 
contribute not only to the understanding of the genetic basis of resistance, but 
also to the development of tools for assisted breeding."
1609,"BACKGROUND: Heterozygous gain-of-function variants in SAMD9L are associated with 
ataxia-pancytopenia syndrome (ATXPC) and monosomy 7 myelodysplasia and leukemia 
syndrome-1 (M7MLS1). Association with peripheral neuropathy has rarely been 
described.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) from DNA extracted from peripheral blood 
was performed in a 10-year-old female presenting with demyelinating neuropathy, 
her similarly affected mother and the unaffected maternal grandparents. In 
addition to evaluation of single nucleotide variants, thorough work-up of copy 
number and exome-wide variant allele frequency data was performed.
RESULTS: Combined analysis of the mother's and daughter's duo-exome data and 
analysis of the mother's and her parents' trio-exome data initially failed to 
detect a disease-associated variant. More detailed analysis revealed a copy 
number neutral loss of heterozygosity of 7q in the mother and led to reanalysis 
of the exome data for respective sequence variants. Here, a previously reported 
likely pathogenic variant in the SAMD9L gene on chromosome 7q 
(NM_152703.5:c.2956C&gt;T; p.(Arg986Cys)) was identified that was not detected 
with standard filter settings because of a low percentage in blood cells (13%). 
The variant also showed up in the daughter at 32%, a proportion well below the 
expected 50%, which in each case can be explained by clonal selection processes 
in the blood due to this SAMD9L variant.
CONCLUSION: The report highlights the specific pitfalls of molecular genetic 
analysis of SAMD9L and, furthermore, shows that gain-of-function variants in 
this gene can lead to a clinical picture associated with the leading symptom of 
peripheral neuropathy. Due to clonal hematopoietic selection, displacement of 
the mutant allele occurred, making diagnosis difficult."
1610,"The novel coronavirus-19 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected numerous individuals 
worldwide, resulting in millions of fatalities. The pandemic spread with high 
mortality rates in multiple waves, leaving others with moderate to severe 
symptoms. Co-morbidity variables, including hypertension, diabetes, and 
immunosuppression, have exacerbated the severity of COVID-19. In addition, 
numerous efforts have been made to comprehend the pathogenic and host variables 
that contribute to COVID-19 susceptibility and pathogenesis. One of these 
endeavours is understanding the host genetic factors predisposing an individual 
to COVID-19. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have demonstrated the host 
predisposition factors in different populations. These factors are involved in 
the appropriate immune response, their imbalance influences susceptibility or 
resistance to viral infection. This review investigated the host genetic 
components implicated at the various stages of viral pathogenesis, including 
viral entry, pathophysiological alterations, and immunological responses. In 
addition, the recent and most updated genetic variations associated with 
multiple host factors affecting COVID-19 pathogenesis are described in the 
study."
1611,"Disproportionate dwarfism phenotypes represent a heterogeneous subset of 
skeletal dysplasias and have been described in many species including humans and 
dogs. In this study, we investigated Vizsla dogs that were affected by 
disproportionate dwarfism that we propose to designate as skeletal dysplasia 3 
(SD3). The most striking skeletal changes comprised a marked shortening and 
deformation of the humerus and femur. An extended pedigree with six affected 
dogs suggested autosomal recessive inheritance. Combined linkage and 
homozygosity mapping localized a potential genetic defect to a ~4 Mb interval on 
chromosome 33. We sequenced the genome of an affected dog, and comparison with 
926 control genomes revealed a single, private protein-changing variant in the 
critical interval, PCYT1A:XM_038583131.1:c.673T&gt;C, predicted to cause an 
exchange of a highly conserved amino acid, XP_038439059.1:p.(Y225H). We observed 
perfect co-segregation of the genotypes with the phenotype in the studied 
family. When genotyping additional Vizslas, we encountered a single dog with 
disproportionate dwarfism that did not carry the mutant PCYT1A allele, which we 
hypothesize was due to heterogeneity. In the remaining 130 dogs, we observed 
perfect genotype-phenotype association, and none of the unaffected dogs were 
homozygous for the mutant PCYT1A allele. PCYT1A loss-of-function variants cause 
spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with cone-rod dystrophy (SMD-CRD) in humans. The 
skeletal changes in Vizslas were comparable to human patients. So far, no ocular 
phenotype has been recognized in dwarf Vizslas. We propose the PCYT1A missense 
variant as a candidate causative variant for SD3. Our data facilitate genetic 
testing of Vizslas to prevent the unintentional breeding of further affected 
puppies."
1612,"Cytochrome P450 is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of phase 1 xenobiotics, 
toxins, endogenous hormones, and drugs, including those used in COVID-19 
treatment. Cytochrome p450 genes are linked to the pathogenesis of some 
multifactorial traits and diseases, such as cancer, particularly prostate 
cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer. Genotyping was 
performed on 540 supposedly healthy individuals of 5 Finno-Permic populations 
from the territories of the European part of the Russian Federation. There was a 
statistically significant difference between Veps and most of the studied 
populations in the rs4986774 locus of the CYP2D6 gene; data on the rs3892097 
locus of the CYP2D6 gene shows that Izhemsky Komis are different from the 
Mordovian and Udmurt populations."
1613,"Euonymus microcarpus (Oliv.) Sprague, is a species of evergreen shrub of the 
genus Euonymus, family Celastraceae. Here, we extracted the genomic DNA from the 
leaves of E. microcarpus and constructed a paired-end library. The chloroplast 
genome of E. microcarpus was generated with the high-throughput sequencing by 
the illumina Hiseq X Ten platform and de novo assembly. The chloroplast genome 
had a quadripartite structure, containing a long single copy region with a size 
of 85,386 bp and a short single copy region with a size of 18,456 bp, separated 
by two inverted repeat regions of 26,850 bp. The chloroplast genome contained 
133 genes identified in total, including 87 potential protein-coding genes, 38 
transfer RNA genes, and eight ribosomal RNA genes. A total of 282 simple 
sequence repeats and 63 long repeats were found. Furthermore, the phylogenetic 
relationships inferred that E. microcarpus is sister to E. japonicus and E. 
schensianus. A comparison of the structure of the chloroplast genomes of eight 
Euonymus species suggests a nucleotide variability of the junction sites and a 
higher divergence of non-coding regions, compared to the coding regions. The 
original findings of the study serves as a good reference for chloroplast genome 
assembly and a valuable foundation for the genetic diversity and evolution of E. 
microcarpus."
1614,"Many Camellia oleifera germplasm resources were collected from Guizhou Province, 
but the fruit morphological variation and genetic diversity of C. oleifera 
germplasm resources remain unclear. The genetic diversity of C. oleifera 
germplasms resources in Guizhou was studied based on fruit traits and simple 
sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers to build a core collection. This paper 
aims to provide a scientific basis for the collection, management, development, 
and utilization of C. oleifera resources in Guizhou province. The variation 
coefficients among and within varieties of seven fruit phenotypic traits of C. 
oleifera ranged from 11.79% to 61.76% and from 8.15% to 42.31%, respectively, 
showing rich phenotypic variation. Furthermore, 12 SSR markers were used to 
analyze the genetic diversity. These primers generated 214 polymorphic bands, 
and the average number was 17.833. The average number of effective alleles (Ne), 
Shannon's information index (I), observed heterozygosity (Ho), expected 
heterozygosity (He), polymorphic information content (PIC), and major allele 
frequency (MAF) were 8.999, 2.301, 0.965, 0.50, 0.836, and 0.238, respectively. 
The results showed that 12 SSR markers had high polymorphism, and the genetic 
diversity of 167 C. oleifera germplasm resources was high. Based on SSR 
molecular marker information and fruit traits clustering, 167 C. oleifera 
germplasm resources were divided into three groups. When constructing core 
collections based on fruit traits and molecular marker information, the 
PowerCore-25 of core collections greatly preserves fruit traits and improves 
genetic diversity. This paper can provide a reference for the genetic diversity 
and fruit traits variation of C. camellia germplasm resources in Guizhou 
Province. It is significant for establishing a core collection, thus promoting 
germplasm innovation and the development of the oil tea industry in Guizhou."
1615,"Seed size is an important yield and quality-determining trait in higher plants 
and is also crucial to their evolutionary fitness. In African yam bean (AYB), 
seed size varies widely among different accessions. However, the genetic basis 
of such variation has not been adequately documented. A genome-wide marker-trait 
association study was conducted to identify genomic regions associated with four 
seed size traits (seed length, seed width, seed thickness, and 100-seed weight) 
in a panel of 195 AYB accessions. A total of 5416 SNP markers were generated 
from the diversity array technology sequence (DArTseq) genotype-by-sequencing 
(GBS)- approach, in which 2491 SNPs were retained after SNP quality control and 
used for marker-trait association analysis. Significant phenotypic variation was 
observed for the traits. Broad-sense heritability ranged from 50.0% (seed width) 
to 66.4% (seed length). The relationships among the traits were positive and 
significant. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the general linear model 
(GLM) and the mixed linear model (MLM) approaches identified 12 SNP markers 
significantly associated with seed size traits across the six test environments. 
The 12 makers explained 6.5-10.8% of the phenotypic variation. Two markers 
(29420334|F|0-52:C&gt;G-52:C&gt;G and 29420736|F|0-57:G&gt;T-57:G&gt;T) with 
pleiotropic effects associated with seed width and seed thickness were found. A 
candidate gene search identified five significant markers 
(100026424|F|0-37:C&gt;T-37:C&gt;T, 100041049|F|0-42:G&gt;C-42:G&gt;C, 
100034480|F|0-31:C&gt;A-31:C&gt;A, 29420365|F|0-55:C&gt;G-55:C&gt;G, and 
29420736|F|0-57:G&gt;T-57:G&gt;T) located close to 43 putative genes whose 
encoding protein products are known to regulate seed size traits. This study 
revealed significant makers not previously reported for seed size in AYB and 
could provide useful information for genomic-assisted breeding in AYB."
1616,"Neolamarckia cadamba (N. cadamba) is a fast-growing tree species with tremendous 
economic and ecological value; the study of the key genes regulating 
photosynthesis and sugar accumulation is very important for the breeding of N. 
cadamba. Fructose 1,6-bisphosptase (FBP) gene has been found to play a key role 
in plant photosynthesis, sugar accumulation and other growth processes. However, 
no systemic analysis of FBPs has been reported in N. cadamba. A total of six FBP 
genes were identifed and cloned based on the N. cadamba genome, and these FBP 
genes were sorted into four groups. The characteristics of the NcFBP gene family 
were analyzed such as phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, conserved 
motifs, and expression patterns. A cis-acting element related to circadian 
control was first found in the promoter region of FBP gene. Phylogenetic and 
quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that NcFBP5 and NcFBP6 may be 
chloroplast type 1 FBP and cytoplasmic FBP, respectively. FBP proteins from N. 
cadamba and 22 other plant species were used for phylogenetic analyses, 
indicating that FBP family may have expanded during the evolution of algae to 
mosses and differentiated cpFBPase1 proteins in mosses. This work analyzes the 
internal relationship between the evolution and expression of the six NcFBPs, 
providing a scientific basis for the evolutionary pattern of plant FBPs, and 
promoting the functional studies of FBP genes."
1617,"X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) is a primary immunodeficiency 
that is caused by mutations in the interleukin-2 receptor gamma (IL2RG) gene. 
Some patients present atypical X-SCID with mild clinical symptoms due to somatic 
revertant mosaicism. CRISPR/Cas9 and prime editing are two advanced genome 
editing tools that paved the way for treating immune deficiency diseases. Prime 
editing overcomes the limitations of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, as it does not need 
to induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) or exogenous donor DNA templates to modify 
the genome. Here, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 with single-stranded 
oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) and prime editing methods to generate an in vitro 
model of the disease in K-562 cells and healthy donors' T cells for the c. 
458T&gt;C point mutation in the IL2RG gene, which also resulted in a useful way 
to optimize the gene correction approach for subsequent experiments in patients' 
cells. Both methods proved to be successful and were able to induce the mutation 
of up to 31% of treated K-562 cells and 26% of treated T cells. We also applied 
similar strategies to correct the IL2RG c. 458T&gt;C mutation in patient T cells 
that carry the mutation with revertant somatic mosaicism. However, both methods 
failed to increase the frequency of the wild-type sequence in the mosaic T cells 
of patients due to limited in vitro proliferation of mutant cells and the 
presence of somatic reversion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
attempt to treat mosaic cells from atypical X-SCID patients employing 
CRISPR/Cas9 and prime editing. We showed that prime editing can be applied to 
the formation of specific-point IL2RG mutations without inducing nonspecific 
on-target modifications. We hypothesize that the feasibility of the nucleotide 
substitution of the IL2RG gene using gene therapy, especially prime editing, 
could provide an alternative strategy to treat X-SCID patients without revertant 
mutations, and further technological improvements need to be developed to 
correct somatic mosaicism mutations."
1618,"A lack of vitamin D is a potential risk factor for coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19). Variants in the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene, such as BglI rs739837 
and TaqI rs731236, are associated with various viral infection progressions. 
This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the BglI rs739837 and TaqI 
rs731236 polymorphisms and the mortality rate of COVID-19 based on severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. The genotyping of BglI 
rs739837 and TaqI rs731236 genotypes was analyzed using the polymerase chain 
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 1734 improved and 1450 
deceased patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, the rate of COVID-19 
mortality was correlated with TaqI rs731236 TC and CC in the α variant and with 
TaqI rs731236 CC in the Delta variant, whereas no relationship was found in the 
Omicron BA.5 variant. In addition, the rate of COVID-19 mortality was associated 
with BglI rs739837 GT and TT in the Omicron BA.5 variant, while there was no 
association between BglI rs739837 and COVID-19 mortality in the α and Delta 
variants. The TG haplotype was more common in all SARS-CoV-2 variants, while the 
CT haplotype was associated with COVID-19 mortality in the Delta and Omicron 
BA.5 variants. In conclusion, this study indicated that the impacts of BglI 
rs739837 and TaqI rs731236 polymorphisms were related to SARS-CoV-2 variants. 
However, further research is still needed to approve our findings."
1619,"To explain the sources of additional cell masses in the evolution of 
multicellular organisms, the theory of carcino-evo-devo, or evolution by tumor 
neofunctionalization, has been developed. The important demand for a new theory 
in experimental science is the capability to formulate non-trivial predictions 
which can be experimentally confirmed. Several non-trivial predictions were 
formulated using carcino-evo-devo theory, four of which are discussed in the 
present paper: (1) The number of cellular oncogenes should correspond to the 
number of cell types in the organism. The evolution of oncogenes, tumor 
suppressor and differentiation gene classes should proceed concurrently. (2) 
Evolutionarily new and evolving genes should be specifically expressed in tumors 
(TSEEN genes). (3) Human orthologs of fish TSEEN genes should acquire 
progressive functions connected with new cell types, tissues and organs. (4) 
Selection of tumors for new functions in the organism is possible. 
Evolutionarily novel organs should recapitulate tumor features in their 
development. As shown in this paper, these predictions have been confirmed by 
the laboratory of the author. Thus, we have shown that carcino-evo-devo theory 
has predictive power, fulfilling a fundamental requirement for a new theory."
1620,"The middle to lower reaches of the Yangtze River are China's second largest area 
for wheat production; wheat disease is more serious there than in other areas 
because of the high humidity and warm weather. However, most cultivated 
varieties are susceptible to Fusarium head blight (FHB), powdery mildew, and 
stripe rust, and the lack of disease-resistant germplasm is an obstacle in wheat 
breeding. Rye and Thinopyrum elongatum, related species of wheat, carry many 
genes involved in disease resistance. In this study, a trigeneric hybrid, YZU21, 
with resistance to FHB, powdery mildew, and stripe rust was used to improve two 
major wheat cultivars, Ningmai 13 (NM13) and Yangmai 23 (YM23). Specific 
molecular markers and GISH were used to identify hybrid progenies. Five addition 
or substitution lines and one translocation line of the 
Triticum-Secale-Thinopyrum trigeneric hybrid were obtained and evaluated for 
agronomic traits and the resistance to multiple diseases. The results showed 
that the six trigeneric hybrid lines had desirable agronomic traits and improved 
resistance to FHB, powdery mildew, and stripe rust; they might be used as 
parents in wheat breeding for the resistance to multiple disease."
1621,"In the studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD), jointly analyzing imaging data and 
genetic data provides an effective method to explore the potential biomarkers of 
AD. AD can be separated into healthy controls (HC), early mild cognitive 
impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and AD. In the 
meantime, identifying the important biomarkers of AD progression, and analyzing 
these biomarkers in AD provide valuable insights into understanding the 
mechanism of AD. In this paper, we present a novel data fusion method and a 
genetic weighted random forest method to mine important features. Specifically, 
we amplify the difference among AD, LMCI, EMCI and HC by introducing eigenvalues 
calculated from the gene p-value matrix for feature fusion. Furthermore, we 
construct the genetic weighted random forest using the resulting fused features. 
Genetic evolution is used to increase the diversity among decision trees and the 
decision trees generated are weighted by weights. After training, the genetic 
weighted random forest is analyzed further to detect the significant fused 
features. The validation experiments highlight the performance and 
generalization of our proposed model. We analyze the biological significance of 
the results and identify some significant genes (CSMD1, CDH13, PTPRD, MACROD2 
and WWOX). Furthermore, the calcium signaling pathway, arrhythmogenic right 
ventricular cardiomyopathy and the glutamatergic synapse pathway were 
identified. The investigational findings demonstrate that our proposed model 
presents an accurate and efficient approach to identifying significant 
biomarkers in AD."
1622,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a fatal disease, accounting for 75-85% of 
primary liver cancers. The conclusive research on miR-181c-5p's role in 
hepatocarcinogenesis, whether it has oncogenic effects or acts as a tumor 
repressor, is limited and fluctuating. Therefore, the current study aimed to 
elucidate the role of miR-181c-5p in HCC in silico and in vivo. The 
bioinformatics analysis of miR-181c-5p expression data in HCC using several 
databases strongly shed light on its involvement in HCC development, but also 
confirmed the fluctuating data around its role. miR-181c-5p was proven here to 
have an oncogenic role by increasing HepG2 cells' viability as confirmed by MTT 
analysis. In addition, miR-181c-5p was upregulated in the HCC positive control 
group and progressed the HCC development and malignant features by its forced 
expression in an HCC mouse model by targeted delivery using a LA-PAMAM polyplex. 
This is indicated by the cancerous gross and histological features, and the 
significant increase in liver function biomarkers. The functional enrichment 
bioinformatics analyses of miR-181c-5p-downregulated targets in HCC indicated 
that miR-181c-5p targets were significantly enriched in multiple pathways and 
biological processes involved in HCC development. Fbxl3, an example for 
miR-181c-5p potential targets, downregulation and its correlation with 
miR-181c-5p were validated by qPCR. In conclusion, miR-181c-5p is upregulated in 
HCC and has an oncogenic role enhancing HCC progression."
1623,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative 
bacteria involved in the pathogenic processes leading to mastitis and metritis 
in animals such as dairy cattle. LPS causes cell proliferation associated with 
endometrium inflammation. Former in vitro studies have demonstrated that LPS 
induces an intense stimulation of the proliferation of a pure population of 
bovine endometrial epithelial cells. In a follow-up transcriptomic study based 
on RNA-sequencing data obtained after 24 h exposure of primary bovine 
endometrial epithelial cells to 0, 2, and 8 μg/mL LPS, 752 and 727 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected between the controls and 
LPS-treated samples that encode proteins known to be associated with either 
proliferation or apoptosis, respectively. The present bioinformatic analysis was 
performed to decipher the gene networks involved to obtain a deeper 
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the proliferative and apoptosis 
processes. Our findings have revealed 116 putative transcription factors (TFs) 
and the most significant number of interactions between these TFs and DEGs 
belong to NFKβ1, TP53, STAT1, and HIF1A. Moreover, our results provide novel 
insights into the early signaling and metabolic pathways in bovine endometrial 
epithelial cells associated with the innate immune response and cell 
proliferation to Escherichia coli-LPS infection. The results further indicated 
that LPS challenge elicited a strong transcriptomic response, leading to potent 
activation of pro-inflammatory pathways that are associated with a marked 
endometrial cancer, Toll-like receptor, NFKβ, AKT, apoptosis, and MAPK signaling 
pathways. This effect may provide a mechanistic explanation for the relationship 
between LPS and cell proliferation."
1624,"Ethyl acetate is an important flavor element that is a vital component of 
baijiu. To date, the transcription factors that can help identify the molecular 
mechanisms involved in the synthesis of ethyl acetate have not been studied. In 
the present study, we sequenced and assembled the Wickerhamomyces anomalus 
strain YF1503 transcriptomes to identify transcription factors. We identified 
307 transcription factors in YF1503 using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Some 
transcription factors, such as C2H2, bHLH, MYB, and bZIP, were up-regulated, and 
these might play a role in ethyl acetate synthesis. According to the trend of 
ethyl acetate content, heat map results and STEM, twelve genes were selected for 
verification of expression levels using quantitative real-time PCR. This dynamic 
transcriptome analysis presents fundamental information on the transcription 
factors and pathways that are involved in the synthesis of ethyl acetate in 
aroma-producing yeast. Of significant interest is the discovery of the roles of 
various transcription factor genes in the synthesis of ethyl acetate."
1625,"Donkeys, with high economic value for meat, skin and milk production, are 
important livestock. However, the current insights into reproduction of donkeys 
are far from enough. To obtain a deeper understanding, the differential 
expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of 
transcriptomic data of testicular and epididymis tissues in donkeys were 
performed. In the result, there were 4313 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
in the two tissues, including 2047 enriched in testicular tissue and 2266 in 
epididymis tissue. WGCNA identified 1081 hub genes associated with testis 
development and 6110 genes with epididymal development. Next, the 
tissue-specific genes were identified with the above two methods, and the gene 
ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the epididymal-specific genes were 
associated with gonad development. On the other hand, the testis-specific genes 
were involved in the formation of sperm flagella, meiosis period, ciliary 
assembly, ciliary movement, etc. In addition, we found that eca-Mir-711 and 
eca-Mir-143 likely participated in regulating the development of epididymal 
tissue. Meanwhile, eca-Mir-429, eca-Mir-761, eca-Mir-200a, eca-Mir-191 and 
eca-Mir-200b potentially played an important role in regulating the development 
of testicular tissue. In short, these results will contribute to functional 
studies of the male reproductive trait in donkeys."
1626,"As next-generation sequencing technology becomes more mature and the cost of 
sequencing continues to fall, researchers are increasingly using mitochondrial 
genomes to explore phylogenetic relationships among different groups. In this 
study, we sequenced and analyzed the complete mitochondrial genomes of Eupelmus 
anpingensis and Merostenus sp. We predicted the secondary-structure tRNA genes 
of these two species and found that 21 of the 22 tRNA genes in Merostenus sp. 
exhibited typical clover-leaf structures, with trnS1 being the lone exception. 
In E. anpingensis, we found that, in addition to trnS1, the secondary structure 
of trnE was also incomplete, with only DHU arms and anticodon loop remaining. In 
addition, we found that compositional heterogeneity and variable rates of 
evolution are prevalent in Chalcidoidea. Under the homogeneity model, a 
Eupelmidae + Encyrtidae sister group relationship was proposed. Different 
datasets based on the heterogeneity model produced different tree topologies, 
but all tree topologies contained Chalcididae and Trichogrammatidae in the basal 
position of the tree. This is the first study to consider the phylogenetic 
relationships of Chalcidoidea by comparing a heterogeneity model with a 
homogeneity model."
1627,"Traditional transcriptomics approaches have been used to identify candidate 
genes affecting economically important livestock traits. Regulatory variants 
affecting these traits, however, remain under covered. Genomic regions showing 
allele-specific expression (ASE) are under the effect of cis-regulatory 
variants, being useful for improving the accuracy of genomic selection models. 
Taking advantage of the better of these two methods, we investigated single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in regions showing differential ASE (DASE SNPs) 
between contrasting groups for beef quality traits. For these analyses, we used 
RNA sequencing data, imputed genotypes and genomic estimated breeding values of 
muscle-related traits from 190 Nelore (Bos indicus) steers. We selected 40 
contrasting unrelated samples for the analysis (N = 20 animals per contrasting 
group) and used a beta-binomial model to identify ASE SNPs in only one group 
(i.e., DASE SNPs). We found 1479 DASE SNPs (FDR ≤ 0.05) associated with 55 
beef-quality traits. Most DASE genes were involved with tenderness and muscle 
homeostasis, presenting a co-expression module enriched for the protein 
ubiquitination process. The results overlapped with epigenetics and 
phenotype-associated data, suggesting that DASE SNPs are potentially linked to 
cis-regulatory variants affecting simultaneously the transcription and phenotype 
through chromatin state modulation."
1628,"Phortica okadai, a polyphagous pest, serves as a vector for Thelazia callipaeda 
in China. Currently, there are no effective control strategies for this vector. 
Agricultural pest control may cause P. okadai to become a threat due to the 
development of pesticide resistance. Cytochrome P450s (CYP450) plays a 
significant role in detoxifying xenobiotics in insects. In this study, we 
performed RNA sequencing of P. okadai exposed to β-cypermethrin for 0 and 1 h 
and then gene cloning of the five up-regulated CYP450 genes. Three CYP450 genes 
were successfully cloned, and their expression patterns in different 
developmental stages and in different tissues were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Pocyp4d2 
was observed to have the highest expression in the midgut (fold change 2.82 for 
Pocyp4d2, 2.62 for Pocyp49a1, and 1.77 for Pocyp28d2). Functional analysis was 
carried out according to overexpression in S2 cells from the pfastbac1 vector 
and RNAi with siRNA. The results of the CCK8 assay indicated that the 
overexpression of the recombinant protein PoCYP4D2 suppressed the decrease in S2 
cell viability due to β-cypermethrin. The expression levels of PoCYP4D2 
decreased significantly, and the mortality rates increased from 6.25% to 15.0% 
at 3 h and from 15.0% to 27.5% at 6 h after Pocyp4d2-siRNA injection. These 
results suggest that Pocyp4d2 may be an essential key gene in the metabolism of 
β-cypermethrin in P. okadai. This study constitutes a foundation to explore 
further the functions of P. okadai CYP450 genes in insecticide metabolism."
1629,"Melatonin (MEL) presents well-documented pleiotropic actions against oxidative 
stress (OS), acting indirectly through activation of transcription factors, 
e.g., FoxO3 and Nrf2. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the possible 
modulating effects of MEL on the redox signaling pathways PI3K/AKT/FoxO3 and 
Keap1/Nrf2/ARE in K562 erythroleukemic cells subjected to OS induction. For 
this, the viability, and transcript levels of genes involved in redox adaptation 
were evaluated in K562 cells in different periods of erythroid differentiation: 
under OS induction by hydrogen peroxide (100 µM H2O2); treated with 1 nM (C1) 
and 1 mM (C2) MEL; and associated or not with stress induction. We observed a 
restoration of physiological levels of Nrf2 in both MEL concentrations under OS. 
The C1 was related to enhanced expression of antioxidant and proteasome genes 
through the Nrf2-ARE pathway, while C2 to the induction of FOXO3 expression, 
suggesting an involvement with apoptotic pathway, according to BIM transcript 
levels. The effects of MEL administration in these cells showed a period and 
dose-dependent pattern against induced-OS, with direct and indirect actions 
through different pathways of cellular adaptation, reinforcing the importance of 
this indolamine in the regulation of cellular homeostasis, being a promising 
therapeutic alternative for diseases that present an exacerbated OS."
1630,"Digitalis purpurea L. is a therapeutically important plant that synthesizes 
important cardiotonics such as digitoxin and digoxin. The present work reports a 
detailed and efficient propagation protocol for D. purpurea by optimizing 
various PGR concentrations in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. The genetic 
homogeneity of in vitro regenerants was assessed by the flow cytometric method 
(FCM) and Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) marker technique. Firstly, the seeds 
inoculated in full MS medium added with 0.5 mg/L GA3 produced seedlings. 
Different parts such as hypocotyl, nodes, leaves and apical shoots were used as 
explants. The compact calli were obtained on BAP alone or in combinations with 
2, 4-D/NAA. The hypocotyl-derived callus induced somatic embryos which 
proliferated and germinated best in 0.75 mg/L BAP-fortified MS medium. Scanning 
electron microscopic (SEM) images confirmed the presence of various 
developmental stages of somatic embryos. Shoot regeneration was obtained in 
which BAP at 1.0 mg/L and 2.0 mg/L BAP + 0.5 mg/L 2,4-D proved to be the best 
treatments of PGRs in inducing direct and indirect shoot buds. The regenerated 
shoots showed the highest rooting percentage (87.5%) with 24.7 ± 1.9 numbers of 
roots/shoot in 1.0 mg/L IBA augmented medium. The rooted plantlets were 
acclimatized in a greenhouse at a survival rate of 85-90%. The genome size and 
the 2C nuclear DNA content of field-grown, somatic embryo-regenerated and 
organogenic-derived plants were estimated and noted to be 3.1, 3.2 and 3.0 
picogram (pg), respectively; there is no alteration in ploidy status and the DNA 
content, validating genetic uniformity. Six SCoT primers unveiled 94.3%-95.13% 
monomorphic bands across all the plant samples analyzed, further indicating 
genetic stability among in vitro clones and mother plants. This study describes 
for the first time successful induction of somatic embryos from hypocotyl 
callus; and flow cytometry and SCoT marker confirmed the genetic homogeneity of 
regenerated plants."
1631,"BACKGROUND: Aortic root dilation (ARD) has been described in 22q11.2DS, even 
without congenital heart disease (CHD). However, the clinical implications and 
longitudinal course are unclear. In this study, we evaluated aortic root (AR) 
dimensions in 22q112.DS adolescents/adults without major intracardiac CHDs, 
analyzed the progression over time and investigated correlations with 
extracardiac comorbidities.
METHODS: AR dimensions were evaluated in 74 patients, measuring the sinus of 
Valsalva (VS) and proximal ascending aorta (AA), using Z-score to define mild, 
moderate and severe degrees. Changes in AR dimensions during longitudinal 
echocardiographic follow-up were investigated. Phenotypic characteristics have 
been collected.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (32.4%) showed ARD in terms of VS Z-score (2.43; 
IQR 2.08-3.01), eight (33.3%) of a moderate/severe degree. Thirteen (54.2%) had 
concomitant AAD (Z-score 2.34; IQR 1.60-2.85). The risk of ARD was significantly 
directly related to skeletal/connective tissue disorders (OR 12.82, 95% CI 
1.43-115.31; p = 0.023) and inversely related to BMI (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.97; 
p = 0.011). A significant increase in AR diameter's absolute value (p = 0.001) 
over time has been detected.
CONCLUSION: Isolated ARD is common in 22q11.2DS. Although some clinical risk 
factors have been identified, pathogenetic mechanisms and risk of complications 
are undefined. Regular cardiac evaluations should be part of the 22q11.2DS 
follow-up, and also in non-CHDs patients, to improve long-term outcome."
1632,"Cirrhosis is frequently the final stage of disease preceding the development of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is one of the risk factors for HCC. 
Preventive surveillance for early HCC in patients with cirrhosis is advantageous 
for achieving early HCC prevention and diagnosis, thereby enhancing patient 
prognosis and reducing mortality. However, there is no highly sensitive 
diagnostic marker for the clinical surveillance of HCC in patients with 
cirrhosis, which significantly restricts its use in primary care for HCC. To 
increase the accuracy of illness diagnosis, the study of the effective and 
sensitive genetic biomarkers involved in HCC incidence is crucial. In this 
study, a set of 120 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was 
identified in the GSE121248 dataset. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
was constructed among the DEGs, and Cytoscape was used to extract hub genes from 
the network. In TCGA database, the expression levels, correlation analysis, and 
predictive performance of hub genes were validated. In total, 15 hub genes 
showed increased expression, and their positive correlation ranged from 0.80 to 
0.90, suggesting they may be involved in the same signaling pathway governing 
HBV-related HCC. The GSE10143, GSE25097, GSE54236, and GSE17548 datasets were 
used to investigate the expression pattern of these hub genes in the progression 
from cirrhosis to HCC. Using Cox regression analysis, a prediction model was 
then developed. The ROC curves, DCA, and calibration analysis demonstrated the 
superior disease prediction accuracy of this model. In addition, using proteomic 
analysis, we investigated whether these key hub genes interact with the 
HBV-encoded oncogene X protein (HBx), the oncogenic protein in HCC. We 
constructed stable HBx-expressing LO2-HBx and Huh-7-HBx cell lines. 
Co-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (Co-IP/MS) results 
demonstrated that CDK1, RRM2, ANLN, and HMMR interacted specifically with HBx in 
both cell models. Importantly, we investigated 15 potential key genes (CCNB1, 
CDK1, BUB1B, ECT2, RACGAP1, ANLN, PBK, TOP2A, ASPM, RRM2, NEK2, PRC1, SPP1, 
HMMR, and DTL) participating in the transformation process of HBV infection to 
HCC, of which 4 hub genes (CDK1, RRM2, ANLN, and HMMR) probably serve as 
potential oncogenic HBx downstream target molecules. All these findings of our 
study provided valuable research direction for the diagnostic gene detection of 
HBV-related HCC in primary care surveillance for HCC in patients with cirrhosis."
1633,"Bacteriocins are gaining immense importance in therapeutics since they show 
significant antibacterial potential. This study reports the bacteriocin KAE01 
from Enterococcus faecium, along with its characterization, molecular modeling, 
and antibacterial potency, by targeting the matrix protein of Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa. The bacteriocin was purified by using ammonium sulfate precipitation 
and fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), and its molecular weight was 
estimated as 55 kDa by means of SDS-PAGE. The bacteriocin was found to show 
stability in a wide range of pH values (2.0-10.0) and temperatures (100 °C for 1 
h and 121 °C for 15 min). Antimicrobial screening of the purified peptide 
against different strains of P. aeruginosa showed its significant antibacterial 
potential. Scanning electron microscopy of bacteriocin-induced bacterial 
cultures revealed significant changes in the cellular morphology of the 
pathogens. In silico molecular modeling of KAE01, followed by molecular docking 
of the matrix protein (qSA) of P. aeruginosa and KAE01, supported the 
antibacterial potency and SEM findings of this study."
1634,"CUB and Sushi Multiple Domains 1 (CSMD1), a tumour suppressor gene, encodes a 
large membrane-bound protein including a single transmembrane domain. This 
transmembrane region has a potential tyrosine phosphorylation site, suggesting 
that CSMD1 is involved in controlling cellular functions. Although the specific 
mechanisms of action for CSMD1 have not yet been uncovered, it has been linked 
to a number of processes including development, complement control, 
neurodevelopment, and cancer progression. In this review, we summarise CSMD1 
functions in the cellular processes involved in the complement system, 
metastasis, and Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and also in the diseases 
schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and cancer. Clarifying the association 
between CSMD1 and the aforementioned diseases will contribute to the development 
of new diagnosis and treatment methods for these diseases. Recent studies in 
certain cancer types, e.g., gastric cancer, oesophageal cancer, and head and 
neck squamous cell carcinomas, have indicated the involvement of CSMD1 in 
response to immunotherapy."
1635,"Mineral malnutrition is a major problem in many rice-consuming countries. It is 
essential to know the genetic mechanisms of accumulation of mineral elements in 
the rice grain to provide future solutions for this issue. This study was 
conducted to identify the genetic basis of six mineral elements (Cu, Fe, K, Mg, 
Mn, and Zn) by using three models for single-locus and six models for 
multi-locus analysis of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 174 diverse 
rice accessions and 6565 SNP markers. To declare a SNP as significant, -log10(P) 
≥ 3.0 and 15% FDR significance cut-off values were used for single-locus models, 
while LOD ≥ 3.0 was used for multi-locus models. Using these criteria, 147 SNPs 
were detected by one or two GWAS methods at -log10(P) ≥ 3.0, 48 of which met the 
15% FDR significance cut-off value. Single-locus models outperformed multi-locus 
models before applying multi-test correction, but once applied, multi-locus 
models performed better. While 14 (~29%) of the identified quantitative trait 
loci (QTLs) after multiple test correction co-located with previously reported 
genes/QTLs and marker associations, another 34 trait-associated SNPs were novel. 
After mining genes within 250 kb of the 48 significant SNP loci, in silico and 
gene enrichment analyses were conducted to predict their potential functions. 
These shortlisted genes with their functions could guide future experimental 
validation, helping us to understand the complex molecular mechanisms 
controlling rice grain mineral elements."
1636,"The spoligotype is a graphical description of the CRISPR locus present in 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has the particularity of having only 68 
possible spacers. This spoligotype, which can be easily obtained either in vitro 
or in silico, allows to have a summary information of lineage or even antibiotic 
resistance (when known to be associated to a particular cluster) at a lower 
cost. The objective of this article is to show that this representation is 
richer than it seems, and that it is under-exploited until now. We first recall 
an original way to represent these spoligotypes as points in the plane, allowing 
to highlight possible sub-lineages, particularities in the animal strains, etc. 
This graphical representation shows clusters and a skeleton in the form of a 
graph, which led us to see these spoligotypes as vertices of an unconnected 
directed graph. In this paper, we therefore propose to exploit in detail the 
description of the variety of spoligotypes using a graph, and we show to what 
extent such a description can be informative."
1637,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by 
a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Patients with 
FAP develop up to thousands of colorectal adenomas as well as lesions in the 
upper GI tract. In FAP, the upper digestive lesions include gastric fundic gland 
polyps (FGPs), antrum adenomas, duodenal or small intestinal adenomas, and 
carcinoma. Patients, after colectomy, are still at significant risk for 
extracolonic malignancies. Advances in endoscope resolution and optical 
enhancement technologies allow endoscopists to provide assessments of benign and 
malignant polyps. For this reason, in the past decades, endoscopic resection 
techniques have become the first line of treatment in patients with polyps in 
the upper GI, whereby polyps and even early cancers can be successfully cured. 
In FAP patients, endoscopic ampullectomy appears to be a safe and effective way 
of treating patients with ampullary tumors. According to current indications, 
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stenting of the main 
pancreatic duct follow ampullectomy."
1638,"Background: Chemoresistance is a significant barrier to combating head and neck 
cancer, and decoding this resistance can widen the therapeutic application of 
such chemotherapeutic drugs. This systematic review and meta-analysis explores 
the influence of microRNA (miRNA) expressions on chemoresistance in head and 
neck cancers (HNC). The objective is to evaluate the theragnostic effects of 
microRNA expressions on chemoresistance in HNC patients and investigate the 
utility of miRNAs as biomarkers and avenues for new therapeutic targets. 
Methods: We performed a comprehensive bibliographic search that included the 
SCOPUS, PubMed, and Science Direct bibliographic databases. These searches 
conformed to a predefined set of search strategies. Following the PRISMA 
guidelines, inclusion and exclusion criteria were framed upon completing the 
literature search. The data items extracted were tabulated and collated in MS 
Excel. This spreadsheet was used to determine the effect size estimation for the 
theragnostic effects of miRNA expressions on chemoresistance in HNC, the hazard 
ratio (HR), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The comprehensive 
meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model. Heterogeneity among 
the data collected was assessed using the Q test, Tau2, I2, and Z measures. 
Publication bias of the included studies was checked using the Egger's bias 
indicator test, Orwin and classic fail-safe N test, Begg and Mazumdar rank 
collection test, and Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill methods. Results: After 
collating the data from 23 studies, dysregulation of 34 miRNAs was observed in 
2189 people. These data were gathered from 23 studies. Out of the 34 miRNAs 
considered, 22 were up-regulated, while 12 were down-regulated. The TaqMan 
transcription kits were the most used miRNA profiling platform, and miR-200c was 
seen to have a mixed dysregulation. We measured the overall pooled effect 
estimate of HR to be 1.516 for the various analyzed miRNA at a 95% confidence 
interval of 1.303-1.765, with a significant p-value. The null hypothesis test's 
Z value was 5.377, and the p-value was correspondingly noted to be less than 
0.0001. This outcome indicates that the risk of death is determined to be higher 
in up-regulated groups than in down-regulated groups. Among the 34 miRNAs that 
were investigated, seven miRNAs were associated with an improved prognosis, 
especially with the overexpression of these seven miRNAs (miR15b-5p, miR-548b, 
miR-519d, miR-1278, miR-145, miR-200c, Hsa- miR139-3p). Discussion: The findings 
reveal that intricate relationships between miRNAs' expression and 
chemotherapeutic resistance in HNC are more likely to exist and can be potential 
therapeutic targets. This review suggests the involvement of specific miRNAs as 
predictors of chemoresistance and sensitivity in HNC. The examination of the 
current study results illustrates the significance of miRNA expression as a 
theragnostic biomarker in medical oncology."
1639,"To keep pace with the rapid advancements in molecular genetics and rare diseases 
research, we have updated the list of ectodermal dysplasias based on the latest 
classification approach that was adopted in 2017 by an international panel of 
experts. For this purpose, we searched the databases PubMed and OMIM for the 
term ""ectodermal dysplasia"", referring mainly to changes in the last 5 years. We 
also tried to obtain information about those diseases on which the last 
scientific report appeared more than 15 years ago by contacting the authors of 
the most recent publication. A group of experts, composed of researchers who 
attended the 8th International Conference on Ectodermal Dysplasias and 
additional members of the previous classification panel, reviewed the proposed 
amendments and agreed on a final table listing all 49 currently known ectodermal 
dysplasias for which the molecular genetic basis has been clarified, including 
15 new entities. A newly reported ectodermal dysplasia, linked to the gene LRP6, 
is described here in more detail. These ectodermal dysplasias, in the strict 
sense, should be distinguished from syndromes with features of ectodermal 
dysplasia that are related to genes extraneous to the currently known pathways 
involved in ectodermal development. The latter group consists of 34 syndromes 
which had been placed on the previous list of ectodermal dysplasias, but most if 
not all of them could actually be classified elsewhere. This update should 
streamline the classification of ectodermal dysplasias, provide guidance to the 
correct diagnosis of rare disease entities, and facilitate the identification of 
individuals who could benefit from novel treatment options."
1640,"Cancer is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. A strong 
predisposition to cancer is generally only observed in colorectal cancer (5% of 
cases) and breast cancer (2% of cases). Colorectal cancer is the most common 
cancer with a strong genetic predisposition, but it includes dozens of various 
syndromes. This group includes familial adenomatous polyposis, attenuated 
familial adenomatous polyposis, MUTYH-associated polyposis, NTHL1-associated 
polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis syndrome, Cowden syndrome, 
Lynch syndrome, and Muir-Torre syndrome. The common symptom of all these 
diseases is a very high risk of colorectal cancer, but depending on the 
condition, their course is different in terms of age and range of cancer 
occurrence. The rate of cancer development is determined by its conditioning 
genes, too. Hereditary predispositions to cancer of the intestine are a group of 
symptoms of heterogeneous diseases, and their proper diagnosis is crucial for 
the appropriate management of patients and their successful treatment. Mutations 
of specific genes cause strong colorectal cancer predispositions. Identifying 
mutations of predisposing genes will support proper diagnosis and application of 
appropriate screening programs to avoid malignant neoplasm."
1641,"The fast-growing arbor poplar is widely distributed across the world and is 
susceptible to nitrogen availability. The WRKY transcription factor is an 
important regulatory node of stress tolerance as well as nutrient utilization. 
However, the potential response mechanism of WRKY genes toward nitrogen is 
poorly understood. Therefore, the identification of WRKY genes on the Populus 
trichocarpa genome was performed, and 98 PtWRKYs (i.e., PtWRKY1 to PtWRKY98) 
were identified. Phylogenetic analysis and the promoter cis-acting element 
detection revealed that PtWRKYs have multiple functions, including phosphorus 
and nitrogen homeostasis. By constructing multilayer-hierarchical gene 
regulatory networks (ML-hGRNs), it was predicted that many WRKY transcription 
factors were involved in the nitrogen response, such as PtWRKY33 and PtWRKY95. 
They mainly regulated the expression of primary nitrogen-responsive genes 
(NRGs), such as PtNRT2.5A, PtNR2 and PtGLT2. The integrative analysis of 
transcriptome and RT-qPCR results show that the expression levels of 6 and 15 
PtWRKYs were regulated by nitrogen availability in roots and leaves, 
respectively, and those were also found in ML-hGRN. Our study demonstrates that 
PtWRKYs respond to nitrogen by regulating NRGs, which enriches the 
nitrate-responsive transcription factor network and helps to uncover the hub of 
nitrate and its related signaling regulation."
1642,"The binding of microRNAs (miRNAs) to their target sites is a complex process, 
mediated by the Argonaute (Ago) family of proteins. The prediction of 
miRNA:target site binding is an important first step for any miRNA target 
prediction algorithm. To date, the potential for miRNA:target site binding is 
evaluated using either co-folding free energy measures or heuristic approaches, 
based on the identification of binding 'seeds', i.e., continuous stretches of 
binding corresponding to specific parts of the miRNA. The limitations of both 
these families of methods have produced generations of miRNA target prediction 
algorithms that are primarily focused on 'canonical' seed targets, even though 
unbiased experimental methods have shown that only approximately half of in vivo 
miRNA targets are 'canonical'. Herein, we present miRBind, a deep learning 
method and web server that can be used to accurately predict the potential of 
miRNA:target site binding. We trained our method using seed-agnostic 
experimental data and show that our method outperforms both seed-based 
approaches and co-fold free energy approaches. The full code for the development 
of miRBind and a freely accessible web server are freely available."
1643,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a severe disease with elevated morbidity 
and mortality rate worldwide. This is attributed to great losses of 
cardiomyocytes, which can trigger the alteration of gene expression patterns. 
Although several attempts have been made to assess the AMI biomarkers, to date 
their role in rescuing myocardial injury remains unclear. Therefore, the current 
study investigated three independent microarray-based gene expression datasets 
from AMI patients (n = 85) and their age-sex-matched healthy controls (n = 70), 
to identify novel gene signatures that might be involved in cardioprotection. 
The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using 'GEO2R', and 
weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify 
biomarkers/modules. We found 91 DEGs, of which the number of upregulated and 
downregulated genes were 22 and 5, respectively. Specifically, we found that the 
deregulated genes such as ADOR-A3, BMP6, VPS8, and GPx3, may be associated with 
AMI. WGCNA revealed four highly preserved modules among all datasets. The 
'Enrichr' unveiled the presence of miR-660 and STAT1, which is known to affect 
AMI severity. Conclusively, these genes and miRNA might play a crucial role the 
rescue of cardiomyocytes from severe damage, which could be helpful in 
developing appropriate therapeutic strategies for the management of AMI."
1644,"Transmission ratio distortion (TRD), or significant deviations from Mendelian 
inheritance, is a well-studied phenomenon on autosomal chromosomes, but has not 
yet received attention on sex chromosomes. TRD was analyzed on 3832 heterosomal 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 400 pseudoautosomal SNPs spanning the 
length of the X-chromosome using 436,651 genotyped Holstein cattle. On the 
pseudoautosomal region, an opposite sire-TRD pattern between male and female 
offspring was identified for 149 SNPs. This finding revealed unique SNPs linked 
to a specific-sex (Y- or X-) chromosome and describes the accumulation of 
recombination events across the pseudoautosomal region. On the heterosomal 
region, 13 SNPs and 69 haplotype windows were identified with dam-TRD. 
Functional analyses for TRD regions highlighted relevant biological functions 
responsible to regulate spermatogenesis, development of Sertoli cells, 
homeostasis of endometrium tissue and embryonic development. This study 
uncovered the prevalence of different TRD patterns across both heterosomal and 
pseudoautosomal regions of the X-chromosome and revealed functional candidate 
genes for bovine reproduction."
1645,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are highly conserved essential enzymes that 
charge tRNA with cognate amino acids-the first step of protein synthesis. Of the 
37 nuclear-encoded human ARS genes, 17 encode enzymes are exclusively targeted 
to the mitochondria (mt-ARSs). Mutations in nuclear mt-ARS genes are associated 
with rare, recessive human diseases with a broad range of clinical phenotypes. 
While the hypothesized disease mechanism is a loss-of-function effect, there is 
significant clinical heterogeneity among patients that have mutations in 
different mt-ARS genes and also among patients that have mutations in the same 
mt-ARS gene. This observation suggests that additional factors are involved in 
disease etiology. In this review, we present our current understanding of 
diseases caused by mutations in the genes encoding mt-ARSs and propose 
explanations for the observed clinical heterogeneity."
1646,"MiR-21 and miR-375 have been reported as dysregulated in prostate cancer (PCa) 
in multiple previous studies. Still, variable or even opposing data for the 
expression of these microRNAs in PCa were found, and their potential biomarker 
properties remain elusive. In an attempt to clarify their significance as PCa 
biomarkers, as well as to compare different types of specimens as a source of 
relevant microRNAs, we used plasma and matching plasma-derived exosomes from 
patients with PCa and patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Plasma 
and exosomes were obtained from 34 patients with PCa and 34 patients with BPH, 
and their levels of expression of miR-21 and miR-375 were determined by RT-qPCR. 
We found no significant difference in the level of expression of these microRNAs 
in plasma and exosomes between patients with PCa and BPH. The level of exosomal 
miR-21 was elevated in PCa patients with high serum PSA values, as well as in 
patients with aggressive PCa, while for plasma samples, the results remained 
insignificant. For miR-375, we did not find an association with the values of 
standard prognostic parameters of PCa, nor with cancer aggressiveness. 
Therefore, our results support the potential prognostic role of exosomal miR-21 
expression levels in PCa."
1647,"Ampelopsis grossedentata leaves are highly rich in dihydromyricetin. They have 
been used to make tea in China for centuries. Dihydromyricetin has many 
potential applications in foods and medicine. This are because it has five 
phenolic hydroxyl groups. However, the hydroxylases involving the biosynthesis 
of dihydromyricetin have not been identified and characterized. In this study, a 
series of hydroxylases genes, including flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonoid 
3'-hydroxylase (F3'H), flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H), and cytochrome P450 
reductase (CPR), were identified after RNA sequencing. The full-length CDSs of 
AgF3H, AgF3'H, AgF3'5'H, and AgCPR genes were amplified from the cDNA library of 
leaves. The aforementioned enzymes were expressed and verified in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. Through the substrate specificity assay, the functional AgF3'H, 
AgF3'5'H, and AgCPR in A. grossedentata were identified. The dihydromyricetin 
hydroxylation process in A. grossedentata was successfully identified. We found 
that substantial carbon flux occurred through the Naringenin (NAR)-Eriodictyol 
(ERI)-Dihydroquercetin (DHQ)-Dihydromyricetin (DHM) and NAR-Dihydrokaempferol 
(DHK)-DHQ-DHM pathways. This study provides some reference for the development 
and utilization of the germplasm resources and molecular breeding of A. 
grossedentata."
1648,"The high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technique is widely 
used to study the functional roles of the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of 
genomes. However, the knowledge of the 3D genome structure and its dynamics 
during extreme environmental adaptations remains poor. Here, we characterized 3D 
genome architectures using the Hi-C technique for chicken liver cells. Upon 
comparing Lindian chicken (LDC) liver cells with Wenchang chicken (WCC) liver 
cells, we discovered that environmental adaptation contributed to the switching 
of A/B compartments, the reorganization of topologically associated domains 
(TADs), and TAD boundaries in both liver cells. In addition, the analysis of the 
switching of A/B compartments revealed that the switched compartmental genes 
(SCGs) were strongly associated with extreme environment adaption-related 
pathways, including tight junction, notch signaling pathway, vascular smooth 
muscle contraction, and the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway. The findings 
of this study advanced our understanding of the evolutionary role of chicken 3D 
genome architecture and its significance in genome activity and transcriptional 
regulation."
1649,"Fowl adenovirus 4 (FAdV-4) has the potential to be constructed as a gene 
transfer vector for human gene therapy or vaccine development to avoid the 
pre-existing immunity to human adenoviruses. To enhance the transduction of 
FAdV-4 to human cells, CELO fiber1 knob (CF1K) was chosen to replace the fiber2 
knob in FAdV-4 to generate recombinant virus F2CF1K-CG. The original FAdV4-CG 
virus transduced 4% human 293 or 1% HEp-2 cells at the multiplicity of infection 
of 1000 viral particles per cell. In contrast, F2CF1K-CG could transduce 98% 293 
or 60% HEp-2 cells under the same conditions. Prokaryotically expressed CF1K 
protein blocked 50% transduction of F2CF1K-CG to 293 cells at a concentration of 
1.3 µg/mL while it only slightly inhibited the infection of human adenovirus 5 
(HAdV-5), suggesting CF1K could bind to human cells in a manner different from 
HAdV-5 fiber. The incorporation of CF1K had no negative effect on the growth of 
FAdV-4 in the packaging cells. In addition, CF1K-pseudotyped HAdV-41 could 
transduce HEp-2 and A549 cells more efficiently. These data indicated that CF1K 
had the priority to be considered when there is a need to modify adenovirus 
tropism."
1650,"(1) Objective: To investigate the prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling for 
16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome and to evaluate its pregnancy outcome. (2) 
Methods: This study included 4968 pregnant women who selected invasive prenatal 
diagnoses from 1 January 2017 to 1 August 2022. These 4698 pregnancies underwent 
chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), data on 81 fetuses diagnosed with 16p11.2 
microdeletion syndrome based on prenatal ultrasound features and genetic test 
results were recorded, and their pregnancy outcome was evaluated. (3) Results: 
1.63% of fetuses (81/4968) were diagnosed with 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome. 
Among these, there were skeletal malformations in 48.15% of the 81 fetuses, 
cardiovascular malformations in 30.86%, central nervous system malformations 
(CNS) in 11.11%, digestive system structural abnormalities in 6.17%, and 
isolated ultrasonography markers in 3.70%. (4) Conclusions: 16p11.2 
microdeletion syndrome can display various systemic ultrasound abnormalities in 
the perinatal period but vertebral malformations are the most common. Our study 
is the first to report that TBX1 and CJA5 are associated with 16p11.2 
microdeletion syndrome, expanding the disease spectrum of 16p11.2 microdeletion 
syndrome. In our study, the ventricular septal defect is the main feature of 
cardiac structural abnormalities caused by 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome. In 
addition, our study highlights the use of CMA in 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome, 
analyzed their genetic results, and evaluated the follow-up prognosis, which can 
be useful for prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling."
1651,"Filamin protein is characterized by an N-terminal actin-binding domain that is 
followed by 24 Ig (immunoglobulin)-like repeats, which act as hubs for 
interactions with a variety of proteins. In humans, this family has been found 
to be involved in cancer cell invasion and metastasis and can be involved in a 
variety of growth signal transduction processes, but it is less studied in 
plants. Therefore, in this study, 54 Filamin gene family members from 23 plant 
species were investigated and divided into two subfamilies: FLMN and GEX2. 
Subcellular localization showed that most of the Filamin gene family members 
were located in the cell membrane. A total of 47 Filamin gene pairs were 
identified, most of which were whole-genome copies. Through the analyses of 
cis-acting elements, expression patterns and quantitative fluorescence, it was 
found that GH_ A02G0519 and GH_ D02G0539 are mainly expressed in the 
reproductive organs of upland cotton, and their interacting proteins are also 
related to the fertilization process, whereas GH_A02G0216 and GH_D02G0235 were 
related to stress. Thus, it is speculated that two genes of the GEX2 subfamily 
(GH_A02G0519 and GH_D02G0539) may be involved in the reproductive development of 
cotton and may affect the fertilization process of cotton. This study provides a 
theoretical basis for the further study of the cotton Filamin gene family."
1652,"The breast muscle is essential for flight and determines the meat yield and 
quality of the meat type in pigeons. At present, studies about long non-coding 
RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles in skeletal muscles across the postnatal 
development of pigeons have not been reported. Here, we used transcriptome 
sequencing to examine the White-King pigeon breast muscle at four different ages 
(1 day, 14 days, 28 days, and 2 years old). We identified 12,918 mRNAs and 9158 
lncRNAs (5492 known lncRNAs and 3666 novel lncRNAs) in the breast muscle, and 
7352 mRNAs and 4494 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in the process of 
development. We found that highly expressed mRNAs were mainly related to 
cell-basic and muscle-specific functions. Differential expression and 
time-series analysis showed that differentially expressed genes were primarily 
associated with muscle development and functions, blood vessel development, cell 
cycle, and energy metabolism. To further predict the possible role of lncRNAs, 
we also conducted the WGCNA and trans/cis analyses. We found that differentially 
expressed lncRNAs such as lncRNA-LOC102093252, lncRNA-G12653, 
lncRNA-LOC110357465, lncRNA-G14790, and lncRNA-LOC110360188 might respectively 
target UBE2B, Pax7, AGTR2, HDAC1, Sox8 and participate in the development of the 
muscle. Our study provides a valuable resource for studying the lncRNAs and 
mRNAs of pigeon muscles and for improving the understanding of molecular 
mechanisms in muscle development."
1653,"The RNA methylation of adenosine at the N6-position (m6A) has attracted 
significant attention because of its abundance and dynamic nature. It accounts 
for more than 80% of all RNA modifications present in bacteria and eukaryotes 
and regulates crucial aspects of RNA biology and gene expression in numerous 
biological processes. The majority of m6A found in mammals is deposited by a 
multicomponent complex formed between methyltransferase-like (METTL) proteins 
METTL3 and METTL14. In the last few years, the list of m6A writers has grown, 
resulting in an expansion of our understanding of the importance of m6A and the 
methylation machinery. The characterization of the less familiar family member 
METTL16 has uncovered a new function of the m6A methylation apparatus, namely 
the fine-tuning of the cellular levels of the major methyl donor 
S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). METTL16 achieves this by adjusting the levels of the 
enzyme that synthesizes SAM in direct response to fluctuations in the SAM 
availability. This review summarizes recent progress made in understanding how 
METTL16 can sense and relay metabolic information and considers the wider 
implications. A brief survey highlights similarities and differences between 
METTL16 and the better-known METTL3/14 complex, followed by a discussion of the 
target specificity, modes of action and potential roles of METTL16."
1654,"In the highlands of Bolivia, native Festuca species are an important source of 
feed for animals due to their high tolerance to low temperatures and drought. 
Using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed from expressed sequence 
tags (ESTs), the genetic diversity of 43 populations of Festuca species from 
Oruro, La Paz, Potosi and Cochabamba departments was evaluated for the purpose 
of providing information for effective conservation and breeding. In total, 64 
alleles were detected across the 43 populations. SSR locus NFA 142 (with 12 
alleles) had the highest number of detected alleles, while locus FES 13 (with 
eight alleles) had the highest polymorphism information content (PIC) at 0.55. 
Based on Nei's genetic distance between populations, the unweighted pair group 
method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) cluster analysis revealed two major 
clusters, each consisting of populations from the four departments. However, the 
analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that only 5% of the total 
variation separated these two groups, indicating low genetic differentiation 
between the populations. It was also found that there was a low but significant 
differentiation (0.08%) between the population groups of the four departments (p 
= 0.01). The newly developed EST-SSR markers are highly valuable for evaluating 
the genetic diversity of Bolivian fescues and other related species."
1655,"As a distinguished Chinese indigenous pig breed that exhibits disease resistance 
and high meat quality, the Anqing six-end-white (AQ) pig represents a valuable 
germplasm resource for improving the quality of the pig breeding industry. In 
this study, 24 AQ pigs that were distantly blood-related and 6 Asian Wild Boar 
(AWB) were selected for 10× deep-genome resequencing. The signatures of the 
selection were analyzed to explore the genetic basis of their germplasm 
characteristics and to identify excellent germplasm-related functional genes 
based on NGS data. A total of 49,289,052 SNPs and 6,186,123 indels were detected 
across the genome in 30 pigs. Most of the genetic variations were synonym 
mutations and existed in the intergenic region. We identified 275 selected 
regions (top 1%) harboring 85 genes by applying a crossover approach based on 
genetic differentiation (FST) and polymorphism levels (π ratio). Some genes were 
found to be positively selected in AQ pigs' breeding. The SMPD4 and DDX18 genes 
were involved in the immune response to pseudorabies virus (PRV) and porcine 
reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The BCL6 and P2RX6 genes 
were involved in biological regulation of immune T cells and phagocytes. The 
SLC7A4 and SPACA4 genes were related to reproductive performance. The MSTN and 
HIF1A genes were related to fat deposition and muscle development. Moreover, 138 
overlapping regions were detected in selected regions and ROH islands of AQ 
pigs. Additionally, we found that the QTLs with the most overlapping regions 
were related to back fat thickness, meat color, pH value, fatty acid content, 
immune cells, parasitic immunity, and bacterial immunity. Based on functional 
enrichment analysis and QTLs mapping, we conducted further research on the 
molecular genetic basis of germplasm traits (disease resistance and excellent 
meat quality). These results are a reliable resource for conserving germplasm 
resources and exploiting molecular markers of AQ pigs."
1656,"Pulmonary neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNENs) are currently classified into four 
major histotypes, including typical carcinoid (TC), atypical carcinoid (AC), 
large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and small cell lung carcinoma 
(SCLC). This classification was designed to be applied to surgical specimens 
mostly anchored in morphological parameters, resulting in considerable 
overlapping among PNENs, which may result in important challenges for 
clinicians' decisions in the case of small biopsies. Since PNENs originate from 
the neuroectodermic cells, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene 
expression shows promise as biomarkers involved in the genotypic transformation 
of neuroectodermic cells, including mutation burden with the involvement of 
chromatin remodeling genes, apoptosis, and mitosis rate, leading to modification 
in final cellular phenotype. In this situation, additional markers also 
applicable to biopsy specimens, which correlate PNENs subtypes with systemic 
treatment response, are much needed, and current potential candidates are 
neurogenic EMT genes. This study investigated EMT genes expression and its 
association with PNENs histotypes in tumor tissues from 24 patients with PNENs. 
PCR Array System for 84 EMT-related genes selected 15 differentially expressed 
genes among the PNENs, allowing to discriminate TC from AC, LCNEC from AC, and 
SCLC from AC. Functional enrichment analysis of the EMT genes differentially 
expressed among PNENs subtypes showed that they are involved in cellular 
proliferation, extracellular matrix degradation, regulation of cell apoptosis, 
oncogenesis, and tumor cell invasion. Interestingly, four EMT genes (MAP1B, 
SNAI2, MMP2, WNT5A) are also involved in neurological diseases, in brain 
metastasis, and interact with platinum-based chemotherapy and tyrosine-kinase 
inhibitors. Collectively, these findings emerge as an important ancillary tool 
to improve the strategies of histologic diagnosis in PNENs and unveil the four 
EMT genes that can play an important role in driving chemical response in PNENs."
1657,"Our previous studies found that bta-miR-106b and its corresponding target gene, 
CDKN1A, were differentially expressed between the mammary epithelium of 
lactating Holstein cows with extremely high and low milk protein and fat 
percentage, implying the potential role of bta-miR-106b in milk composition 
synthesis. In this study, with luciferase assay experiment, bta-miR-106b was 
validated to target the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of bovine CDKN1A, thereby 
regulating its expression. Moreover, in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs), 
over-expression of bta-miR-106b significantly down-regulated the CDKN1A 
expression at both mRNA and protein levels, and inhibitors of bta-miR-106b 
increased CDKN1A expression. Of note, we observed that bta-miR-106b accelerated 
cell proliferation and cell cycle, and changed the expressions of protein 
synthesis related pathways such as JAK-STAT and PI3K/AKT/mTOR through regulating 
CDKN1A expression. Our findings highlight the important regulatory role of 
bta-miR-106b in milk protein synthesis by targeting CDKN1A in dairy cattle."
1658,"The purpose of this paper was to investigate the effects of N-acetylcysteine 
(NAC) on the proliferation, hormone secretion, and mRNA expression profiles of 
ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) in vitro. A total of 12 ovaries from 6 
follicular-stage goats were collected for granulosa cell extraction. The optimum 
concentration of NAC addition was determined to be 200 μM via the Cell Counting 
Kit 8 (CCK-8) method. Next, GCs were cultured in a medium supplemented with 200 
μM NAC (200 μM NAC group) and 0 μ M NAC (control group) for 48 h. The effects of 
200 μM NAC on the proliferation of granulosa cells and hormones were studied by 
5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA). mRNA expression was analyzed by transcriptome sequencing. The results 
indicate that 200 μM NAC significantly increased cell viability and the 
proportion of cells in the S phase but promoted hormone secretion to a lesser 
degree. Overall, 122 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. A 
total of 51 upregulated and 71 downregulated genes were included. Gene Ontology 
(GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses 
indicated that the most DEGs were enriched in terms of cell growth regulation, 
cell growth, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cytokine-cytokine receptor 
interaction, the cAMP-signaling pathway, and the Wnt-signaling pathway. Seven 
genes related to granulosa cell proliferation were screened, IGFBP4, HTRA4, SST, 
SSTR1, WISP1, DAAM2, and RSPO2. The above results provide molecular theoretical 
support for NAC as a feed additive to improve follicle development and improve 
reproductive performance in ewes."
1659,"SMAD1, SMAD2, and SMAD3 are important transcription factors downstream of the 
TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway that mediates several physiological processes. In 
the current study, we used cloning sequencing, RT-qPCR, bioinformatics methods 
and iMLDR technology to clone the coding region of Tibetan sheep genes, analyze 
the protein structure and detect the tissue expression characteristics of 
Tibetan sheep genes, and detect the polymorphisms of 433 Tibetan sheep and 
analyze their correlation with litter size. The results showed that the ORFs of 
the SMAD1, SMAD2 and SMAD3 genes were 1398 bp, 1404 bp and 1278 bp, 
respectively, and encoded 465, 467 and 425 amino acids, respectively. The SMAD1, 
SMAD2, and SMAD3 proteins were all unstable hydrophilic mixed proteins. SMAD1, 
SMAD2 and SMAD3 were widely expressed in Tibetan sheep tissues, and all were 
highly expressed in the uterus, spleen, ovary and lung tissues. Litter sizes of 
the genotype CC in the SMAD1 gene g.10729C&gt;T locus were significantly higher 
than that of CT (p &lt; 0.05). In the SMAD3 gene g.21447C&gt;T locus, the 
genotype TT individuals showed a higher litter size than the CC and CT genotype 
individuals (p &lt; 0.05). These results preliminarily demonstrated that SMAD1, 
SMAD2 and SMAD3 were the major candidate genes that affected litter size traits 
in Tibetan sheep and could be used as a molecular genetic marker for early 
auxiliary selection for improving reproductive traits during sheep breeding."
1660,"Routine diagnostics is biased towards genes and variants with satisfactory 
evidence, but rare disorders with only little confirmation of their 
pathogenicity might be missed. Many of these genes can, however, be considered 
relevant, although they may have less evidence because they lack OMIM entries or 
comprise only a small number of publicly available variants from one or a few 
studies. Here, we present 89 individuals harbouring variants in 77 genes for 
which only a small amount of public evidence on their clinical significance is 
available but which we still found to be relevant enough to be reported in 
routine diagnostics. For 21 genes, we present case reports that confirm the lack 
or provisionality of OMIM associations (ATP6V0A1, CNTN2, GABRD, NCKAP1, RHEB, 
TCF7L2), broaden the phenotypic spectrum (CC2D1A, KCTD17, YAP1) or substantially 
strengthen the confirmation of genes with limited evidence in the medical 
literature (ADARB1, AP2M1, BCKDK, BCORL1, CARS2, FBXO38, GABRB1, KAT8, PRKD1, 
RAB11B, RUSC2, ZNF142). Routine diagnostics can provide valuable information on 
disease associations and support for genes without requiring tremendous research 
efforts. Thus, our results validate and delineate gene-disorder associations 
with the aim of motivating clinicians and scientists in diagnostic departments 
to provide additional evidence via publicly available databases or by publishing 
short case reports."
1661,"The COVID-19 pandemic stemmed a parallel upsurge in the scientific literature 
about SARS-CoV-2 infection and its health burden. The Rat Genome Database (RGD) 
created a COVID-19 Disease Portal to leverage information from the scientific 
literature. In the COVID-19 Portal, gene-disease associations are established by 
manual curation of PubMed literature. The portal contains data for nine 
ontologies related to COVID-19, an embedded enrichment analysis tool, as well as 
links to a toolkit. Using these information and tools, we performed analyses on 
the curated COVID-19 disease genes. As expected, Disease Ontology enrichment 
analysis showed that the COVID-19 gene set is highly enriched with coronavirus 
infectious disease and related diseases. However, other less related diseases 
were also highly enriched, such as liver and rheumatic diseases. Using the 
comparison heatmap tool, we found nearly 60 percent of the COVID-19 genes were 
associated with nervous system disease and 40 percent were associated with 
gastrointestinal disease. Our analysis confirms the role of the immune system in 
COVID-19 pathogenesis as shown by substantial enrichment of immune system 
related Gene Ontology terms. The information in RGD's COVID-19 disease portal 
can generate new hypotheses to potentiate novel therapies and prevention of 
acute and long-term complications of COVID-19."
1662,"Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder where an oncogenic 
TP53 germline mutation is inherited by offspring of a carrier parent. p53 is a 
key tumor suppressor regulating cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. 
Unexpectedly, some mutant TP53 carriers remain unaffected, while their children 
develop cancer early in life. To begin unravelling this paradox, the response of 
dermal fibroblasts (dFb) isolated from a child with LFS was compared to those 
from her unaffected father after UV exposure. Phospho-Chk1[S345], a key 
activator of cell cycle arrest, was increased by UV induction in the LFS patient 
compared to their unaffected parent dFb. This result, along with previous 
findings of reduced CDKN1A/p21 UV induction in affected dFb, suggest that cell 
cycle dysregulation may contribute to cancer onset in the affected LFS subject 
but not the unaffected parent. Mutant p53 protein and its promoter binding 
affinity were also higher in dFb from the LFS patient compared to their 
unaffected parent. These results were as predicted based on decreased mutant 
TP53 allele-specific mRNA expression previously found in unaffected dFb. 
Investigation of the potential mechanism regulating this TP53 allele-specific 
expression found that, while epigenetic promoter methylation was not detectable, 
TP53 wild-type mRNA was specifically stabilized in the unaffected dFb. Hence, 
the allele-specific stabilization of wild-type TP53 mRNA may allow an unaffected 
parent to counteract genotoxic stress by means more characteristic of homozygous 
wild-type TP53 individuals than their affected offspring, providing protection 
from the oncogenesis associated with LFS."
1663,"Melanoma is considered to be the most serious and aggressive type of skin 
cancer, and metastasis appears to be the most important factor in its prognosis. 
Herein, we developed a transfer learning-based biomarker discovery model that 
could aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. After applying it to 
the ensemble machine learning model, results revealed that the genes found were 
consistent with those found using other methodologies previously applied to the 
same TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data set. Further novel biomarkers were also 
found. Our ensemble model achieved an AUC of 0.9861, an accuracy of 91.05, and 
an F1 score of 90.60 using an independent validation data set. This study was 
able to identify potential genes for diagnostic classification (C7 and GRIK5) 
and diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers (S100A7, S100A7, KRT14, KRT17, KRT6B, 
KRTDAP, SERPINB4, TSHR, PVRL4, WFDC5, IL20RB) in melanoma. The results show the 
utility of a transfer learning approach for biomarker discovery in melanoma."
1664,"The endothelium is a monolayer of cells lining the inner blood vessels. 
Endothelial cells (ECs) play indispensable roles in angiogenesis, homeostasis, 
and immune response under normal physiological conditions, and their dysfunction 
is closely associated with pathologies such as cardiovascular diseases. Abnormal 
EC metabolism, especially dysfunctional fatty acid (FA) metabolism, contributes 
to the development of many diseases including pulmonary hypertension (PH). In 
this review, we focus on discussing the latest advances in FA metabolism in ECs 
under normal and pathological conditions with an emphasis on PH. We also 
highlight areas of research that warrant further investigation."
1665,"Mutations in several genes involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene 
expression have been considered risk alterations to different intellectual 
disability (ID) syndromes associated with features of autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD). Among them are the pathogenic variants of the lysine-acetyltransferase 6A 
(KAT6A) gene, which causes KAT6A syndrome. The KAT6A enzyme participates in a 
wide range of critical cellular functions, such as chromatin remodeling, gene 
expression, protein synthesis, cell metabolism, and replication. In this 
manuscript, we examined the pathophysiological alterations in fibroblasts 
derived from three patients harboring KAT6A mutations. We addressed survival in 
a stress medium, histone acetylation, protein expression patterns, and 
transcriptome analysis, as well as cell bioenergetics. In addition, we evaluated 
the therapeutic effectiveness of epigenetic modulators and mitochondrial 
boosting agents, such as pantothenate and L-carnitine, in correcting the mutant 
phenotype. Pantothenate and L-carnitine treatment increased histone acetylation 
and partially corrected protein and transcriptomic expression patterns in mutant 
KAT6A cells. Furthermore, the cell bioenergetics of mutant cells was 
significantly improved. Our results suggest that pantothenate and L-carnitine 
can significantly improve the mutant phenotype in cellular models of KAT6A 
syndrome."
1666,"White mold can result in snap bean yield losses of 90 to 100% when field 
conditions favor the pathogen. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was 
conducted to detect loci significantly associated with white mold resistance in 
a panel of snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cultivars. Two populations of snap 
bean were used in this study. The first population was the BeanCAP (Coordinated 
Agriculture Project) Snap Bean Diversity Panel (SBDP) (n = 136), and the second 
population was the Snap Bean Association Panel (SnAP) (n = 378). SBDP was 
evaluated for white mold reaction in the field in 2012 and 2013, and SnAP was 
screened in a greenhouse only using the seedling straw test in 2016. Two 
reference genomes representing the Andean and Middle American centers of 
domestication were utilized to align the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data. A 
GWAS was performed using FarmCPU with one principal component after comparing 
five models. Thirty-four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly 
associated with white mold resistance were detected. Eleven significant SNPs 
were identified by the seedling straw test, and 23 significant SNPs were 
identified by field data. Fifteen SNPs were identified within a 100 kb window 
containing pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR)-encoding genes, and eleven were close 
to leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-encoding genes, suggesting that these two classes 
are of outsized importance for snap bean resistance to white mold."
1667,"Undernourishment of nutrients, also known as hidden hunger, affects over 2 
billion populace globally. Even though stunting among children below five years 
of age has decreased in India in the last ten years, India is home to roughly 
thirty percent of the world's population of stunted pre-schoolers. A significant 
improvement has been witnessed in the targeted development and deployment of 
biofortified crops; approximately 20 million farm households from developing 
counties benefit from cultivating and consuming biofortified crops. There is 
ample scope for including biofortified varieties in the seed chain, ensuring 
nutritional security. Wheat is a dietary staple in India, typically consumed as 
wholemeal flour in the form of flatbreads such as chapatti and roti. Wheat 
contributes to nearly one fifth of global energy requirements and can also 
provide better amounts of iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). As a result, biofortified 
wheat can serve as a medium for delivery of essential micronutrients such as Fe 
and Zn to end users. This review discusses wheat biofortification components 
such as Fe and Zn dynamics, its uptake and movement in plants, the genetics of 
their buildup, and the inclusion of biofortified wheat varieties in the seed 
multiplication chain concerning India."
1668,"Stuttering is a common neurodevelopment speech disorder that negatively affects 
the socio-psychological dimensions of people with disability. It displays many 
attributes of a complex genetic trait, and a few genetic loci have been 
identified through linkage studies. Stuttering is highly variable regarding its 
phenotypes and molecular etiology. However, all stutters have some common 
features, including blocks in speech, prolongation, and repetition of sounds, 
syllables, and words. The involuntary actions associated with stuttering often 
involve increased eye blinking, tremors of the lips or jaws, head jerks, 
clenched fists, perspiration, and cardiovascular changes. In the present study, 
we recruited a consanguineous Pakistani family showing an autosomal recessive 
mode of inheritance. The exome sequencing identified a homozygous splice site 
variant in ARMC3 (Armadillo Repeat Containing 3) in a consanguineous Pashtun 
family of Pakistani origin as the underlying genetic cause of non-syndromic 
stuttering. The homozygous splice site variant (NM_173081.5:c.916 + 1G &gt; A) 
segregated with the stuttering phenotype in this family. The splice change 
leading to the skipping of exon-8 is a loss of function (LoF) variant, which is 
predicted to undergo NMD (Nonsense mediated decay). Here, we report ARMC3 as a 
novel candidate gene causing the stuttering phenotype. ARMC3 may lead to 
neurodevelopmental disorders, including stuttering in humans."
1669,"β-amylase (BAM) plays an important role in plant development and response to 
abiotic stresses. In this study, 5 DoBAM members were identified in yam 
(Dioscorea opposita Thunb.). A novel β-amylase gene BAM1, (named DoBAM1), was 
isolated from yam varieties Bikeqi and Dahechangyu. The open reading frame (ORF) 
of DoBAM1 is 2806 bp and encodes 543 amino acids. Subcellular localization 
analysis indicates that DoBAM1 localizes to the cell membrane and cytoplasm. In 
the yam variety Dahechangyu, the starch content, β-amylase activity, and 
expression of DoBAM1 were characterized and found to all be higher than in 
Bikeqi. DoBAM1 overexpression in tobacco is shown to promote the accumulation of 
soluble sugar and chlorophyll content and to increase the activities of 
peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and β-amylase. 
Under cold treatment, we observed the induced upregulation of DoBAM1 and lower 
starch content and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation than in WT plants. In 
conclusion, these results demonstrate that DoBAM1 overexpression plays an 
advanced role in cold tolerance, at least in part by raising the levels of 
soluble sugars that are capable of acting as osmolytes or antioxidants."
1670,"Dysregulation of amino acid metabolism (AAM) is an important factor in cancer 
progression. This study intended to study the prognostic value of AAM-related 
genes in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Methods: The mRNA expression profiles of 
LUAD datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) were applied as the training and validation sets. After identifying the 
differentially expressed AAM-related genes, an AAM-related gene signature 
(AAMRGS) was constructed and validated. Additionally, we systematically analyzed 
the differences in immune cell infiltration, biological pathways, immunotherapy 
response, and drug sensitivity between the two AAMRGS subgroups. Results: The 
prognosis-related signature was constructed on the grounds of key AAM-related 
genes. LUAD patients were divided into AAMRGS-high and -low groups. Patients in 
the two subgroups differed in prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME), 
biological pathways, and sensitivity to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and calibration curves showed 
good predictive ability for the nomogram. Analysis of immune cell infiltration 
revealed that the TME of the AAMRGS-low group was in a state of immune 
activation. Conclusion: We constructed an AAMRGS that could effectively predict 
prognosis and guide treatment strategies for patients with LUAD."
1671,"Taro (Colocasia esculenta L. Schott, Araceae), an ancient root and tuber crop, 
is highly polygenic, polyphyletic, and polygeographic in nature, which leads to 
its rapid genetic erosion. To prevent the perceived loss of taro diversity, 
species discrimination and genetic conservation of promising taro genotypes need 
special attention. Reports on genetic discrimination of taro at its center of 
origin are still untapped. We performed DNA barcoding of twenty promising 
genotypes of taro indigenous to the northeastern hill region of India, deploying 
two chloroplast-plastid genes, matK and rbcL, and the ribosomal nuclear gene 
ITS2. The secondary structure of ITS2 was determined and molecular phylogeny was 
performed to assess genetic discrimination among the taro genotypes. The matK 
and rbcL genes were highly efficient (&gt;90%) in amplification and sequencing. 
However, the ITS2 barcode region achieved significant discrimination among the 
tested taro genotypes. All the taro genotypes displayed most similar sequences 
at the conserved matK and rbcL loci. However, distinct sequence lengths were 
observed in the ITS2 barcode region, revealing accurate discriminations among 
the genotypes. Multiple barcode markers are unrelated to one another and change 
independently, providing different estimations of heritable traits and genetic 
lineages; thus, they are advantageous over a single locus in genetic 
discrimination studies. A dynamic programming algorithm that used base-pairing 
interactions within a single nucleic acid polymer or between two polymers 
transformed the secondary structures into the symbol code data to predict seven 
different minimum free energy secondary structures. Our analysis strengthens the 
potential of the ITS2 gene as a potent DNA barcode candidate in the prediction 
of a valuable secondary structure that would help in genetic discrimination 
between the genotypes while augmenting future breeding strategies in taro."
1672,"Plant transcription factors are involved in different developmental pathways. 
NAC transcription factors (No Apical Meristem, Arabidopsis thaliana Activating 
Factor, Cup-shaped Cotyledon) act in various processes, e.g., plant organ 
formation, response to stress, and defense mechanisms. In Antirrhinum majus, the 
NAC transcription factor CUPULIFORMIS (CUP) plays a role in determining organ 
boundaries and lip formation, and the CUP homologs of Arabidopsis and Petunia 
are involved in flower organ formation. Orchidaceae is one of the most 
species-rich families of angiosperms, known for its extraordinary 
diversification of flower morphology. We conducted a transcriptome and 
genome-wide analysis of orchid NACs, focusing on the No Apical Meristem (NAM) 
subfamily and CUP genes. To check whether the CUP homologs could be involved in 
the perianth formation of orchids, we performed an expression analysis on the 
flower organs of the orchid Phalaenopsis aphrodite at different developmental 
stages. The expression patterns of the CUP genes of P. aphrodite suggest their 
possible role in flower development and symmetry establishment. In addition, as 
observed in other species, the orchid CUP1 and CUP2 genes seem to be regulated 
by the microRNA, miR164. Our results represent a preliminary study of NAC 
transcription factors in orchids to understand the role of these genes during 
orchid flower formation."
1673,"The most common cardiovascular disease in domestic dogs is myxomatous mitral 
valve disease (MMVD), accounting for 75% of all cardiac disease. An increase in 
age is generally associated with increased incidence of the disease, but 
Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) exhibit an unusually high prevalence of 
early-onset MMVD, and thus, potentially greater cardiac morbidity and mortality 
compared to other breeds. Previous research has suggested that selected 
candidate risk alleles for MMVD are fixed in CKCSs, including six locations 
within the Nebulette (NEBL) gene on CFA2. The current study analysed genotypes 
of 180 Australian CKCSs at the identified risk loci. Of these, 178 were 
phenotyped for severity of disease by echocardiographic measurements of left 
atrium to aortic root ratio (LA:Ao) and weight normalised left ventricular end 
diastolic diameter (LVIDdN). Genotyping array markers correctly predicted the 
genotype at the risk-variant loci in the CKCS population, and the NEBL1, NEBL2 
and NEBL3 variants were observed to be in perfect linkage disequilibrium in this 
cohort. The CKCS cohort included 6/178 dogs being heterozygous for the 
protective/wild-type alleles at the NEBL locus. The mean LA:Ao and LVIDdN scores 
of these dogs heterozygous at NEBL1-3 variants were significantly smaller, and 
with significantly lower variance compared to age-matched CKCSs that were 
homozygous for risk alleles. The lower cardiac measurements in the heterozygous 
dogs indicate a significantly reduced risk of severe MMVD disease. Our analysis 
suggests that despite relative fixation of the NEBL risk alleles, healthy 
reference alleles at NEBL1-3 exist in low frequency in the CKCS breed and can be 
used to reduce MMVD severity and mortality."
1674,"Physalis angulata var. villosa, rich in withanolides, has been used as a 
traditional Chinese medicine for many years. To date, few extensive molecular 
studies of this plant have been conducted. In the present study, the plastome of 
P. angulata var. villosa was sequenced, characterized and compared with that of 
other Physalis species, and a phylogenetic analysis was conducted in the family 
Solanaceae. The plastome of P. angulata var. villosa was 156,898 bp in length 
with a GC content of 37.52%, and exhibited a quadripartite structure typical of 
land plants, consisting of a large single-copy (LSC, 87,108 bp) region, a small 
single-copy (SSC, 18,462 bp) region and a pair of inverted repeats (IR: IRA and 
IRB, 25,664 bp each). The plastome contained 131 genes, of which 114 were unique 
and 17 were duplicated in IR regions. The genome consisted of 85 protein-coding 
genes, eight rRNA genes and 38 tRNA genes. A total of 38 long, repeat sequences 
of three types were identified in the plastome, of which forward repeats had the 
highest frequency. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) analysis revealed a total of 
57 SSRs, of which the T mononucleotide constituted the majority, with most of 
SSRs being located in the intergenic spacer regions. Comparative genomic 
analysis among nine Physalis species revealed that the single-copy regions were 
less conserved than the pair of inverted repeats, with most of the variation 
being found in the intergenic spacer regions rather than in the coding regions. 
Phylogenetic analysis indicated a close relationship between Physalis and 
Withania. In addition, Iochroma, Dunalia, Saracha and Eriolarynx were 
paraphyletic, and clustered together in the phylogenetic tree. Our study 
published the first sequence and assembly of the plastome of P. angulata var. 
villosa, reported its basic resources for evolutionary studies and provided an 
important tool for evaluating the phylogenetic relationship within the family 
Solanaceae."
1675,"The bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain JP233 has been reported to efficiently 
solubilize sparingly soluble inorganic phosphate, promote plant growth and 
significantly reduce phosphorus (P) leaching loss from soil. The production of 
2-keto gluconic acid (2KGA) by strain JP233 was identified as the main active 
metabolite responsible for phosphate solubilization. However, the genetic basis 
of phosphate solubilization and plant-growth promotion remained unclear. As a 
result, the genome of JP233 was sequenced and analyzed in this study. The JP233 
genome consists of a circular chromosome with a size of 5,617,746 bp and a GC 
content of 62.86%. No plasmids were detected in the genome. There were 5097 
protein-coding sequences (CDSs) predicted in the genome. Phylogenetic analyses 
based on genomes of related Pseudomonas spp. identified strain JP233 as 
Pseudomonas asiatica. Comparative pangenomic analysis among 9 P. asiatica 
strains identified 4080 core gene clusters and 111 singleton genes present only 
in JP233. Genes associated with 2KGA production detected in strain JP233, 
included those encoding glucose dehydrogenase, pyrroloquinoline quinone and 
gluoconate dehydrogenase. Genes associated with mechanisms of plant-growth 
promotion and nutrient acquisition detected in JP233 included those involved in 
IAA biosynthesis, ethylene catabolism and siderophore production. Numerous genes 
associated with other properties beneficial to plant growth were also detected 
in JP233, included those involved in production of acetoin, 2,3-butanediol, 
trehalose, and resistance to heavy metals. This study provides the genetic basis 
to elucidate the plant-growth promoting and bio-remediation properties of strain 
JP233 and its potential applications in agriculture and industry."
1676,"Information on the general combining ability of inbred lines and the specific 
combining ability of hybrid combinations is crucial for successful hybrid 
development. The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the combining 
ability of thirty selected early maturing maize inbred lines under 
Striga-infested and optimal environments, (ii) classify the inbred lines into 
heterotic groups using the general combining ability effects of multiple traits 
(HGCAMT) and the single nucleotide polymorphism genetic distance (SNP- GD) 
methods, and (iii) assess the effectiveness of the heterotic grouping methods. 
One hundred and fifty single-cross hybrids were generated from the thirty inbred 
lines using the North Carolina Design II mating method. The hybrids and six 
local check varieties were tested across optimal and Striga-infested 
environments in Ghana and Nigeria in 2016 and 2017. The inheritance of grain 
yield was controlled by the non-additive gene action under both environments and 
the additive gene action across the two research environments. The non-additive 
gene action modulated the inheritance of measured traits under Striga-infested 
environments, except for the Striga damage syndrome rating at 8 weeks after 
planting. Maternal effects were observed for most traits in each environment and 
across environments. The inbred lines TZEI 127 and TZEI 40 exhibited significant 
and positive GCA male and female effects for grain yield under each environment 
and across the two research environments, indicating the presence of favorable 
alleles for yield improvements. The SNP-GD heterotic grouping method was 
identified as the most adequate in grouping the thirty inbred lines."
1677,"Human orthopneumovirus (HOPV) is the major viral pathogen responsible for lower 
respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants and young children in Riyadh, 
Saudi Arabia. Yet, predominant HOPV subtypes circulating in this region and 
their molecular and epidemiological characteristics are not fully ascertained. A 
total of 300 clinical samples involving nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), throat 
swabs, and sputum were collected during winter seasons of 2019/2020 and 
2021/2022 for HOPV subtyping and genotyping. Of the 300 samples, HOPV was 
identified in 55 samples (18.3%) with a distinct predominance of type A viruses 
(81.8%) compared to type B viruses (18.2%). Importantly, the ON1 strain of 
HOPV-A and BA-IX strain of HOPV-B groups were found to be responsible for all 
the infections. Sequence analysis revealed a duplication region within 2nd HVR 
of G protein gene of ON1 and BA-IX strains. This nucleotide duplication exerted 
a profound effect on protein length and affinity towards cell receptors. 
Further, these modifications may aid the HOPV in immune evasion and recurrent 
infections. Data from this study showed that ON-1 genotype of HOPV-A and BA-IX 
genotype of HOPV-B were dominant in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Further, a duplication 
of sequence within 2nd HVR of G protein gene was found."
1678,"Gene immunization comprises mRNA and DNA vaccines, which stand out due to their 
simple design, maintenance, and high efficacy. Several studies indicate 
promising results in preclinical and clinical trials regarding immunization 
against ebola, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, and human 
papillomavirus (HPV). The efficiency of nucleic acid vaccines has been 
highlighted in the fight against COVID-19 with unprecedented approval of their 
use in humans. However, their low intrinsic immunogenicity points to the need to 
use strategies capable of overcoming this characteristic and increasing the 
efficiency of vaccine campaigns. These strategies include the improvement of the 
epitopes' presentation to the system via MHC, the evaluation of immunodominant 
epitopes with high coverage against emerging viral subtypes, the use of 
adjuvants that enhance immunogenicity, and the increase in the efficiency of 
vaccine transfection. In this review, we provide updates regarding some 
characteristics, construction, and improvement of such vaccines, especially 
about the production of synthetic multi-epitope genes, widely employed in the 
current gene-based vaccines."
1679,"Simulation experiments are essential to evaluate epistasis detection methods, 
which is the main way to prove their effectiveness and move toward practical 
applications. However, due to the lack of effective simulators, especially for 
simulating models without marginal effects (eNME models), epistasis detection 
methods can hardly verify their effectiveness through simulation experiments. In 
this study, we propose a resampling simulation method (EpiReSIM) for generating 
the eNME model. First, EpiReSIM provides two strategies for solving eNME models. 
One is to calculate eNME models using prevalence constraints, and another is by 
joint constraints of prevalence and heritability. We transform the computation 
of the model into the problem of solving the under-determined system of 
equations. Introducing the complete orthogonal decomposition method and Newton's 
method, EpiReSIM calculates the solution of the underdetermined system of 
equations to obtain the eNME model, especially the solution of the high-order 
model, which is the highlight of EpiReSIM. Second, based on the computed eNME 
model, EpiReSIM generates simulation data by a resampling method. Experimental 
results show that EpiReSIM has advantages in preserving the biological 
properties of minor allele frequencies and calculating high-order models, and it 
is a convenient and effective alternative method for current simulation 
software."
1680,"Macrocephaly frequently occurs in single-gene disorders affecting the 
PI3K-AKT-MTOR pathway; however, epigenetic mutations, mosaicism, and copy number 
variations (CNVs) are emerging relevant causative factors, revealing a higher 
genetic heterogeneity than previously expected. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the role of rare CNVs in patients with macrocephaly and review 
genomic loci and known genes. We retrieved from the DECIPHER database de novo 
&lt;500 kb CNVs reported on patients with macrocephaly; in four cases, a 
candidate gene for macrocephaly could be pinpointed: a known microcephaly 
gene-TRAPPC9, and three genes based on their functional roles-RALGAPB, RBMS3, 
and ZDHHC14. From the literature review, 28 pathogenic CNV genomic loci and over 
300 known genes linked to macrocephaly were gathered. Among the genomic regions, 
17 CNV loci (~61%) exhibited mirror phenotypes, that is, deletions and 
duplications having opposite effects on head size. Identifying structural 
variants affecting head size can be a preeminent source of information about 
pathways underlying brain development. In this study, we reviewed these genes 
and recurrent CNV loci associated with macrocephaly, as well as suggested novel 
potential candidate genes deserving further studies to endorse their involvement 
with this phenotype."
1681,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification is the most prevalent type of RNA 
methylation and plays a pivotal role in the development of plants. However, 
knowledge of the m6A modification in litchi remains limited. In this study, a 
complete analysis of m6A writers, erasers, and readers in litchi was performed 
and 31 litchi m6A regulatory genes were identified in total, including 7 m6A 
writers, 12 m6A erases, and 12 readers. Phylogeny analysis showed that all three 
of the kinds of litchi m6A regulatory proteins could be divided into three 
groups; domains and motifs exhibited similar patterns in the same group. MiRNA 
target site prediction showed that 77 miRNA target sites were located in 25 
(80.6%) litchi m6A regulatory genes. Cis-elements analysis exhibited that litchi 
m6A regulatory genes were mainly responsive to light and plant hormones, 
followed by environmental stress and plant development. Expression analysis 
revealed litchi m6A regulatory genes might play an important role during the 
peel coloration and fruit abscission of litchi. This study provided valuable and 
expectable information of litchi m6A regulatory genes and their potential 
epigenetic regulation mechanism in litchi."
1682,"Oxidized in vitro genomic DNA (gDNA) is known to launch an adaptive response in 
human cell cultures. The cfDNA extracted from the plasma of schizophrenic 
patients (sz-cfDNA) and healthy controls (hc-cfDNA) contains increased amounts 
of 8-oxodG, a DNA-oxidation marker. The aim of the research was answering a 
question: can the human cfDNA isolated from blood plasma stimulate the adaptive 
response in human cells? In vitro responses of ten human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) 
and four peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) lines after 1-24 h of 
incubation with sz-cfDNA, gDNA and hc-cfDNA containing different amounts of 
8-oxodG were examined. Expressions of RNA of eight genes (NOX4, NFE2L2, SOD1, 
HIF1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, BAX and BCL2), six proteins (NOX4, NRF2, SOD1, HIF1A, γH2AX 
and BRCA1) and DNA-oxidation marker 8-oxodG were analyzed by RT-qPCR and flow 
cytometry (when analyzing the data, a subpopulation of lymphocytes (PBL) was 
identified). Adding hc-cfDNA or sz-cfDNA to HSFs or PBMC media in equal amounts 
(50 ng/mL, 1-3 h) stimulated transient synthesis of free radicals (ROS), which 
correlated with an increase in the expressions of NOX4 and SOD1 genes and with 
an increase in the levels of the markers of DNA damage γH2AX and 8-oxodG. ROS 
and DNA damage induced an antioxidant response (expression of NFE2L2 and HIF1A), 
DNA damage response (BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene expression) and anti-apoptotic 
response (changes in BAX and BCL2 genes expression). Heterogeneity of cells of 
the same HSFs or PBL population was found with respect to the type of response 
to (sz,hc)-cfDNA. Most cells responded to oxidative stress with an increase in 
the amount of NRF2 and BRCA1 proteins along with a moderate increase in the 
amount of NOX4 protein and a low amount of 8-oxodG oxidation marker. However, 
upon the exposure to (sz,hc)-cfDNA, the size of the subpopulation with apoptosis 
signs (high DNA damage degree, high NOX4 and low NRF2 and BRCA1 levels) also 
increased. No significant difference between the responses to sz-cfDNA and 
hc-cfDNA was observed. Sz-cfDNA and hc-cfDNA showed similarly high bioactivity 
towards fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Conclusion: In cultured human cells, 
hc-cfDNA and sz-cfDNA equally stimulated an adaptive response aimed at launching 
the antioxidant, repair, and anti-apoptotic processes. The mediator of the 
development of the adaptive response are ROS produced by, among others, NOX4 and 
SOD1 enzymes."
1683,"Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed necrotic cell death, but its 
potential prognostic value in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. On 
the basis of available AML data from TCGA and TARGET databases, a 10-gene 
signature model was constructed to effectively predict AML prognosis by 
performing LASSO Cox regression analysis, which showed that patients with a 
low-risk score had a significantly better prognosis than that of the high-risk 
group, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis achieved superior 
performance in the prognostic model. The model was further well-verified in an 
external GEO cohort. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that, in 
addition to age, the risk score was an independent poor survival factor for AML 
patients, and a nomogram model was constructed with high accuracy. Moreover, the 
high-risk group generally had higher cytolytic activity and increased levels of 
infiltrating immune cells, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and 
regulatory T cells (Tregs), which could be related to the expression of immune 
checkpoint genes. Additionally, low-risk AML patients may have a better response 
from traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. In conclusion, a pyroptosis-related 
gene signature can independently predict the prognosis of AML patients with 
sufficient predictive power, and pyroptosis plays an important role in the 
immune microenvironment of AML, which may be used to develop a new effective 
therapeutic method for AML in the future."
1684,"While genomic selection (GS) began revolutionizing plant breeding when it was 
proposed around 20 years ago, its practical implementation is still challenging 
as many factors affect its accuracy. One such factor is the choice of the 
statistical machine learning method. For this reason, we explore the tuning 
process under a multi-trait framework using the Gaussian kernel with a 
multi-trait Bayesian Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (GBLUP) model. We explored 
three methods of tuning (manual, grid search and Bayesian optimization) using 5 
real datasets of breeding programs. We found that using grid search and Bayesian 
optimization improve between 1.9 and 6.8% the prediction accuracy regarding of 
using manual tuning. While the improvement in prediction accuracy in some cases 
can be marginal, it is very important to carry out the tuning process carefully 
to improve the accuracy of the GS methodology, even though this entails greater 
computational resources."
1685,"Genomic prediction is revolutionizing plant breeding since candidate genotypes 
can be selected without the need to measure their trait in the field. When a 
reference population contains both phenotypic and genotypic information, it is 
trained by a statistical machine learning method that is subsequently used for 
making predictions of breeding or phenotypic values of candidate genotypes that 
were only genotyped. Nevertheless, the successful implementation of the genomic 
selection (GS) methodology depends on many factors. One key factor is the type 
of statistical machine learning method used since some are unable to capture 
nonlinear patterns available in the data. While kernel methods are powerful 
statistical machine learning algorithms that capture complex nonlinear patterns 
in the data, their successful implementation strongly depends on the careful 
tuning process of the involved hyperparameters. As such, in this paper we 
compare three methods of tuning (manual tuning, grid search, and Bayesian 
optimization) for the Gaussian kernel under a Bayesian best linear unbiased 
predictor model. We used six real datasets of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to 
compare the three strategies of tuning. We found that if we want to obtain the 
major benefits of using Gaussian kernels, it is very important to perform a 
careful tuning process. The best prediction performance was observed when the 
tuning process was performed with grid search and Bayesian optimization. 
However, we did not observe relevant differences between the grid search and 
Bayesian optimization approach. The observed gains in terms of prediction 
performance were between 2.1% and 27.8% across the six datasets under study."
1686,"The study of microorganisms is a field of great interest due to their 
environmental (e.g., soil contamination) and biomedical (e.g., parasitic 
diseases, autism) importance. The advent of revolutionary next-generation 
sequencing techniques, and their application to the hypervariable regions of the 
16S, 18S or 23S ribosomal subunits, have allowed the research of a large variety 
of organisms more in-depth, including bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and fungi. 
Additionally, together with the development of analysis software, the creation 
of specific databases (e.g., SILVA or RDP) has boosted the enormous growth of 
these studies. As the cost of sequencing per sample has continuously decreased, 
new protocols have also emerged, such as shotgun sequencing, which allows the 
profiling of all taxonomic domains in a sample. The sequencing of hypervariable 
regions and shotgun sequencing are technologies that enable the taxonomic 
classification of microorganisms from the DNA present in microbial communities. 
However, they are not capable of measuring what is actively expressed. 
Conversely, we advocate that metatranscriptomics is a ""new"" technology that 
makes the identification of the mRNAs of a microbial community possible, 
quantifying gene expression levels and active biological pathways. Furthermore, 
it can be also used to characterise symbiotic interactions between the host and 
its microbiome. In this manuscript, we examine the three technologies above, and 
discuss the implementation of different software and databases, which greatly 
impact the obtaining of reliable results. Finally, we have developed two 
easy-to-use pipelines leveraging Nextflow technology. These aim to provide 
everything required for an average user to perform a metagenomic analysis of 
marker genes with QIMME2 and a metatranscriptomic study using Kraken2/Bracken."
1687,"Floral syndromes are known by the conserved morphological traits in flowers 
associated with pollinator attraction, such as corolla shape and color, aroma 
emission and composition, and rewards, especially the nectar volume and sugar 
concentration. Here, we employed a phylogenetic approach to investigate 
sequences of genes enrolled in the biosynthetic pathways responsible for some 
phenotypes that are attractive to pollinators in Solanaceae genomes. We included 
genes involved in visible color, UV-light response, scent emission, and nectar 
production to test the hypothesis that these essential genes have evolved by 
convergence under pollinator selection. Our results refuted this hypothesis as 
all four studied genes recovered the species' phylogenetic relationships, even 
though some sites were positively selected. We found differences in protein 
motifs among genera in Solanaceae that were not necessarily associated with the 
same floral syndrome. Although it has had a crucial role in plant 
diversification, the plant-pollinator interaction is complex and still needs 
further investigation, with genes evolving not only under the influence of 
pollinators, but by the sum of several evolutionary forces along the speciation 
process in Solanaceae."
1688,"(1) Background: tumor profiling enables patient survival prediction. The two 
essential parameters to be calibrated when designing a study based on tumor 
profiles from a cohort are the sequencing depth of RNA-seq technology and the 
number of patients. This calibration is carried out under cost constraints, and 
a compromise has to be found. In the context of survival data, the goal of this 
work is to benchmark the impact of the number of patients and of the sequencing 
depth of miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq on the predictive capabilities for both the Cox 
model with elastic net penalty and random survival forest. (2) Results: we first 
show that the Cox model and random survival forest provide comparable prediction 
capabilities, with significant differences for some cancers. Second, we 
demonstrate that miRNA and/or mRNA data improve prediction over clinical data 
alone. mRNA-seq data leads to slightly better prediction than miRNA-seq, with 
the notable exception of lung adenocarcinoma for which the tumor miRNA profile 
shows higher predictive power. Third, we demonstrate that the sequencing depth 
of RNA-seq data can be reduced for most of the investigated cancers without 
degrading the prediction abilities, allowing the creation of independent 
validation sets at a lower cost. Finally, we show that the number of patients in 
the training dataset can be reduced for the Cox model and random survival 
forest, allowing the use of different models on different patient subgroups."
1689,"Studies suggest that ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1 C69T) 
polymorphism is associated with a decreased incidence of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) and that there is an association between ABCA1 C69T polymorphism 
and the risk of dyslipidemia in diabetic individuals. However, other studies 
contradict these suggestions. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the prevalence 
of ABCA1 C69T (rs1800977) gene polymorphism in a representative sample of the 
Saudi population not previously diagnosed with diabetes and its possible 
association with dyslipidemia and dysglycemia. A cross-sectional design was used 
to recruit nondiabetic adults of both genders from the Saudi population in 
Jeddah by employing a stratified, two-stage cluster sampling method. A total of 
650 people (337 men and 313 women) were recruited. Demographic, dietary, and 
lifestyle variables, as well as medical history and family history of chronic 
diseases, were collected using a predesigned questionnaire. Fasting blood 
samples were taken for the determination of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and lipids profile, which were followed by a 1-h 
oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Real-time PCR technology was used to 
determine the ABCA1 C69T gene SNP (rs1800977). The T allele of ABCA1 C69T 
(rs1800977) was very frequent (TT in 44.9% and CT in 43.7%). There was a trend 
toward significance for a higher dysglycemia percentage in people with CT and TT 
genotypes (25.7%, and 23.3%, respectively) compared with CC genotypes (16.2%). 
In addition, FPG and 1-h plasma glucose were significantly higher in people with 
both TT and CT genotypes compared to CC genotypes. However, T allele was not 
associated with any dysregulation of lipid parameters."
1690,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the main cause of mortality among 
gynecological malignancies worldwide. Although patients with EOC undergo 
aggregate treatment, the prognosis is often poor. Peritoneal malignant ascites 
is a distinguishable clinical feature in EOC patients and plays a pivotal role 
in tumor progression and recurrence. The mechanisms of the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) in ascites in the regulation of tumor progression need to 
be explored. We comprehensively analyzed the transcriptomes of 4680 single cells 
from five EOC patients (three diagnostic samples and two recurrent samples) 
derived from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Batch effects between 
different samples were removed using an unsupervised deep embedding single-cell 
cluster algorithm. Subcluster analysis identified the different phenotypes of 
cells. The transition of a malignant cell state was confirmed using pseudotime 
analysis. The landscape of TME in malignant ascites was profiled during EOC 
progression. The transformation of epithelial cancer cells into mesenchymal 
cells was observed to lead to the emergence of related anti-chemotherapy and 
immune escape phenotypes. We found the activation of multiple biological 
pathways with the transition of tumor-associated macrophages and fibroblasts, 
and we identified the infiltration of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells in recurrent 
samples. The cell adhesion molecules mediated by integrin might be associated 
with the formation of the tumorsphere. Our study provides novel insights into 
the remodeling of the TME heterogeneity in malignant ascites during EOC 
progression, which provides evidence for identifying novel therapeutic targets 
and promotes the development of ovarian cancer treatment."
1691,"Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit, affecting 466 million people 
worldwide. The vast and diverse genes involved reflect the complexity of 
auditory physiology, which requires the use of animal models in order to gain a 
fuller understanding. Among the loci with a yet-to-be validated gene is the 
DFNA58, in which ~200 Kb genomic duplication, including three protein-coding 
genes (PLEK, CNRIP1, and PPP3R1's exon1), was found to segregate with autosomal 
dominant hearing loss. Through whole genome sequencing, the duplication was 
found to be in tandem and inserted in an intergenic region, without the 
disruption of the topological domains. Reanalysis of transcriptomes data studies 
(zebrafish and mouse), and RT-qPCR analysis of adult zebrafish target organs, in 
order to access their orthologues expression, highlighted promising results with 
Cnrip1a, corroborated by zebrafish in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. 
Mouse data also suggested Cnrip1 as the best candidate for a relevant role in 
auditory physiology, and its importance in hearing seems to have remained 
conserved but the cell type exerting its function might have changed, from hair 
cells to spiral ganglion neurons."
1692,"In the context of diminishing global biodiversity, the validity and practicality 
of species delimitation methods for the identification of many neglected and 
undescribed biodiverse species have been paid increasing attention. DNA 
sequence-based species delimitation methods are mainly classified into two 
categories, namely, distance-based and tree-based methods, and have been widely 
adopted in many studies. In the present study, we performed three distance-based 
(ad hoc threshold, ABGD, and ASAP) and four tree-based (sGMYC, mGMYC, PTP, and 
mPTP) analyses based on Trochoidea COI data and analyzed the discordance between 
them. Moreover, we also observed the performance of these methods at different 
taxonomic ranks (the genus, subfamily, and family ranks). The results suggested 
that the distance-based approach is generally superior to the tree-based 
approach, with the ASAP method being the most efficient. In terms of 
phylogenetic methods, the single threshold version performed better than the 
multiple threshold version of GMYC, and PTP showed higher efficiency than mPTP 
in delimiting species. Additionally, GMYC was found to be significantly 
influenced by taxonomic rank, showing poorer efficiency in datasets at the genus 
level than at higher levels. Finally, our results highlighted that cryptic 
diversity within Trochoidea (Mollusca: Vetigastropoda) might be underestimated, 
which provides quantitative evidence for excavating the cryptic lineages of 
these species."
1693,"The present equine genetic variation mirrors the deep influence of intensive 
breeding programs during the last 200 years. Here, we provide a comprehensive 
current state of knowledge on the trends and prospects on the variation in the 
equine male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY), which was assembled for 
the first time in 2018. In comparison with the other 12 mammalian species, 
horses are now the most represented, with 56 documented MSY genes. However, in 
contrast to the high variability in mitochondrial DNA observed in many horse 
breeds from different geographic areas, modern horse populations demonstrate 
extremely low genetic Y-chromosome diversity. The selective pressures employed 
by breeders using pedigree data (which are not always error-free) as a 
predictive tool represent the main cause of this lack of variation in the 
Y-chromosome. Nevertheless, the detailed phylogenies obtained by recent 
fine-scaled Y-chromosomal genotyping in many horse breeds worldwide have 
contributed to addressing the genealogical, forensic, and population questions 
leading to the reappraisal of the Y-chromosome as a powerful genetic marker to 
avoid the loss of biodiversity as a result of selective breeding practices, and 
to better understand the historical development of horse breeds."
1694,"The immune system plays a critical role in bone homeostasis and, consequently, 
in the pathophysiology of postmenopausal osteoporosis (OP) since estrogen 
deficiency induces the inflammasome and increases production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18. NLRP3 inflammasome complex genes have been 
related with bone homeostasis in cellular and animal models. Here, we performed 
an association study evaluating SNVs (single-nucleotide variants) in 
inflammasome NLRP3 pathway genes (NLRP3, CARD8, CASP1, IL-18, and IL-1β) to 
assess whether variants in these genes could be related to susceptibility to 
primary OP in postmenopausal women.
METHODS: We genotyped 196 postmenopausal OP patients and 103 healthy controls 
using SNV-specific Taqman® probes. Data and statistical analyses were performed 
using the SNPstats and GraphPad Prism 8 software.
RESULTS: We showed an association between NLRP3 rs35829419 CA genotype and lower 
bone mineral density (BMD) mean at the lumbar spine (p = 0.001); we also 
observed an association between IL-1β rs16944 AA genotype and higher BMD mean at 
the total hip (p = 0.009). The IL-1β rs16944 GG was associated with lower 
alkaline phosphatase levels (ALP) (p = 0.009), and the IL-18 rs1946519 AA was 
associated with lower vitamin D levels (p = 0.018). Additionally, OP patients 
presented deficient vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH).
CONCLUSIONS: The NLRP3 inflammasome complex SNVs were associated with OP 
severity, possibly indicating these genes' participation in bone metabolism and 
its dysregulation."
1695,"Based on previous observational studies, the causal association between 
circulating adiponectin (CA) levels and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) risk remains 
unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether CA levels are related 
to the risk of AS. We carried out a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian 
randomization (MR) analysis to examine the causal correlation between CA levels 
and AS via published genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets. 
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to CA levels were derived from a 
large GWAS that included 39,883 individuals of European descent. SNPs related to 
AS were obtained from the FinnGen consortium (2252 cases and 227,338 controls). 
The random-effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was the primary method 
utilized in our research. We also used four complementary approaches to improve 
the dependability of this study (MR-Egger regression, Weighted median, Weighted 
mode, and Simple mode). Random-effects IVW (odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.79-1.27, p = 0.984) and four complementary methods 
all indicated that genetically predicted CA levels were not causally related to 
the risk of AS. In reverse MR analysis, there is little evidence to support the 
genetic causality between the risk of AS and CA levels."
1696,"Agnathia-otocephaly complex (AOC) is a rare and usually lethal malformation 
typically characterized by hypoplasia or the absence of the mandible, 
ventromedial and caudal displacement of the ears with or without the fusion of 
the ears, a small oral aperture with or without a tongue hypoplasia. Its 
incidence is reported as 1 in 70,000 births and its etiology has been attributed 
to both genetic and teratogenic causes. AOC is characterized by a wide severity 
clinical spectrum even when occurring within the same family, ranging from a 
mild mandibular defect to an extreme facial aberration incompatible with life. 
Most AOC cases are due to a de novo sporadic mutation. Given the genetic 
heterogeneity, many genes have been reported to be implicated in this disease 
but to date, the link to only two genes has been confirmed in the development of 
this complex: the orthodenticle homeobox 2 (OTX2) gene and the paired related 
homeobox 1 (PRRX1) gene. In this article, we report a case of a fetus with 
severe AOC, diagnosed in routine ultrasound scan in the first trimester of 
pregnancy. The genetic analysis showed a novel 10 bp deletion mutation 
c.766_775delTTGGGTTTTA in the OTX2 gene, which has never been reported before, 
together with a missense variant c.778T&gt;C in cis conformation."
1697,"Small nucleolar RNA host genes (SNHGs), members of long-chain noncoding RNAs 
(lncRNAs), have received increasing attention regarding their roles in multiple 
bone diseases. Studies have revealed that SNHGs display unique expression 
profile during osteoblast differentiation and that they could act as promising 
biomarkers of certain bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. Osteogenesis of 
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is an important part of bone repair and 
reconstruction. Moreover, studies confirmed that the SNHG family participate in 
the regulation of osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in part by regulating 
important pathways of osteogenesis, such as Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Based on 
these observations, clarifying the SNHG family's roles in osteogenesis 
(especially in MSCs) and their related mechanisms would provide novel ideas for 
possible applications of lncRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of bone 
diseases. After searching, screening, browsing and intensive reading, we 
uncovered more than 30 papers related to the SNHG family and osteoblast 
differentiation that were published in recent years. Here, our review aims to 
summarize these findings in order to provide a theoretical basis for further 
research."
1698,"The loss of function melanocortin 4-receptor (MC4R) Ile269Asn mutation has been 
proposed as one of the most important genetic contributors to obesity in the 
Mexican population. However, whether patients bearing this mutation respond 
differently to weight loss treatments is unknown. We tested the association of 
this mutation with obesity in 1683 Mexican adults, and compared the response of 
mutation carriers and non-carriers to three different weight loss interventions: 
dietary restriction intervention, phentermine 30 mg/day treatment, and Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. The Ile269Asn mutation was associated with 
obesity [OR = 3.8, 95% CI (1.5-9.7), p = 0.005]. Regarding interventions, in the 
dietary restriction group only two patients were MC4R Ile269Asn mutation 
carriers. After 1 month of treatment, both mutation carriers lost weight: -4.0 
kg (-2.9%) in patient 1, and -1.8 kg (-1.5%) in patient 2; similar to the mean 
weight loss observed in six non-carrier subjects (-2.9 kg; -2.8%). Phentermine 
treatment produced similar weight loss in six carriers (-12.7 kg; 15.5%) and 18 
non-carriers (-11.3 kg; 13.6%) after 6 months of pharmacological treatment. RYGB 
also caused similar weight loss in seven carriers (29.9%) and 24 non-carriers 
(27.8%), 6 months after surgery. Our findings suggest that while the presence of 
a single MC4R loss of function Ile269Asn allele significantly increases obesity 
risk, the presence of at least one functional MC4R allele seems sufficient to 
allow short-term weight loss in response to dietary restriction, phentermine and 
RYGB. Thus, these three different interventions may be useful for the short-term 
treatment of obesity in MC4R Ile269Asn mutation carriers."
1699,"As a consequence of the implementation of NGS technologies, the diagnostic yield 
of neurodevelopmental disorders has dramatically increased during the past two 
decades. Among neurodevelopmental genes, transcription-related genes and 
chromatin remodeling genes are the most represented category of disease-causing 
genes. Indeed, the term ""chromatinopathies"" is now widely used to describe 
epigenetic disorders caused by mutations in these genes. We hereby describe a 
twenty-seven-year-old female patient diagnosed with moderate intellectual 
disability comorbid with other neuropsychiatric and behavioral issues carrying a 
de novo heterozygous stop variant in the KDM5C gene (NM_004187.5: c. 3847G&gt;T, 
p.Glu1283*), encoding a histone demethylase that specifically acts on the H3K4 
lysines. The gene is located on the X chromosome and has been associated with 
Claes-Jensen-type intellectual disability, an X-linked syndromic disorder. We 
discuss our case in relation to previously reported affected females harboring 
pathogenic mutations in the KDM5C gene with the objective of delineating 
genotype-phenotype correlations and further defining a common recognizable 
phenotype. We also highlight the importance of reverse phenotyping in relation 
to whole-exome sequencing results."
1700,"The advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) have enabled the 
characterisation of biological processes at an unprecedented level of detail; 
most hypotheses in molecular biology rely on analyses of HTS data. However, 
achieving increased robustness and reproducibility of results remains a main 
challenge. Although variability in results may be introduced at various stages, 
e.g., alignment, summarisation or detection of differential expression, one 
source of variability was systematically omitted: the sequencing design, which 
propagates through analyses and may introduce an additional layer of technical 
variation. We illustrate qualitative and quantitative differences arising from 
splitting samples across lanes on bulk and single-cell sequencing. For bulk 
mRNAseq data, we focus on differential expression and enrichment analyses; for 
bulk ChIPseq data, we investigate the effect on peak calling and the peaks' 
properties. At the single-cell level, we concentrate on identifying cell 
subpopulations. We rely on markers used for assigning cell identities; both 
smartSeq and 10× data are presented. The observed reduction in the number of 
unique sequenced fragments limits the level of detail on which the different 
prediction approaches depend. Furthermore, the sequencing stochasticity adds in 
a weighting bias corroborated with variable sequencing depths and (yet 
unexplained) sequencing bias. Subsequently, we observe an overall reduction in 
sequencing complexity and a distortion in the biological signal across 
technologies, experimental contexts, organisms and tissues."
1701,"The Amazon-Orinoco plume (AOP) is the world's largest freshwater and sediment 
discharge into the ocean. Previous studies limited to mtDNA suggest that the 
swimming crab Callinectes ornatus Ordway, 1863 exists as two distinct genetic 
clusters separated by the AOP. However, questions concerning migration, 
diversification time, and species delimitation are unresolved. Densely sampling 
markers across the genome (SNPs) could elucidate the evolutionary processes 
within this species. Here, we combined mtDNA data and ddRAD-seq to explore the 
diversification patterns and processes within the swimming crab C. ornatus. We 
show great genetic differentiation between groups on the north and south sides 
of the plume but also signs of hybridization. Demographic modeling indicates the 
divergence between groups starting around 8 Mya following the AOP's formation. 
After a period of isolation, we detect two incidences of secondary contact with 
stronger migration in concordance with the North Brazil Current flow. Our 
results suggest speciation with gene flow explained by the interplay among the 
AOP, oceanographic currents, and long larval dispersal. This work represents the 
first investigation employing ddRAD-seq in a marine invertebrate species with 
distribution encompassing the north and south Atlantic and sheds light on the 
role of the AOP in the diversification of a marine species."
1702,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the 
etiological agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has 
affected the lives of billions and killed millions of infected people. This 
virus has been demonstrated to have different outcomes among individuals, with 
some of them presenting a mild infection, while others present severe symptoms 
or even death. The identification of the molecular states related to the 
severity of a COVID-19 infection has become of the utmost importance to 
understanding the differences in critical immune response. In this study, we 
computationally processed a set of publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq 
(scRNA-Seq) data of 12 Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) samples diagnosed as 
having a mild, severe, or no infection, and generated a high-quality dataset 
that consists of 63,734 cells, each with 23,916 genes. We extended the cell-type 
and sub-type composition identification and our analysis showed significant 
differences in cell-type composition in mild and severe groups compared to the 
normal. Importantly, inflammatory responses were dramatically elevated in the 
severe group, which was evidenced by the significant increase in macrophages, 
from 10.56% in the normal group to 20.97% in the mild group and 34.15% in the 
severe group. As an indicator of immune defense, populations of T cells 
accounted for 24.76% in the mild group and decreased to 7.35% in the severe 
group. To verify these findings, we developed several artificial neural networks 
(ANNs) and graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) models. We showed that the 
GCNN models reach a prediction accuracy of the infection of 91.16% using data 
from subtypes of macrophages. Overall, our study indicates significant 
differences in the gene expression profiles of inflammatory response and immune 
cells of severely infected patients."
1703,"Despite extensive industrial use, the biocompatibility of nanocomposites has not 
been extensively explored. The present study was designed to report the effect 
of variable doses of a newly synthesized nanocomposite, Neodymium Zirconate Zinc 
Sulfide, on selective serum and complete blood count parameters and on the 
oxidative stress markers from the vital organs of albino mice. Albino mice 
(C57BL/6 strain, 5 weeks old) of both sexes were orally treated for 11 days, 
either with 10 mg (low dose) or 20 mg/mL saline/kg body weight (high dose) of 
Neodymium Zirconate Zinc Sulfide nanocomposite. A control group that was not 
treated with the nanocomposite but with saline solution was also maintained. 
Data analysis revealed that high-dose nanocomposite-treated male mice had 
significantly reduced hemoglobin concentration as compared to the control males. 
Female mice treated with both doses of nanocomposite had higher serum 
triglyceride levels than controls. High-dose-treated female mice had elevated 
serum cholesterol concentration compared to their saline-treated controls. 
Oxidative stress marker analysis from selected organs indicated that 
concentrations of malonaldehyde (MDA) in the kidney and liver, Superoxide 
dismutase (SOD) levels in the brain and catalase in the kidney of male mice 
treated with the nanocomposite were significantly higher than in the control 
group, whereas SOD in the heart, MDA in the heart and kidney and catalase levels 
in the kidney were significantly disrupted in female mice compared to their 
respective controls."
1704,"Water availability is considered as the main limiting factor of wheat growth 
illuminating the need of cultivars best adapted to drought situations for better 
wheat production and yield. Among these, the stay-green trait is thought to be 
related to the ability of wheat plants to maintain photosynthesis and CO2 
assimilation, and a detailed molecular understanding of this trait may help in 
the selection of high-yielding, drought-tolerant wheats. The current study, 
therefore, evaluated the physiological responses of the selected wheat genotypes 
under pot-induced water stress conditions through different field capacities. 
The study also focused on exploring the molecular mechanisms involved in drought 
tolerance conferred due to the stay-green trait by studying the expression 
pattern of the selected PSI-associated light-harvesting complex I (LHC1) and 
PSII-associated LHCII gene families related to pigment-binding proteins. The 
results revealed that the studied traits, including relative water content, 
membrane stability index and chlorophyll, were variably and negatively affected, 
while the proline content was positively enhanced in the studied wheats under 
water stress treatments. Molecular diagnosis of the selected wheat genotypes 
using the expression profile of 06 genes, viz. TaLhca1, TaLhca2, TaLhca3, 
TaLhcb1, TaLhcb4 and TaLhcb6 that encodes for the LHCI and LHCII proteins, 
indicated variable responses to different levels of drought stress. The results 
obtained showed the relation between the genotypes and the severity of the 
drought stress condition. Among the studied genotypes, Chirya-1 and SD-28 
performed well with a higher level of gene expression under drought stress 
conditions and may be used in genetic crosses to enrich the genetic background 
of common wheat against drought stress."
1705,"Whether DNA methylation modification affects the gene transcription and 
expression of potatoes under drought stress is still unknown. In this study, we 
used comparative transcriptomics to explore the expression pattern of related 
genes of the drought-tolerant variety Qingshu 9 (Q) and the drought-sensitive 
variety Atlantic (A) under drought stress and DNA methylation inhibitor 
treatment. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the 
number of DEGs between the two varieties' responses to mannitol and 5-azad C, 
especially when they were co-treated with two reagents, and the gene expression 
of Q was more sensitive to mannitol after two hours. Furthermore, we found that 
these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in DNA 
replication, transcription, translation, carbohydrate metabolism, 
photosynthesis, signal transduction, and glutathione metabolism. These results 
indicate that the difference in the background of methylation leads to the 
difference in drought resistance of the two varieties. The complexity of the DNA 
methylation of variety Q might be higher than that of variety A, and the method 
of methylation regulation is more refined. This study systematically expands the 
understanding of the molecular mechanism wherein DNA methylation regulates the 
response to drought stress."
1706,"Background: tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) as a novel non-coding RNA have been 
studied in many cardiovascular diseases, but the relationship between tsRNAs and 
septic cardiomyopathy has not been investigated. We sought to analyze changes of 
the expression profile of tsRNAs in septic cardiomyopathy and reveal an 
important role for tsRNAs. Methods: We constructed a sepsis model by cecal 
ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice, and microarray analysis was used to find 
differentially expressed tsRNAs. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to verify 
the expression of tsRNAs and the interference effect of angiogenin (ANG), a key 
nuclease producing tsRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis was used to predict target 
genes and functions. CCK-8 and LDH release assays were used to detect cell 
viability and cell death. Results: A total of 158 tsRNAs were screened, of which 
101 were up-regulated and 57 were down-regulated. A total of 8 tsRNAs were 
verified by qPCR, which was consistent with microarray results. Gene Ontology 
(GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway 
enrichment analyses suggest that these tsRNAs may be associated with the Wnt 
signaling pathway and participate in cellular process. The expression of tsRNAs 
decreased after the interference of the key nuclease ANG, while CCK-8 suggested 
a corresponding decrease in cell viability and an increase in the release of LDH 
(cell death), indicating that tsRNAs can protect cardiomyocytes during the 
development of septic cardiomyopathy, reduced cardiomyocyte death. Conclusions: 
A total of 158 tsRNAs changed significantly in septic cardiomyopathy, and these 
tsRNAs may play a protective role in the development of septic cardiomyopathy."
1707,"Hypoestes forskaolii is one of the most important species of the family 
Acanthaceae, known for its high economic and medicinal importance. It is well 
distributed in the Arab region as well as on the African continent. Previous 
studies on ethnomedicine have reported that H. forskaolii has an anti-parasitic 
effect as well as antimalarial and anthelmintic activities. Previous studies 
mainly focused on the ethnomedicinal properties, hence, there is no information 
on the genomic architecture and phylogenetic positions of the species within the 
tribe Justiceae. The tribe Justicieae is the most taxonomically difficult taxon 
in Acanthoideae due to its unresolved infratribal classification. Therefore, by 
sequencing the complete chloroplast genome (cp genome) of H. forskaolii, we 
explored the evolutionary patterns of the cp genome and reconstructed the 
phylogeny of Justiceae. The cp genome is quadripartite and circular in structure 
and has a length of 151,142 bp. There are 130 genes (86 coding for protein, 36 
coding for tRNA and 8 coding for rRNA) present in the plastome. Analyses of long 
repeats showed only three types of repeats: forward, palindromic and reverse 
were present in the genome. Microsatellites analysis revealed 134 
microsatellites in the cp genome with mononucleotides having the highest 
frequency. Comparative analyses within Justiceae showed that genomes structure 
and gene contents were highly conserved but there is a slight distinction in the 
location of the genes in the inverted repeat and single copy junctions. 
Additionally, it was discovered that the cp genome includes variable hotspots 
that can be utilized as DNA barcodes and tools for determining evolutionary 
relationships in the Justiceae. These regions include: atpH-atpI, trnK-rps16, 
atpB-rbcL, trnT-trnL, psbI-trnS, matK, trnH-psbA, and ndhD. The Bayesian 
inference phylogenetic tree showed that H. forskaolii is a sister to the 
Dicliptra clade and belongs to Diclipterinae. The result also confirms the 
polyphyly of Justicia and inclusion of Diclipterinae within justicioid. This 
research has revealed the phylogenetic position of H. forskaolii and also 
reported the resources that can be used for evolutionary and phylogenetic 
studies of the species and the Justicieae."
1708,"The current gold standard for the definitive diagnosis of fetal aneuploidy uses 
either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, both of which are which 
are invasive procedures carrying a procedure-related risk of miscarriage of up 
to 0.1-0.2%. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis using fetal nucleated red blood 
cells (FNRBCs) isolated from maternal peripheral venous blood would remove this 
risk of miscarriage since these cells can be isolated from the mother's blood. 
We aimed to detect whole-chromosome aneuploidies from single nucleated fetal red 
blood cells using whole-genome amplification followed by massively parallel 
sequencing performed on a semiconductor sequencing platform. Twenty-six single 
cells were picked from the placental villi of twelve patients thought to have a 
normal fetal genotype and who were undergoing elective first-trimester surgical 
termination of pregnancy. Following karyotyping, it was subsequently found that 
two of these cases were also abnormal (one trisomy 15 and one mosaic genotype). 
One single cell from chorionic villus samples for two patients carrying a fetus 
with trisomy 21 and two single cells from women carrying fetuses with T18 were 
also picked. Pooled libraries were sequenced on the Ion Proton and data were 
analysed using Ion Reporter software. We correctly classified fetal genotype in 
all 24 normal cells, as well as the 2 T21 cells, the 2 T18 cells, and the two 
T15 cells. The two cells picked from the fetus with a mosaic result by CVS were 
classified as unaffected, suggesting that this was a case of confined placental 
mosaicism. Fetal sex was correctly assigned in all cases. We demonstrated that 
semiconductor sequencing using commercially available software for data analysis 
can be achieved for the non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of whole-chromosome 
aneuploidy with 100% accuracy."
1709,"Miscanthus sinensis is an ornamental grass, non-food bioenergy crop, and forage 
with high feeding value. It can adapt to many kinds of soil conditions due to 
its high level of resistance to various abiotic stresses. However, a low level 
of seed germination restricts the utilization and application of M. sinensis. It 
is reported that the Homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) gene family 
participates in plant growth and development and ability to cope with outside 
environment stresses, which may potentially regulate seed germination and stress 
resistance in M. sinensis. In this study, a complete overview of M. sinensis 
HD-Zip genes was conducted, including gene structure, conserved motifs, 
chromosomal distribution, and gene duplication patterns. A total of 169 members 
were identified, and the HD-Zip proteins were divided into four subgroups. 
Inter-chromosomal evolutionary analysis revealed that four pairs of tandem 
duplicate genes and 72 segmental duplications were detected, suggesting the 
possible role of gene replication events in the amplification of the M. sinensis 
HD-Zip gene family. There was an uneven distribution of HD-Zip genes on 19 
chromosomes of M. sinensis. Also, evolutionary analysis showed that M. sinensis 
HD-Zip gene family members had more collinearity with monocotyledons and less 
with dicotyledons. The gene structure analysis showed that there were 93.5% of 
proteins with motif 1 and motif 4, while motif 10 was only found in group IV. 
Based on the cis-elements analysis, it appeared that most of the genes were 
related to plant growth and development, various hormones, and abiotic stress. 
Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis showed that Misin06G303300.1 was significantly 
expressed in seed germination and Misin05G030000.1 and Misin06G303300.1 were 
highly expressed under chromium, salt, and drought stress. Results in this study 
will provide a basis for further exploring the potential role of HD-Zip genes in 
stress responses and genetic improvement of M. sinensis seed germination."
1710,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex disease involving altered 
interactomes of transcripts and proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small-noncoding 
RNAs that can interact with specific gene transcripts and an array of other 
vital endogenous non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can influence gene expression. 
Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3) is an imprinted lncRNA that is reported to be 
downregulated in HCC (in both cell lines and tumors). Alcohol Dehydrogenase 4 
(ADH4) is a well-known prognostic protein biomarker for predicting the survival 
outcomes of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma whose expression is regulated 
by miR-664a-3p, which is upregulated in HCC. In this study, we performed a 
battery of robust and systematic in silico analyses to predicate the possible 
lncRNA-miRNA interactions between MEG3, miR-664a-3p, and ADH4. miRNA-mRNA and 
lncRNA-miRNA hybrid structures were primarily obtained, and the minimum free 
energies (MFEs) for the 3'UTR (Untranslated Regions) of ADH4-miR-664a-3p and the 
3'UTR of MEG3-miR-664a-3p interactions were assessed to predict the stability of 
the obtained RNA heteroduplex hybrids. The hybrid with the least minimum free 
energy (MFE) was considered to be the most favorable. The MFEs were around -28.1 
kcal/mol and -31.3 kCal/mol for the ADH4-miR-664a-3p and MEG3-miR-66a-3p RNA 
hybrids, respectively. This demonstrated that lncRNA-MEG3 might be a competitive 
endogenous RNA that acts as a molecular sponge for miR-664a-3p. In summary, our 
interaction analyses results predict the significance of the 
MEG3/miR-664a-3p/ADH4 axis, where MEG3 downregulation results in miR-664a-3p 
overexpression and the subsequential underexpression of ADH4 in HCC, as a novel 
axis of interest that demands further validation."
1711,"Tengchong snow, which has white feathers and black meat, is one of the most 
important black-bone chicken breeds and a genetic treasure of black food in 
China. Although the black meat traits are dominant, there are some chickens with 
white meat traits born in the process of folk selection and breeding. The 
purpose of this study was to compare the differences in skeletal muscle 
development between Tengchong snow black meat chickens (BS) and white meat 
chickens (WS), as well as whether excessive melanin deposition has an effect on 
skeletal muscle development. The BS and WS groups were selected to determine 
their muscle development difference at stages of 1, 7, 14, 21, and 42 days, 
using histological stain methods to analyze the development and composing type 
of breast and leg muscle fibers, as well as the count of melanin in BS muscle 
fibers. Finally, we were validated key candidate genes associated with muscle 
development and melanin synthesis. The results showed that BS breast muscle 
development was inhibited at 7, 14, and 21 days, while the leg muscle was 
inhibited at 7, 14, 21, and 42 days, compared to WS. Melanin deposition was 
present in a temporal migration pattern and was greater in the leg muscles than 
in the breast muscles, and it focused around blood vessels, as well as the 
epithelium, perimysium, endomysium, and connective tissue. Additionally, melanin 
produced an inhibitory effect similar to MSTN during skeletal muscle fiber 
development, and the inhibition was strongest at the stage of melanin entry 
between muscle fibers, but the precise mechanisms need to be confirmed. This 
study revealed that melanin has an inhibitory effect on the early development of 
skeletal muscle, which will provide new insights into the role of melanin in the 
black-boned chicken and theoretical references for the future conservation and 
utilization of black-boned chicken."
1712,"Complications endangering mother or fetus affect around one in seven pregnant 
women. Investigation of the genetic susceptibility to such diseases is of high 
importance for better understanding of the disease biology as well as for 
prediction of individual risk. In this study, we collected and analyzed GWAS 
summary statistics from the FinnGen cohort and UK Biobank for 24 pregnancy 
complications. In FinnGen, we identified 11 loci associated with pregnancy 
hypertension, excessive vomiting, and gestational diabetes. When UK Biobank and 
FinnGen data were combined, we discovered six loci reaching genome-wide 
significance in the meta-analysis. These include rs35954793 in FGF5 
(p=6.1×10-9), rs10882398 in PLCE1 (p=8.9×10-9), and rs167479 in RGL3 
(p=5.2×10-9) for pregnancy hypertension, rs10830963 in MTNR1B (p=4.5×10-41) and 
rs36090025 in TCF7L2 (p=3.4×10-15) for gestational diabetes, and rs2963457 in 
the EBF1 locus (p=6.5×10-9) for preterm birth. In addition to the identified 
genome-wide associations, we also replicated 14 out of 40 previously reported 
GWAS markers for pregnancy complications, including four more 
preeclampsia-related variants. Finally, annotation of the GWAS results 
identified a causal relationship between gene expression in the cervix and 
gestational hypertension, as well as both known and previously uncharacterized 
genetic correlations between pregnancy complications and other traits. These 
results suggest new prospects for research into the etiology and pathogenesis of 
pregnancy complications, as well as early risk prediction for these disorders."
1713,"Heterozygous pathogenic variants in DNM1 are linked to an autosomal dominant 
form of epileptic encephalopathy. Recently, homozygous loss-of-function variants 
in DNM1 were reported to cause an autosomal recessive form of developmental and 
epileptic encephalopathy in unrelated patients. Here, we investigated a 
singleton from a first-degree cousin marriage who presented with facial 
dysmorphism, global developmental delay, seizure disorder, and nystagmus. To 
identify the involvement of any likely genetic cause, diagnostic clinical exome 
sequencing was performed. Comprehensive filtering revealed a single plausible 
candidate variant in DNM1. Sanger sequencing of the trio, the patient, and her 
parents, confirmed the full segregation of the variant. The variant is a 
deletion leading to a premature stop codon and is predicted to cause a protein 
truncation. Structural modeling implicated a complete loss of function of the 
Dynamin 1 (DNM1). Such mutation is predicted to impair the nucleotide binding, 
dimer formation, and GTPase activity of DNM1. Our study expands the phenotypic 
spectrum of pathogenic homozygous loss-of-function variants in DNM1."
1714,"Few studies have addressed how selective pressures have shaped the genetic 
structure of the current Native American populations, and they have mostly 
limited their inferences to admixed Latin American populations. Here, we 
searched for local adaptation signals, based on integrated haplotype scores and 
population branch statistics, in 325 Mexican Indigenous individuals with at 
least 99% Native American ancestry from five previously defined geographical 
regions. Although each region exhibited its own local adaptation profile, only 
PPARG and AJAP1, both negative regulators of the Wnt/β catenin signaling 
pathway, showed significant adaptation signals in all the tested regions. 
Several signals were found, mainly in the genes related to the metabolic 
processes and immune response. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed the 
overrepresentation of selected genes related to several biological 
phenotypes/conditions, such as the immune response and metabolic pathways, in 
agreement with previous studies, suggesting that immunological and metabolic 
pressures are major drivers of human adaptation. Genes related to the gut 
microbiome measurements were overrepresented in all the regions, highlighting 
the importance of studying how humans have coevolved with the microbial 
communities that colonize them. Our results provide a further explanation of the 
human evolutionary history in response to environmental pressures in this 
region."
1715,"The NFIA (nuclear factor I/A) gene encodes for a transcription factor belonging 
to the nuclear factor I family and has key roles in various embryonic 
differentiation pathways. In humans, NFIA is the major contributor to the 
phenotypic traits of ""Chromosome 1p32p31 deletion syndrome"". We report on two 
new cases with deletions involving NFIA without any other pathogenic 
protein-coding gene alterations. A cohort of 24 patients with NFIA 
haploinsufficiency as the sole anomaly was selected by reviewing the literature 
and public databases in order to analyze all clinical features reported and 
their relative frequencies. This process was useful because it provided an 
overall picture of the phenotypic outcome of NFIA haploinsufficiency and helped 
to define a cluster of phenotypic traits that can facilitate clinicians in 
identifying affected patients. NFIA haploinsufficiency can be suspected by a 
careful observation of the dysmorphisms (macrocephaly, craniofacial, and 
first-finger anomalies), and this potential diagnosis is strengthened by the 
presence of intellectual and developmental disabilities or other 
neurodevelopmental disorders. Further clues of NFIA haploinsufficiency can be 
provided by instrumental tests such as MRI and kidney urinary tract ultrasound 
and confirmed by genetic testing."
1716,"Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), an economically important and nutritionally rich 
Cucurbitaceous crop grown worldwide, is severely affected by bacterial fruit 
blotch (BFB). Development of resistant cultivar is the most eco-friendly, 
cost-effective, and sustainable way to tackle this disease. This requires wider 
understanding of the genetics of resistance to BFB. In this study, we identified 
quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with BFB resistance in an F2 mapping 
population developed from BFB-resistant 'PI 189225' (Citrullus amarus) and 
-susceptible 'SW 26' (C. lanatus) genotypes based on the polymorphic markers 
identified by genotyping by sequencing (GSB). A linkage map covering a total 
genetic distance of 3377.1 cM was constructed. Two QTLs for BFB resistance, 
namely, ClBFB10.1 and ClBFB10.2, both located on chromosome 10 explaining 18.84 
and 15.41% of the phenotypic variations, respectively, were identified. Two 
SNP-based high-resolution melting (HRM) markers WmBFB10.1 and WmBFB10.2 having 
high positive correlation with resistance vs. susceptible alleles were 
developed. The efficacy of the markers was validated in another F2 population 
derived from SW34 × PI 189225. The highest phenotypic variation was found in the 
locus ClBFB10.2, which also contains three putative candidate genes for 
resistance to BFB. These findings will accelerate the development of 
BFB-resistant watermelon varieties via molecular breeding."
1717,"High temperature is a major stress in rice production. Although considerable 
progress has been made in investigating heat tolerance (HT) in rice, the genetic 
basis of HT at the heading stage remains largely unknown. In this study, a novel 
set of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) consisting of 113 lines 
derived from a heat-resistant indica variety N22 and a heat-sensitive indica 
variety 9311 was developed and used for the analysis of the genetic basis of HT. 
The heat sensitivity index (HSI) calculated based on seed-setting rates under 
natural and high-temperature environments was used to evaluate the influence of 
HT at the rice heading stage. In total, five quantitative trait loci (QTLs) 
associated with HT were detected based on seed-setting rate (SSR) evaluation; 
these were named qSSR6-1, qSSR7-1, qSSR8-1, qSSR9-1 and qSSR11-1 located on 
chromosomes 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11, respectively. Heat-tolerant alleles of the QTLs 
were all derived from N22. Among them, qSSR9-1 overlapped with QTLs identified 
previously, while the remaining QTLs were found novel. In particular, qSSR7-1 
explained a high phenotypic variation of 26.35% with a LOD score of 10.75, thus 
deserved to be further validated. These findings will increase our understanding 
of the genetic mechanism underlying HT and facilitate the breeding of 
heat-tolerant rice varieties."
1718,"The extensive use of genomic selection (GS) in livestock and crops has led to a 
series of genomic-prediction (GP) algorithms despite the lack of a single 
algorithm that can suit all the species and traits. A systematic evaluation of 
available GP algorithms is thus necessary to identify the optimal GP algorithm 
for selective breeding in aquaculture species. In this study, a systematic 
comparison of ten GP algorithms, including both traditional and machine-learning 
algorithms, was conducted using publicly available genotype and phenotype data 
of eight traits, including weight and disease resistance traits, from five 
aquaculture species. The study aimed to provide insights into the optimal 
algorithm for GP in aquatic animals. Notably, no algorithm showed the best 
performance in all traits. However, reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and 
support-vector machine (SVM) algorithms achieved relatively high prediction 
accuracies in most of the tested traits. Bayes A and random forest (RF) better 
prevented noise interference in the phenotypic data compared to the other 
algorithms. The prediction performances of GP algorithms in the Crassostrea 
gigas dataset were improved by using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to 
select subsets of significant SNPs. An R package, ""ASGS,"" which integrates the 
commonly used traditional and machine-learning algorithms for efficiently 
finding the optimal algorithm, was developed to assist the application of 
genomic selection breeding of aquaculture species. This work provides valuable 
information and a tool for optimizing algorithms for GP, aiding genetic breeding 
in aquaculture species."
1719,"It is well known that first-trimester miscarriages are associated with 
chromosome abnormalities, with numerical chromosome abnormalities being the ones 
most commonly detected. Conventional karyotyping is still considered the gold 
standard in the analysis of products of conception, despite the extended use of 
molecular genetic techniques. However, conventional karyotyping is a laborious 
and time-consuming method, with a limited resolution of 5-10 Mb and hampered by 
maternal cell contamination and culture failure. The aim of our study was to 
assess the type and frequency of chromosomal abnormalities detected by 
conventional karyotyping in specimens of sporadic first-trimester miscarriages 
in a Romanian cohort, using QF-PCR to exclude maternal cell contamination. 
Long-term cultures were established and standard protocols were applied for cell 
harvesting, slide preparation, and GTG banding. All samples with 46,XX karyotype 
were tested for maternal cell contamination by QF-PCR, comparing multiple 
microsatellite markers in maternal blood with cell culture and tissue samples. 
Out of the initial 311 specimens collected from patients with sporadic 
first-trimester miscarriages, a total of 230 samples were successfully analyzed 
after the exclusion of 81 specimens based on unsuitable sampling, culture 
failure, or QF-PCR-proven maternal cell contamination. Chromosome abnormalities 
were detected in 135 cases (58.7%), with the most common type being single 
autosomal trisomy (71/135-52.6%), followed by monosomy (monosomy X being the 
only one detected, 24/135-17.8%), and polyploidy (23/135-17.0%). The subgroup 
analysis based on maternal age showed a statistically significant higher rate of 
single trisomy for women aged 35 years or older (40.3%) compared to the young 
maternal age group (26.1%) (p = 0.029). In conclusion, the combination of 
conventional karyotyping and QF-PCR can lead to an increased chromosome 
abnormality detection rate in first-trimester miscarriages. Our study provides 
reliable information for the genetic counseling of patients with first-trimester 
miscarriages, and further large-scale studies using different genetic techniques 
are required."
1720,"X-linked Myopathy with Excessive Autophagy (XMEA) is a rare autophagic vacuolar 
myopathy caused by mutations in the Vacuolar ATPase assembly factor VMA21 gene; 
onset usually occurs during childhood and rarely occurs during adulthood. We 
described a 22-year-old patient with XMEA, whose onset was declared at 11 
through gait disorder. He had severe four-limb proximal weakness and amyotrophy, 
and his proximal muscle MRC score was between 2 and 3/5 in four limbs; creatine 
kinase levels were elevated (1385 IU/L), and electroneuromyography and muscle 
MRI were suggestive of myopathy. Muscle biopsy showed abnormalities typical of 
autophagic vacuolar myopathy. We detected a hemizygous, unreported, intronic, 
single-nucleotide substitution c.164-20T&gt;A (NM_001017980.4) in intron 2 of 
the VMA21 gene. Fibroblasts derived from this patient displayed a reduced level 
of VMA21 transcripts (at 40% of normal) and protein, suggesting a pathogenicity 
related to an alteration of the splicing efficiency associated with an intron 
retention. This patient with XMEA displayed a severe phenotype (rapid weakness 
of upper and lower limbs) due to a new intronic variant of VMA21, related to an 
alteration in the splicing efficiency associated with intron retention, 
suggesting that phenotype severity is closely related to the residual expression 
of the VMA21 protein."
1721,"Necroptosis is a newly developed cell death pathway that differs from necrosis 
and apoptosis; however, the potential mechanism of necroptosis-related genes in 
EAC and whether they are associated with the prognosis of EAC patients remain 
unclear. We obtained 159 NRGs from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) and performed differential expression analysis of the NRGs in 9 normal 
samples and 78 EAC tumor samples derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 
Finally, we screened 38 differentially expressed NRGs (DE-NRGs). The results of 
the GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the DE-NRGs were mainly enriched in the 
functions and pathways associated with necroptosis. Protein interaction network 
(PPI) analysis revealed that TNF, CASP1, and IL-1B were the core genes of the 
network. A risk score model based on four DE-NRGs was constructed by Least 
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, and the results 
showed that the higher the risk score, the worse the survival. The model 
achieved more efficient diagnosis compared with the clinicopathological 
variables, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
of 0.885. The prognostic value of this model was further validated using Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) 
demonstrated that several metabolism-related pathways were activated in the 
high-risk population. Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) provided further confirmation 
that this prognostic model was remarkably associated with the immune status of 
EAC patients. Finally, the nomogram map exhibited a certain prognostic 
prediction efficiency, with a C-index of 0.792 and good consistency. Thus, the 
prognostic model based on four NRGs could better predict the prognosis of EAC 
and help to elucidate the mechanism of necroptosis-related genes in EAC, which 
can provide guidance for the target prediction and clinical treatment of EAC 
patients."
1722,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease and 
continues to be a threat to patients with diabetes. Dysfunction of glomerular 
mesangial cells (GMCs) is the main contributing factor to glomerulosclerosis, 
which is a pathological feature of DN. The epigenetic factor ASH2L has long been 
thought to be a transcriptional activator, but its function and involvement in 
diabetic nephropathy is still unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of ASH2L 
on the regulation of fibrosis and inflammation induced by high glucose in mouse 
mesangial cells (mMCs). We observed that ASH2L expression is increased in high 
glucose-induced mMCs, while loss of ASH2L alleviated fibrosis and inflammation. 
Furthermore, ASH2L-mediates H3K4me3 of the homeodomain-interacting protein 
kinase 2 (HIPK2) promoter region, which is a contributor to fibrosis in the 
kidneys and promotes its transcriptional expression. Similar to loss of ASH2L, 
silencing HIPK2 also inhibited fibrosis and inflammation. In addition, ASH2L and 
HIPK2 are upregulated in the kidneys of both streptozocin-induced and db/db 
mouse. In conclusion, we uncovered the crucial role of ASH2L in high 
glucose-induced fibrosis and inflammation, suggesting that ASH2L regulation may 
be an attractive approach to attenuate the progression of DN."
1723,"Homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) transcription factors are one of the 
plant-specific gene families involved in plant growth and response to adverse 
environmental conditions. However, little information is available on the HD-ZIP 
gene family in watermelon. In this study, forty ClHDZs were systemically 
identified in the watermelon genome, which were subsequently divided into four 
distinctive subfamilies (I-IV) based on the phylogenetic topology. HD-ZIP 
members in the same subfamily generally shared similar gene structures and 
conserved motifs. Syntenic analyses revealed that segmental duplications mainly 
contributed to the expansion of the watermelon HD-ZIP family, especially in 
subfamilies I and IV. HD-ZIP III was considered the most conserved subfamily 
during the evolutionary history. Moreover, expression profiling together with 
stress-related cis-elements in the promoter region unfolded the divergent 
transcriptional accumulation patterns under abiotic stresses. The majority 
(13/23) of ClHDZs in subfamilies I and II were downregulated under the drought 
condition, e.g., ClHDZ4, ClHDZ13, ClHDZ18, ClHDZ19, ClHDZ20, and ClHDZ35. On the 
contrary, most HD-ZIP genes were induced by cold and salt stimuli with few 
exceptions, such as ClHDZ3 and ClHDZ23 under cold stress and ClHDZ14 and ClHDZ15 
under the salt condition. Notably, the gene ClHDZ14 was predominantly 
downregulated by three stresses whereas ClHDZ1 was upregulated, suggesting their 
possible core roles in response to these abiotic stimuli. Collectively, our 
findings provide promising candidates for the further genetic improvement of 
abiotic stress tolerance in watermelon."
1724,"Small heat shock proteins (HSP20s) are a significant factor in plant growth and 
development in response to abiotic stress. In this study, we investigated the 
role of HSP20s' response to the heat stress of Sorbus pohuashanensis introduced 
into low-altitude areas. The HSP20 gene family was identified based on the 
genome-wide data of S. pohuashanensis, and the expression patterns of tissue 
specificity and the response to abiotic stresses were evaluated. Finally, we 
identified 38 HSP20 genes that were distributed on 16 chromosomes. Phylogenetic 
analysis of HSP20s showed that the closest genetic relationship to S. 
pohuashanensis (SpHSP20s) is Malus domestica, followed by Populus trichocarpa 
and Arabidopsis thaliana. According to phylogenetic analysis and subcellular 
localization prediction, the 38 SpHSP20s belonged to 10 subfamilies. Analysis of 
the gene structure and conserved motifs indicated that HSP20 gene family members 
are relatively conserved. Synteny analysis showed that the expansion of the 
SpHSP20 gene family was mainly caused by segmental duplication. In addition, 
many cis-acting elements connected with growth and development, hormones, and 
stress responsiveness were found in the SpHSP20 promoter region. Analysis of 
expression patterns showed that these genes were closely related to high 
temperature, drought, salt, growth, and developmental processes. These results 
provide information and a theoretical basis for the exploration of HSP20 gene 
family resources, as well as the domestication and genetic improvement of S. 
pohuashanensis."
1725,"Both ZeBrafish (ZB), a recently identified DNA transposon in the zebrafish 
genome, and SB, a reconstructed transposon originally discovered in several fish 
species, are known to exhibit high transposition activity in vertebrate cells. 
Although a similar structural organization was observed for ZB and SB 
transposons, the evolutionary profiles of their homologs in various species 
remain unknown. In the present study, we compared their taxonomic ranges, 
structural arrangements, sequence identities, evolution dynamics, and horizontal 
transfer occurrences in vertebrates. In total, 629 ZB and 366 SB homologs were 
obtained and classified into four distinct clades, named ZB, ZB-like, SB, and 
SB-like. They displayed narrow taxonomic distributions in eukaryotes, and were 
mostly found in vertebrates, Actinopterygii in particular tended to be the major 
reservoir hosts of these transposons. Similar structural features and high 
sequence identities were observed for transposons and transposase, notably 
homologous to the SB and ZB elements. The genomic sequences that flank the ZB 
and SB transposons in the genomes revealed highly conserved integration profiles 
with strong preferential integration into AT repeats. Both SB and ZB transposons 
experienced horizontal transfer (HT) events, which were most common in 
Actinopterygii. Our current study helps to increase our understanding of the 
evolutionary properties and histories of SB and ZB transposon families in 
animals."
1726,"The molecular mechanisms and gene regulatory networks sustaining cell 
proliferation in neuroblastoma (NBL) cells are still not fully understood. In 
this tumor context, it has been proposed that anti-proliferative drugs, such as 
the pan-HDAC inhibitor panobinostat, could be tested to mitigate tumor 
progression. Here, we set out to investigate the effects of panobinostat 
treatment at the unprecedented resolution offered by single-cell sequencing. We 
identified a global senescence signature paired with reduction in proliferation 
in treated Kelly cells and more isolated transcriptional responses compatible 
with early neuronal differentiation. Using master regulator analysis, we 
identified BAZ1A, HCFC1, MAZ, and ZNF146 as the transcriptional regulators most 
significantly repressed by panobinostat. Experimental silencing of these 
transcription factors (TFs) confirmed their role in sustaining NBL cell 
proliferation in vitro."
1727,"Bupleurum falcatum L. is frequently used in traditional herbal medicine in Asia. 
Saikosaponins (SSs) are the main bioactive ingredients of B.&amp;nbsp;falcatum, 
but the biosynthetic pathway of SSs is unclear, and the biosynthesis of 
species-specific phytometabolites is little known. Here we resolved the 
transcriptome profiles of B.&amp;nbsp;falcatum to identify candidate genes that 
might be involved in the biosynthesis of SSs. By isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) 
analyses of the whole plant, a total of 26.98 Gb of nucleotides were obtained 
and 124,188 unigenes were identified, and 81,594 unigenes were successfully 
annotated. A total of 1033 unigenes of 20 families related to the mevalonate 
(MVA) pathway and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway of the SS 
biosynthetic pathway were identified. The WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis) of these unigenes revealed that only the co-expression module 
of MEmagenta, which contained 343 unigenes, was highly correlated with the 
biosynthesis of SSs. Comparing differentially expressed gene analysis and the 
WGCNA indicated that 130 out of 343 genes of the MEmagenta module exhibited 
differential expression levels, and genes with the most ""hubness"" within this 
module were predicted. Manipulation of these genes might improve the 
biosynthesis of SSs."
1728,"Structural variations such as copy number variants (CNVs) have been associated 
with multiple autoimmune diseases. In this study, we explored the association of 
the Fc gamma receptor 3B gene (FCGR3B) copy number variation (CNV) with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility and related serological traits in the 
Pakistani population. We also performed a meta-analysis of four published FCGR3B 
CNV studies along with the current study. A total of 927 subjects (597 RA cases, 
330 healthy controls) were recruited from three rheumatology centers in 
Pakistan. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies and rheumatoid 
factor (RF) were measured in RA patients. FCGR3B copy number was assayed using 
the TaqMan® CN assay (Hs04211858_cn, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) 
and the copy number was estimated by using CopyCaller® software (version 2.1; 
Applied Biosystems, USA). Logistic regression was applied to calculate the odds 
ratio (OR) of RA risk associated with FCGR3B CNV using sex and age as covariates 
in R. Meta-analysis on four previously published studies and the current study 
was performed using the random-effect model. We observed a significant 
association between FCGR3B copy number &lt; 2 and RA susceptibility (OR = 1.53; 
95% CI: 1.05 to 2.22; p = 0.0259) and anti-CCP seropositivity (OR 2.56; 95% CI: 
1.34 to 4.89; p = 0.0045). A non-significant association of FCGR3B copy number 
&lt; 2 was also observed between increased rheumatoid factor (RF) seropositivity 
(OR = 1.74; 95% CI:0.93 to 3.26; p = 0.0816). Meta-analysis on 13,915 subjects 
(7005 RA cases and 6907 controls) also showed significant association of copy 
number &lt; 2 with the increased risk of RA (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.56; p 
= 0.00671). FCGR3B copy number &lt; 2 is associated with increased RA risk and 
anti-CCP seropositivity."
1729,"Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv; v for ""variant"") is the most common 
form of hereditary amyloidosis, with an autosomal dominant inheritance and a 
variable penetrance. This disease has a significant variability in clinical 
presentation and multiorgan involvement. While kidney involvement in early-onset 
ATTRv has been reported in one-third of patients, in late-onset ATTRv it has 
generally been considered rare. In the present study, we describe trajectories 
of kidney function over time before and after treatment with gene silencing 
therapies in a cohort of 17 ATTRv patients with different mutations, coming from 
Italy (nine subjects treated with inotersen and eight patients treated with 
patisiran). The analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slopes 
revealed that the average change in eGFR was 0.01 mL/min/1.73 m2 per month 
before initiation and -0.23 mL/min/1.73 m2 per month during follow-up for 
inotersen and -0.62 mL/min/1.73 m2 per month before initiation and -0.20 
mL/min/1.73 m2 per month during follow-up for patisiran. In conclusion, we did 
not observe any significant difference either between the two groups of 
treatment or within-group before and after therapy, so gene-silencing therapies 
may be considered safe for renal function in ATTRv and are not associated with a 
worsening of eGFR slope."
1730,"Eugenia uniflora is a Brazilian native plant species with great ecological and 
economic importance. It is distributed throughout the Atlantic forest, where two 
distinct populations show local adaptation to the contrasting conditions of 
restinga and riparian forest. Among various TFs described in plants, the DOF TF 
family has been reported to affect flowering and vascular development, making 
them promising candidates for characterization in E. uniflora. In this study, 28 
DOF genes were identified by a genome-wide analysis, of which 20 were grouped 
into 11 MCOGs by Bayesian phylogeny, suggesting a shared functionallity between 
members. Based on RNA-seq experiments, we have detected eight drought responsive 
genes, and SNPs identification revealed population unique polymorphisms, 
implying a role in local adapatation mechanisms. Finally, analysis of conserved 
motifs through MEME revealed 15 different protein motifs, and a promoter region 
analysis returned 40 enriched TF binding motifs, both reporting novel biological 
functions circa the DOF gene family. In general, the DOF family is found to be 
conserved both in sequence and expression. Furthermore, this study contributes 
to both DOF literature and the genetic exploration of native species, 
elucidating their genetic potential and bringing to light new research topics, 
paving the way to future studies."
1731,"Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), an important root crop, has storage roots rich 
in starch that are edible and serve as a raw material in bioenergy production. 
Increasing the storage-root starch contents is a key sweet potato breeding goal. 
Phosphoglucomutase (PGM) is the catalytic enzyme for the interconversion of 
glucose-6-phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate, precursors in the plant starch 
synthetic pathway. Plant PGMs have plastidial and cytosolic isoforms, based on 
their subcellular localization. Here, IbpPGM, containing 22 exons and 21 
introns, was cloned from the sweet potato line Xu 781. This gene was highly 
expressed in the storage roots and leaves, and its expression was induced by 
exogenous sucrose treatments. The mature IbpPGM protein was successfully 
expressed in Escherichia coli when a 73-aa chloroplastic transit peptide 
detected in the N-terminus was excised. The subcellular localization confirmed 
that IbpPGM was localized to the chloroplasts. The low-starch sweet potato 
cultivar Lizixiang IbpPGM-overexpression lines showed significantly increased 
starch, glucose, and fructose levels but a decreased sucrose level. 
Additionally, the expression levels of the starch synthetic pathway genes in the 
storage roots were up-regulated to different extents. Thus, IbpPGM significantly 
increased the starch content of the sweet potato storage roots, which makes it a 
candidate gene for the genetic engineering of the sweet potato."
1732,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the five most common cancers in the world and 
unfortunately has a high mortality rate. To date, the pathogenesis and disease 
genes of GC are unclear, so the need for new diagnostic and prognostic 
strategies for GC is undeniable. Despite particular findings in this regard, a 
holistic approach encompassing molecular data from different biological levels 
for GC has been lacking. To translate Big Data into system-level biomarkers, in 
this study, we integrated three different GC gene expression data with three 
different biological networks for the first time and captured biologically 
significant (i.e., reporter) transcripts, hub proteins, transcription factors, 
and receptor molecules of GC. We analyzed the revealed biomolecules with 
independent RNA-seq data for their diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. While 
this holistic approach uncovered biomolecules already associated with GC, it 
also revealed novel system biomarker candidates for GC. Classification 
performances of novel candidate biomarkers with machine learning approaches were 
investigated. With this study, AES, CEBPZ, GRK6, HPGDS, SKIL, and SP3 were 
identified for the first time as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker 
candidates for GC. Consequently, we have provided valuable data for further 
experimental and clinical efforts that may be useful for the diagnosis and/or 
prognosis of GC."
1733,"The aim of this study is to investigate whether the genetic, epigenetic and 
environmental factors that give rise to supernumeraries in the maxillary incisor 
region and larger dimensions of the adjacent maxillary incisors are also 
associated with variations in the morphology of the mandibular incisors. If so, 
this would contribute to understanding the distribution and interactions of 
factors during dental development and how these can be modelled. The sample 
consisted of 34 patients with supernumerary teeth in the maxillary anterior 
region, matched for gender, age and White Caucasian ethnicity with 34 control 
subjects. The average ages of the supernumerary and control groups were 12.8 and 
12.2 years, respectively. Study models of all subjects were constructed and 
imaged using a previously validated system. Using custom software, each of the 
mandibular incisor teeth were measured to obtain 17 parameters from the labial 
view and 17 from the occlusal view. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used 
to summarize the measurements into a smaller set representing distinct features 
of the clinical crowns, followed by a comparison between the supernumerary and 
control groups using 2-way ANOVA. Seven factors of tooth size of the mandibular 
central incisors and six factors of the mandibular lateral incisors were 
identified as major features of the clinical crowns. All parameters of both 
mandibular incisors were greater in the supernumerary group than in the control, 
with three of these, located in the incisal and cervical regions of the 
mandibular lateral incisors, being statistically significantly larger. The 
findings of this study indicate that the aetiological factors associated with 
supernumerary teeth in the maxillary anterior region also affect tooth crown 
dimensions of mandibular incisors. This new evidence enhances several models of 
the interactions of genetic, epigenetic and environmental components of dental 
development and supports a multi-model approach to increase understanding of 
this process and its variations."
1734,"Laportea bulbifera (L. bulbifera) is an important medicinal plant of Chinese 
ethnic minorities, with high economic and medicinal value. However, the 
medicinal materials of the genus Laportea are prone to be misidentified due to 
the similar morphological characteristics of the original plants. Thus, it is 
crucial to discover their molecular marker points and to precisely identify 
these species for their exploitation and conservation. Here, this study reports 
detailed information on the complete chloroplast (cp) of L. bulbifera. The 
result indicates that the cp genome of L. bulbifera of 150,005 bp contains 126 
genes, among them, 37 tRNA genes and 81 protein-coding genes. The analysis of 
repetition demonstrated that palindromic repeats are more frequent. In the 
meantime, 39 SSRs were also identified, the majority of which were 
mononucleotides Adenine-Thymine (A-T). Furthermore, we compared L. bulbifera 
with eight published Laportea plastomes, to explore highly polymorphic molecular 
markers. The analysis identified four hypervariable regions, including rps16, 
ycf1, trnC-GCA and trnG-GCC. According to the phylogenetic analysis, L. 
bulbifera was most closely related to Laportea canadensis (L. canadensis), and 
the molecular clock analysis speculated that the species originated from 1.8216 
Mya. Overall, this study provides a more comprehensive analysis of the evolution 
of L. bulbifera from the perspective of phylogenetic and intrageneric molecular 
variation in the genus Laportea, which is useful for providing a scientific 
basis for further identification, taxonomic, and evolutionary studies of the 
genus."
1735,"(1) Background: Numerous etiologies may lead to non-immune hydrops fetalis 
(NIHF). However, the causes remain unclear in half of NIHF cases following 
current standard assessment. The application of prenatal chromosomal microarray 
analysis (CMA) and exome sequencing (ES) can improve the identification of the 
etiologies. This study aimed to investigate the etiologies of NIHF in the era of 
next-generation sequence (NGS) following a unified prenatal work-up flow for 
diagnosis. (2) Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on NIHF cases 
that were collected prospectively to explore the underlying etiologies according 
to a unified prenatal diagnosis work-up flow at Shanghai First Maternity and 
Infant Hospital between Jan 2016 and Dec 2019. The medical records for all NIHF 
cases were reviewed, and the causes of NIHF were classified as confirmed 
(diagnostic), suspected, or unknown. (3) Results: Prenatal and postnatal medical 
records for a total of 145 NIHF cases were reviewed, 48.3% (70/145) of the cases 
were identified to be with confirmed etiologies, and 10.3% (15/145) with 
suspected etiologies. Among 85 cases with confirmed or suspected etiologies, 
44.7% were diagnosed with genetic disorders, 20% with chylothorax/chyloascites 
diagnosed postnatally, 12.9% with fetal structural anomalies, 12.9% with fetal 
anemia, 7% (6 cases) with fetal arrhythmia, and 2.3% (2 cases) with placenta 
chorioangioma. In cases with genetic disorders, 8 aneuploidies were detected by 
CMA, and 30 cases had single-gene disorders identified by ES (29/30) or targeted 
gene panel (1/30). There were still 41.4% cases (60/145) with unknown causes 
after this unified prenatal diagnostic work-up flow. (4) Conclusions: In the era 
of NGS, the causes of NIHF were identified in 58.6% of cases, with genetic 
disorders being the most common ones. NGS is helpful in determining the genetic 
etiology of NIHF when CMA results cannot explain NIHF, but 41.4% of cases were 
still with unknown causes under the unified prenatal diagnostic work-up flow in 
this single-center study."
1736,"Paeonia suffruticosa Andr., a member of Paeoniaceae, is native to China. In its 
1600 years' cultivation, more than 2000 cultivars for different purposes 
(ornamental, medicinal and oil use) have been inbred. However, there are still 
some controversies regarding the provenance of tree peony cultivars and the 
phylogenetic relationships between and within different cultivar groups. In this 
study, plastid genome sequencing was performed on 10 representative tree peony 
cultivars corresponding to 10 different flower types. Structure and comparative 
analyses of the plastid genomes showed that the total lengths of the chloroplast 
genome of the 10 cultivars ranged from 152,153 to 152,385 bp and encoded 84-88 
protein-coding genes, 8 rRNAs and 31-40 tRNAs. The number of simple sequence 
repeats and interspersed repeat sequences of the 10 cultivars ranged from 65-68 
and 40-42, respectively. Plastid phylogenetic relationships of Paeonia 
species/cultivars were reconstructed incorporating data from our newly sequenced 
plastid genomes and 15 published species, and results showed that subsect. 
Vaginatae was the closest relative to the central plains cultivar group with 
robust support, and that it may be involved in the formation of the group. 
Paeonia ostii was recovered as a successive sister group to this lineage. 
Additionally, eleven morphological characteristics of flowers were mapped to the 
phylogenetic skeleton to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of flower 
architecture in Paeoniaceae."
1737,"Mitochondrial introgression raises questions of biogeography and of the extent 
of reproductive isolation and natural selection. Previous phylogenetic work on 
the Sorex araneus complex revealed apparent mitonuclear discordance in Iberian 
shrews, indicating past hybridisation of Sorex granarius and the Carlit 
chromosomal race of S. araneus, enabling introgression of the S. araneus 
mitochondrial genome into S. granarius. To further study this, we genetically 
typed 61 Sorex araneus/coronatus/granarius from localities in Portugal, Spain, 
France, and Andorra at mitochondrial, autosomal, and sex-linked loci and 
combined our data with the previously published sequences. Our data are 
consistent with earlier data indicating that S. coronatus and S. granarius are 
the most closely related of the three species, confirming that S. granarius from 
the Central System mountain range in Spain captured the mitochondrial genome 
from a population of S. araneus. This mitochondrial capture event can be 
explained by invoking a biogeographical scenario whereby S. araneus was in 
contact with S. granarius during the Younger Dryas in central Iberia, despite 
the two species currently having disjunct distributions. We discuss whether 
selection favoured S. granarius with an introgressed mitochondrial genome. Our 
data also suggest recent hybridisation and introgression between S. coronatus 
and S. granarius, as well as between S. araneus and S. coronatus."
1738,"Exploration of and understanding diversity and variability in genotypes of 
germplasm determines the success of rice improvement programs. One of the most 
important determinants of the success of breeding programs is genetic diversity 
and inheritance of traits. Genetic variability analysis helps breeders to 
determine the appropriate selection method and standards to be used to improve 
the preferred trait. The aim of this study was to estimate genetic components, 
heritability and to obtain information about genetic diversity using cluster 
analysis and principal component analysis. Twenty rice genotypes with three 
replicates in a randomized complete block design were analyzed at the 
Experimental Farm at Sakha Agricultural Research Station, Sakha, Kafr El-Sheikh, 
Egypt, during the period from 2017 to 2020. The results of the analysis of 
variance showed that highly significant variations were recorded between the 
studied genotypes for all traits. The genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV%) 
and phenotypic (PCV%) coefficient of variation were moderate for plant height, 
panicles/plant, panicle weight, spikelets/panicle, filled grains/panicle, grain 
yield/plant and amylose content percentage for the first-year, second-year and 
combined data. This indicates the existence of beneficial genetic variability 
that can be exploited to improve these traits. The broad-sense estimates of 
heritability were high and recorded values higher than 60% for all the studied 
traits for the two-year and combined data, except for hulling percentage. This 
indicates that the selection of traits that have high heritability and are less 
affected by the environment leads to an acceleration of the improvement of these 
traits. The results from the cluster analysis and principal component analysis 
revealed a high level of genotypic variation among the studied genotypes and 
genetic diversity between them. One of the most important outcomes of this study 
is the successful utilization of genetic resources (germplasm) from ancient 
varieties and lines of rice in selecting and identifying 17 new restoration 
lines of rice, which have various improvement purposes in rice and hybrid rice 
breeding programs."
1739,"The world population is genetically predisposed to metabolic syndrome (MetS) and 
its components, also known as cardiometabolic risk phenotypes, which can cause 
severe health complications including coronary heart disease (CHD). Genetic 
variants in the 9p21 locus have been associated with CHD in a number of 
populations including Pakistan. However, the role of the 9p21 locus in MetS and 
cardiometabolic risk phenotypes (such as obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, 
and dyslipidemia) in populations with CHD or no established CHD has not been 
explored. Therefore, the present study was designed to explore the association 
of the minor/risk allele (C) of 9p21 locus SNP rs1333049 with MetS or its risk 
phenotypes regardless of an established CHD, in Pakistani subjects. Genotyping 
of rs1333049 (G/C) was performed on subjects under a case-control study design; 
healthy controls and cases, MetS with CHD (MetS-CHD+) and MetS with no CHD 
(MetS-CHD-), respectively. Genotype and allele frequencies were calculated in 
all study groups. Anthropometric and clinical variables (Means ± SD) were 
compared among study groups (i.e., controls, MetS + CHD and MetS-CHD) and 
minor/risk C allele carriers (GC + CC) vs. non-carriers (Normal GG genotype). 
Associations of the risk allele of rs1333049 SNP with disease and individual 
metabolic risk components were explored using adjusted multivariate logistic 
regression models (OR at 95% CI) with a threshold p-value of ≤0.05. Our results 
have shown that the minor allele frequency (MAF) was significantly high in the 
MAF cases (combined = 0.63, MetS-CHD+ = 0.57 and MetS-CHD- = 0.57) compared with 
controls (MAF = 0.39). The rs1333049 SNP significantly increased the risk of 
MetS, irrespective of CHD (MetS-CHD+ OR = 2.36, p &lt; 0.05 and MetS-CHD- OR = 
4.04, p &lt; 0.05), and cardiometabolic risk phenotypes; general obesity, 
central obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia (OR = 1.56-3.25, p &lt; 0.05) 
except hyperglycemia, which lacked any significant association (OR = 0.19, p = 
0.29) in the present study group. The 9p21 genetic locus/rs1333049 SNP is 
strongly associated with, and can be a genetic predictor of, MetS and 
cardiometabolic risks, irrespective of cardiovascular diseases in the Pakistani 
population."
1740,"Variants in the CES1 gene encoding carboxylesterase 1 may affect the metabolism 
of enalapril to the active metabolite enalaprilat. It was shown that the A 
allele of rs71647871 and the C allele of rs2244613 led to a decrease in plasma 
enalaprilat concentrations. This study aimed to estimate the effect of 
structural haplotypes of CES1 containing the pseudogene CES1P1, or a hybrid of 
the gene and the pseudogene CES1A2, on the pharmacokinetics of enalapril. We 
included 286 Caucasian patients with arterial hypertension treated with 
enalapril. Genotyping was performed using real-time PCR and long-range PCR. Peak 
and trough plasma enalaprilat concentrations were lower in carriers of CES1A2. 
The studied haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with rs2244613: generally, 
the A allele was in the haplotype containing the CES1P1, and the C allele was in 
the haplotype with the CES1A2. Thus, carriers of CES1A2 have reduced CES1 
activity against enalapril. Linkage disequilibrium of the haplotype containing 
the CES1P1 or CES1A2 with rs2244613 should be taken into account when genotyping 
the CES1 gene."
1741,"Bacterial chemotaxis is the phenomenon in which bacteria migrate toward a more 
favorable niche in response to chemical cues in the environment. The 
methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) are the principal sensory receptors 
of the bacterial chemotaxis system. Aerotaxis is a special form of chemotaxis in 
which oxygen serves as the signaling molecule; the process is dependent on the 
aerotaxis receptors (Aer) containing the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain. Over 40 MCPs 
are annotated on the genome of Vibrio cholerae; however, little is known about 
their functions. We investigated six MCPs containing the PAS domain in V. 
cholerae El Tor C6706, namely aer2, aer3, aer4, aer5, aer6, and aer7. Deletion 
analyses of each aer homolog gene indicated that these Aer receptors are 
involved in aerotaxis, chemotaxis, biofilm formation, and intestinal 
colonization. Swarming motility assay indicated that the aer2 gene was 
responsible for sensing the oxygen gradient independent of the other five 
homologs. When bile salts and mucin were used as chemoattractants, each Aer 
receptor influenced the chemotaxis differently. Biofilm formation was enhanced 
by overexpression of the aer6 and aer7 genes. Moreover, deletion of the aer2 
gene resulted in better bacterial colonization of the mutant in adult mice; 
however, virulence gene expression was unaffected. These data suggest distinct 
roles for different Aer homologs in V. cholerae physiology."
1742,"Genome sequences of the monkeypox virus (MPXV) causing the current outbreak are 
being reported from an increasing number of countries. We present a 
letter-to-numerical sequence study via GenomeBits signal mapping in order to 
characterize the evolution of the MPXV via simple statistical analysis. 
Histograms, empirical and theoretical cumulative distribution curves and the 
resulting scatter plots for the base nucleotides A and C versus their 
complementary base nucleotides T and G are discussed. GenomeBits may help the 
surveillance of emergent infectious diseases."
1743,"The tremendous evolution of genome-editing tools in the last two decades has 
provided innovative and effective approaches for gene therapy of congenital and 
acquired diseases. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator- like 
effector nucleases (TALENs) and CRISPR-Cas9 have been already applied by ex vivo 
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy in genetic diseases (i.e., 
Hemoglobinopathies, Fanconi anemia and hereditary Immunodeficiencies) as well as 
infectious diseases (i.e., HIV), and the recent development of CRISPR-Cas9-based 
systems using base and prime editors as well as epigenome editors has provided 
safer tools for gene therapy. The ex vivo approach for gene addition or editing 
of HSCs, however, is complex, invasive, technically challenging, costly and not 
free of toxicity. In vivo gene addition or editing promise to transform gene 
therapy from a highly sophisticated strategy to a ""user-friendly' approach to 
eventually become a broadly available, highly accessible and potentially 
affordable treatment modality. In the present review article, based on the 
lessons gained by more than 3 decades of ex vivo HSC gene therapy, we discuss 
the concept, the tools, the progress made and the challenges to clinical 
translation of in vivo HSC gene editing."
1744,"The salmon family is one of the most iconic and economically important fish 
families, primarily possessing meat of excellent taste as well as irreplaceable 
nutritional and biological value. One of the most common and, therefore, highly 
significant members of this family, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), was 
not without reason one of the first fish species for which a high-quality 
reference genome assembly was produced and published. Genomic advancements are 
becoming increasingly essential in both the genetic enhancement of farmed salmon 
and the conservation of wild salmon stocks. The salmon genome has also played a 
significant role in influencing our comprehension of the evolutionary and 
functional ramifications of the ancestral whole-genome duplication event shared 
by all Salmonidae species. Here we provide an overview of the current state of 
research on the genomics and phylogeny of the various most studied subfamilies, 
genera, and individual salmonid species, focusing on those studies that aim to 
advance our understanding of salmonid ecology, physiology, and evolution, 
particularly for the purpose of improving aquaculture production. This review 
should make potential researchers pay attention to the current state of research 
on the salmonid genome, which should potentially attract interest in this 
important problem, and hence the application of new technologies (such as genome 
editing) in uncovering the genetic and evolutionary features of salmoniforms 
that underlie functional variation in traits of commercial and scientific 
importance."
1745,"Understanding the striking diversity of the angiosperms is a paramount issue in 
biology and of interest to biologists. The Millettiod legumes is one of the most 
hyper-diverse groups of the legume family, containing many economically 
important medicine, furniture and craft species. In the present study, we 
explore how the interplay of past climate change, ecological opportunities and 
functional traits' evolution may have triggered diversification of the 
Millettiod legumes. Using a comprehensive species-level phylogeny from three 
plastid markers, we estimate divergence times, infer habit shifts, test the 
phylogenetic and temporal diversification heterogeneity, and reconstruct 
ancestral biogeographical ranges. We found that three dramatic accumulations of 
the Millettiod legumes occurred during the Miocene. The rapid diversification of 
the Millettiod legumes in the Miocene was driven by ecological opportunities 
created by the emergence of new niches and range expansion. Additionally, habit 
shifts and the switch between biomes might have facilitated the rapid 
diversification of the Millettiod legumes. The Millettiod legumes provide an 
excellent case for supporting the idea that the interplay of functional traits, 
biomes, and climatic and geographic factors drives evolutionary success."
1746,"The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of tributyrin 
supplementation on liver fat metabolism in broiler chickens. Two hundred and 
forty broilers were randomly allocated into two experimental groups (6 
replicates per treatment; 20 chickens in each replicate): the control group 
(CN), which received a basal diet, and the tributyrin group (TB), which received 
a basal diet supplemented with 1 g/kg of tributyrin. The experimental period 
lasted 37 days. The results showed that in the liver, broilers supplemented with 
tributyrin had higher content of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (p 
&lt; 0.05). Liver hepatic lipase (HL), lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and total lipid 
(TL) activity were significantly lower than in the TB group than that in the NC 
group. Meanwhile, the diet supplemented with tributyrin had more lipid droplets 
than the NC group, whereas the TB and NC groups showed no histological 
abnormalities in the liver. Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of 
peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor α (PPARα), proliferators-activated 
receptor γ (PPARγ), fatty acid synthase (FAS), LPL and adipose triglyceride 
lipase (ATGL) in the liver were significantly upregulated in the TB group (p 
&lt; 0.05), while those of the long-chain acyl-CoA-synthetase 1 (ACSL1) mRNA 
between the TB group and the NC group were not different (p &gt; 0.05). These 
findings indicated that the diet supplemented with tributyrin could increase fat 
deposition appropriately by promoting fat synthesis without causing liver tissue 
damage, which demonstrated that tributyrin can be considered a valid feed 
additive for broiler chickens."
1747,"Neurological phenotypes such as intellectual disability occur in almost half of 
patients with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). Current genotype-phenotype studies have 
failed to reveal the mechanism underlying this clinical variability. Despite the 
presence of pathogenic variants of NF1, modifier genes likely determine the 
occurrence and severity of neurological phenotypes. Exome sequencing data were 
used to identify genetic variants in 13 NF1 patients and 457 healthy controls, 
and this information was used to identify candidate modifier genes underlying 
neurological phenotypes based on an optimal sequence kernel association test. 
Thirty-six genes were identified as significant modifying factors in patients 
with neurological phenotypes and all are highly expressed in the nervous system. 
A review of the literature confirmed that 19 genes including CUL7, DPH1, and 
BCO1 are clearly associated with the alteration of neurological functioning and 
development. Our study revealed the enrichment of rare variants of 19 genes 
closely related to neurological development and functioning in NF1 patients with 
neurological phenotypes, indicating possible modifier genes and variants 
affecting neurodevelopment. Further studies on rare genetic variants of 
candidate modifier genes may help explain the clinical heterogeneity of NF1."
1748,"Vernalization is the process of exposure to low temperatures, which is crucial 
for the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth of plants. In this 
study, the global landscape vernalization-related mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) were identified in Beta vulgaris. A total of 22,159 differentially 
expressed mRNAs and 4418 differentially expressed lncRNAs were uncovered between 
the vernalized and nonvernalized samples. Various regulatory proteins, such as 
zinc finger CCCH domain-containing proteins, F-box proteins, 
flowering-time-related proteins FY and FPA, PHD finger protein EHD3 and B3 
domain proteins were identified. Intriguingly, a novel vernalization-related 
lncRNA-mRNA target-gene co-expression regulatory network and the candidate 
vernalization genes, VRN1, VRN1-like, VAL1 and VAL2, encoding B3 
domain-containing proteins were also unveiled. The results of this study pave 
the way for further illumination of the molecular mechanisms underlying the 
vernalization of B. vulgaris."
1749,"The leaf angle is an important factor determining plant shoot architecture that 
may boost crop yield by increasing photosynthetic efficiency and facilitating 
high-density planting. Auxin is an important phytohormone involved in leaf angle 
regulation. Here, we identified two Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
the Indoleacetic Acid (IAA) glucosyltransferase gene CsIAGLU in 80 re-sequenced 
cucumber lines, of which the CsIAGLU717G,1234T is the dominant allele associated 
with a small leaf pedicle angle (LPA), whereas CsIAGLU717C,1234A is linked with 
a large LPA. CsIAGLU was highly expressed in leaves and petioles. In natural 
cucumber populations, the expression of CsIAGLU was negatively correlated with 
the LPA. The mutation of CsIAGLU induced by the CRISPR-Cas9 system resulted in 
elevated free IAA levels and enlarged cell expansion on the adaxial side of the 
petiole base, thus producing a greater LPA. Consistently, exogenous IAA 
treatment led to increased LPA and cell size. Therefore, our findings suggest 
that CsIAGLU functions as a negative regulator of LPA development via 
auxin-mediated cell expansion in cucumber, providing a valuable strategy for 
cucumber breeding with small LPAs."
1750,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. 
CRC recurrence and metastasis cause poor prognosis. ANGPTLs (angiopoietin-like 
proteins) are a family of proteins that are widely involved in metabolic disease 
and tumorigenesis. The roles of ANGPTLs in CRC are still controversial and 
deserve further research. In this study, several databases were employed to 
explore the expression profiles, prognostic values, genetic alterations, 
potential biological function, and immune infiltration correlation of ANGPTLs in 
CRC. The expression of ANGPTL4 was significantly positively correlated with the 
stage of CRC. Therefore, cell and molecular experiments were further performed 
to explore the roles of ANGPTL4. Our results showed that the transcriptions of 
ANGPTLs in colon cancer and rectal cancer tissues were lower than those in 
normal tissues, but the protein expression varied among different ANGPTLs. In 
addition, the high expression of ANGPTLs led to a relatively poor oncological 
outcome. Specifically, the expression of ANGPTL4 is significantly positively 
correlated with the stage of CRC. Further investigation revealed that ANGPTLs 
are mainly involved in signal transduction and the regulation of transcription, 
while KEGG pathway analyses demonstrated pathways in cancer. Additionally, we 
also observed that ANGPTL4 could promote the proliferation and migration of CRC 
cells, and four specific small molecule compounds had potential ANGPTL4-binding 
capabilities, suggesting the clinical application of these small molecule 
compounds on CRC treatment. Our findings imply the prognostic values and 
potential therapeutic targets of ANGPTLs in CRC."
1751,"BACKGROUND: One of the most frequent malignancies of the digestive system is 
stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). Recent research has demonstrated how cuproptosis 
(copper-dependent cell death) differs from other cell death mechanisms that were 
previously understood. Cuproptosis regulation in tumor cells could be a 
brand-new treatment strategy. Our goal was to create a cuproptosis-related 
lncRNA signature. Additionally, in order to evaluate the possible 
immunotherapeutic advantages and drug sensitivity, we attempted to study the 
association between these lncRNAs and the tumor immune microenvironment of STAD 
tumors.
METHODS: The TCGA database was accessed to download the RNA sequencing data, 
genetic mutations, and clinical profiles for TCGA STAD. To locate lncRNAs 
related to cuproptosis and build risk-prognosis models, three techniques were 
used: co-expression network analysis, Cox-regression techniques, and LASSO 
techniques. Additionally, an integrated methodology was used to validate the 
models' predictive capabilities. Then, using GO and KEGG analysis, we discovered 
the variations in biological functions between each group. The link between the 
risk score and various medications for STAD treatment was estimated using the 
tumor mutational load (TMB) and tumor immune dysfunction and rejection (TIDE) 
scores.
RESULT: We gathered 22 genes linked to cuproptosis based on the prior 
literature. Six lncRNAs related to cuproptosis were used to create a prognostic 
marker (AC016394.2, AC023511.1, AC147067.2, AL590705.3, HAGLR, and LINC01094). 
After that, the patients were split into high-risk and low-risk groups. A 
statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two groups 
was visible in the survival curves. The risk score was demonstrated to be an 
independent factor affecting the prognosis by both univariate and multivariate 
Cox regression analysis. Different risk scores were substantially related to the 
various immunological states of STAD patients, as further evidenced by immune 
cell infiltration and ssGSEA analysis. The two groups had differing burdens of 
tumor mutations. In addition, immunotherapy was more effective for STAD patients 
in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group, and risk scores for STAD were 
substantially connected with medication sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: We discovered a marker for six cuproptosis-associated lncRNAs 
linked to STAD as prognostic predictors, which may be useful biomarkers for risk 
stratification, evaluation of possible immunotherapy, and assessment of 
treatment sensitivity for STAD."
1752,"E-cadherin, a CDH1 gene product, is a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion 
molecule playing a critical role in the establishment of epithelial 
architecture, maintenance of cell polarity, and differentiation. Germline 
pathogenic variants in the CDH1 gene are associated with hereditary diffuse 
gastric cancer (HDGC), and large rearrangements in the CDH1 gene are now being 
reported as well. Because CDH1 pathogenic variants could be associated with 
breast cancer (BC) susceptibility, CDH1 rearrangements could also impact it. The 
aim of our study is to identify rearrangements in the CDH1 gene in 148 BC cases 
with no BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants. To do so, a zoom-in CGH array, 
covering the exonic, intronic, and flanking regions of the CDH1 gene, was used 
to screen our cohort. Intron 2 of the CDH1 gene was specifically targeted 
because it is largely reported to include several regulatory regions. As 
results, we detected one large rearrangement causing a premature stop in exon 3 
of the CDH1 gene in a proband with a bilateral lobular breast carcinoma and a 
gastric carcinoma (GC). Two large rearrangements in the intron 2, a deletion and 
a duplication, were also reported only with BC cases without any familial 
history of GC. No germline rearrangements in the CDH1 coding region were 
detected in those families without GC and with a broad range of BC 
susceptibility. This study confirms the diversity of large rearrangements in the 
CDH1 gene. The rearrangements identified in intron 2 highlight the putative role 
of this intron in CDH1 regulation and alternative transcripts. Recurrent 
duplication copy number variations (CNV) are found in this region, and the 
deletion encompasses an alternative CDH1 transcript. Screening for large 
rearrangements in the CDH1 gene could be important for genetic testing of BC."
1753,"Single-cell sequencing (SCS) uses a single cell as the research material and 
involves three dimensions: genes, phenotypes and cell biological mechanisms. 
This type of research can locate target cells, analyze the dynamic changes in 
the target cells and the relationships between the cells, and pinpoint the 
molecular mechanism of cell formation. Currently, a common problem faced by 
animal husbandry scientists is how to apply existing science and technology to 
promote the production of high-quality livestock and poultry products and to 
breed livestock for disease resistance; this is also a bottleneck for the 
sustainable development of animal husbandry. In recent years, although SCS 
technology has been successfully applied in the fields of medicine and 
bioscience, its application in poultry science has been rarely reported. With 
the sustainable development of science and technology and the poultry industry, 
SCS technology has great potential in the application of poultry science (or 
animal husbandry). Therefore, it is necessary to review the innovation of SCS 
technology and its application in poultry science. This article summarizes the 
current main technical methods of SCS and its application in poultry, which can 
provide potential references for its future applications in precision breeding, 
disease prevention and control, immunity, and cell identification."
1754,"Numerous genes involved in male reproduction regulate testis development and 
spermatogenesis. In this study, the testis tissue transcriptome was used to 
identify candidate genes and key pathways associated with fecundity in sheep. 
Histological analysis of testis tissue using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) routine 
staining was performed for two sheep breeds. Overall, 466 differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between Hu sheep (HS) and Tibetan sheep 
(TS) through RNA sequencing technology (RNA-Seq), including 226 upregulated and 
240 downregulated genes. Functional analysis showed that several terms and 
pathways, such as ""protein digestion and absorption"", ""cAMP signaling pathway"", 
""focal adhesion"", and ""p53 signaling pathway"" were closely related to testis 
development and spermatogenesis. Several genes (including COL1A1, COL1A2, 
COL3A1, SOX9, BCL2, HDC, and GGT5) were significantly enriched in these terms 
and pathways and might affect the reproduction of sheep by regulating the 
migration of spermatogenic cells, apoptosis of spermatogenic cells, and 
secretion of sterol hormones via testicular interstitial cells. Our results 
provide a theoretical basis for better understanding the molecular mechanisms of 
reproduction in sheep."
1755,"As a relict plant, Taxus is used in a variety of medicinal ingredients, for 
instance to treat a variety of cancers. Taxus plants are difficult to 
distinguish from one another due to their similar morphology; indeed, some 
species of Taxus cytogenetic data still are unclear. Oligo-FISH can rapidly and 
efficiently provide insight into the genetic composition and karyotype. This is 
important for understanding the organization and evolution of chromosomes in 
Taxus species. We analysed five Taxus species using two oligonucleotide probes. 
(AG3T3)3 signals were distributed at the chromosome ends and the centromere of 
five species of Taxus. The 5S rDNA signal was displayed on two chromosomes of 
five species of Taxus. In addition to Taxus wallichiana var. mairei, 5S rDNA 
signals were found proximal in the remaining four species, which signals a 
difference in its location. The karyotype formula of Taxus wallichiana was 2n = 
2x = 24m, its karyotype asymmetry index was 55.56%, and its arm ratio was 
3.0087. Taxus × media's karyotype formula was 2n = 2x = 24m, its karyotype 
asymmetry index was 55.09%, and its arm ratio was 3.4198. The karyotype formula 
of Taxus yunnanensis was 2n = 2x = 24m, its karyotype asymmetry index was 
55.56%, and its arm ratio was 2.6402. The karyotype formula of Taxus cuspidate 
was 2n = 2x = 24m, its karyotype asymmetry index was 54.67%, its arm ratio was 
3.0135, and two chromosomes exhibited the 5S rDNA signal. The karyotype formula 
of T. wallichiana var. mairei was 2n= 2x = 22m + 2sm, its karyotype asymmetry 
index was 54.33%, and its arm ratio was 2.8716. Our results provide the 
karyotype analysis and physical genetic map of five species of Taxus, which 
contributes to providing molecular cytogenetics data for Taxus."
1756,"Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are associated with increased risk of tendinopathy 
and tendon rupture, which can occur well after cessation of treatment. We have 
previously reported that the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin (CPX) reduced 
proteoglycan synthesis in equine tendon explants. This study aimed to determine 
the effects of CPX on proteoglycan catabolism and whether any observed effects 
are reversible. Equine superficial digital flexor tendon explant cultures were 
treated for 4 days with 1, 10, 100 or 300 µg/mL CPX followed by 8 days without 
CPX. The loss of [35S]-labelled proteoglycans and chemical pool of aggrecan and 
versican was studied as well as the gene expression levels of matrix-degrading 
enzymes responsible for proteoglycan catabolism. CPX suppressed [35S]-labelled 
proteoglycan and total aggrecan loss from the explants, although not in a 
dose-dependent manner, which coincided with downregulation of mRNA expression of 
MMP-9, -13, ADAMTS-4, -5. The suppressed loss of proteoglycans was reversed upon 
removal of the fluoroquinolone with concurrent recovery of MMP and ADAMTS mRNA 
expression, and downregulated TIMP-2 and upregulated TIMP-1 expression. No 
changes in MMP-3 expression by CPX was observed at any stage. These findings 
suggest that CPX suppresses proteoglycan catabolism in tendon, and this is 
partially attributable to downregulation of matrix-degrading enzymes."
1757,"Recent accomplishments in genome sequencing techniques have resulted in vast and 
complex genomic data sets, which have been used to uncover the genetic 
correlates of not only strictly medical phenomena but also psychological 
characteristics such as personality traits. In this commentary, we call for the 
use of genomic data analysis to unlock the valuable field of the genetics of 
entrepreneurship. Understanding what makes an entrepreneur and what explains 
their success is paramount given the importance of entrepreneurship to 
individual, organizational, and societal growth and success. Most of the studies 
into the genetics of entrepreneurship have investigated familial entrepreneurial 
inclinations in the form of parent-offspring comparisons or twin studies. 
However, these do not offer a complete picture of the etiology of 
entrepreneurship. The use of big data analytics combined with the rapidly 
growing field of genetic mapping has the potential to offer a more complete 
picture of the etiology of entrepreneurship by allowing researchers to pinpoint 
precisely which genes and pathways underlie entrepreneurial behavior and 
success. We review the risks and opportunities which accompany this endeavor and 
make the case that, ultimately, prioritizing more research into the genetics of 
entrepreneurship has the potential to be of value to both science and society."
1758,"Chinese indigenous pig breeds have unique genetic characteristics and a rich 
diversity; however, effective breed identification methods have not yet been 
well established. In this study, a genotype file of 62,822 single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs), which were obtained from 1059 individuals of 18 Chinese 
indigenous pig breeds and 5 cosmopolitan breeds, were used to screen the 
discriminating SNPs for pig breed identification. After linkage disequilibrium 
(LD) pruning filtering, this study excluded 396 SNPs on non-constant chromosomes 
and retained 20.92~-27.84% of SNPs for each of the 18 autosomes, leaving a total 
of 14,823 SNPs. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed the largest 
differences between cosmopolitan and Chinese pig breeds (PC1 = 10.452%), while 
relatively small differences were found among the 18 indigenous pig breeds from 
the Yangtze River Delta region of China. Next, a random forest (RF) algorithm 
was used to filter these SNPs and obtain the optimal number of decision trees 
(ntree = 1000) using corresponding out-of-bag (OOB) error rates. By comparing 
two different SNP ranking methods in the RF analysis, the mean decreasing 
accuracy (MDA) and mean decreasing Gini index (MDG), the effects of panels with 
different numbers of SNPs on the assignment accuracy, and the statistics of SNP 
distribution on each chromosome in the panels, a panel of 1000 of the most 
breed-discriminative tagged SNPs were finally selected based on the MDA 
screening method. A high accuracy (&gt;99.3%) was obtained by the breed 
prediction of 318 samples in the RF test set; thus, a machine learning 
classification method was established for the multi-breed identification of 
Chinese indigenous pigs based on a low-density panel of SNPs."
1759,"Bipolaris sorokiniana is a fungal pathogen that infects wheat, barley, and other 
crops, causing spot blotch disease. The disease is most common in humid, warm, 
wheat-growing regions, with South Asia's Eastern Gangetic Plains serving as a 
hotspot. There is very little information known about its genetic variability, 
demography, and divergence period. The current work is the first to study the 
phylogeographic patterns of B. sorokiniana isolates obtained from various wheat 
and barley-growing regions throughout the world, with the goal of elucidating 
the demographic history and estimating divergence times. In this study, 162 ITS 
sequences, 18 GAPDH sequences, and 74 TEF-1α sequences from B. sorokiniana 
obtained from the GenBank, including 21 ITS sequences produced in this study, 
were used to analyse the phylogeographic pattern of distribution and evolution 
of B. sorokiniana infecting wheat and barley. The degrees of differentiation 
among B. sorokiniana sequences from eighteen countries imply the presence of a 
broad and geographically undifferentiated global population. The study provided 
forty haplotypes. The H_1 haplotype was identified to be the ancestral 
haplotype, followed by H_29 and H_27, with H_1 occupying a central position in 
the median-joining network and being shared by several populations from 
different continents. The phylogeographic patterns of species based on 
multi-gene analysis, as well as the predominance of a single haplotype, 
suggested that human-mediated dispersal may have played a significant role in 
shaping this pathogen's population. According to divergence time analysis, 
haplogroups began at the Plio/Pleistocene boundary."
1760,"Achieving accurate STR genotyping by using next-generation sequencing data has 
been challenging. To provide the forensic genetics community with a reliable 
open-access STR database, we conducted a comprehensive genotyping analysis of a 
set of STRs of broad forensic interest obtained from 1000 Genome populations. We 
analyzed 22 STR markers using files of the high-coverage dataset of Phase 3 of 
the 1000 Genomes Project. We used HipSTR to call genotypes from 2504 samples 
obtained from 26 populations. We were not able to detect the D21S11 marker. The 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis coupled with a comprehensive analysis of 
allele frequencies revealed that HipSTR was not able to identify longer alleles, 
which resulted in heterozygote deficiency. Nevertheless, AMOVA, a clustering 
analysis that uses STRUCTURE, and a Principal Coordinates Analysis showed a 
clear-cut separation between the four major ancestries sampled by the 1000 
Genomes Consortium. Except for larger Penta D and Penta E alleles, and two very 
small Penta D alleles (2.2 and 3.2) usually observed in African populations, our 
analyses revealed that allele frequencies and genotypes offered as an 
open-access database are consistent and reliable."
1761,"(1) Background: Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term disability. 
Walking dysfunction and paresis of the upper extremities occurs in more than 80% 
of people who have had a stroke. (2) Methods: We studied post-genomic markers in 
biosamples of muscle and brain tissue from animals that underwent intracerebral 
hematoma and recovered after 42 days. Our purpose was to understand the 
biological mechanisms associated with recovery from hemorrhagic stroke. We 
analyzed the peptides formed after trypsinolysis of samples by HPLC-MS, and the 
results were processed by bioinformatics methods, including the establishment of 
biochemical relationships (gene to gene) using topological omics databases such 
as Reactome and KEGG. (3) Results: In the pig brain, unique compounds were 
identified which are expressed during the recovery period after traumatic 
injury. These are molecular factors of activated microglia, and they contribute 
to the functional recovery of neurons and reduce instances of hematoma, edema, 
and oxidative stress. Complexes of the main binding factors of the neurotrophins 
involved in the differentiation and survival of nerve cells were found in 
muscles. (4) Conclusions: A network of gene interactions has been constructed 
for proteins involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission, in particular 
presynaptic vesicular and endocytic processes. The presence of transmitters and 
transporters associated with stimulation of NMDA receptors at neuromuscular 
junctions shows the relationship between upper motor neurons and neuromuscular 
junctions."
1762,"Alport syndrome (AS) is the most frequent monogenic inherited glomerulopathy and 
is also genetically and clinically heterogeneous. It is caused by semi-dominant 
pathogenic variants in the X-linked COL4A5 (NM_000495.5) gene or recessive 
variants in the COL4A3/COL4A4 (NM_000091.4/NM_000092.4) genes. The disease 
manifests in early childhood with persistent microhematuria and can progress to 
proteinuria and kidney failure in adolescence or early adulthood if left 
untreated. On biopsy, pathognomonic features include alternate thinning, 
thickening and lamellation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), in the 
presence of podocyte foot process effacement. Although previous studies indicate 
a prevalence of AS of about 1/50,000, a recent publication reported a predicted 
rate of pathogenic COL4A5 variants of 1/2320. We herewith present 98 patients 
(40 M/58 F) from 26 Greek families. We are selectively presenting the families 
segregating the X-linked form of AS with pathogenic variants in the COL4A5 gene. 
We found 21 different pathogenic variants, 12 novel: eight glycine and one 
proline substitutions in the collagenous domain, one cysteine substitution in 
the NC1 domain, two premature termination of translation codons, three splicing 
variants, one 5-bp insertion/frameshift variant, one indel-frameshift variant 
and four gross deletions. Notably, patients in six families we describe here and 
three families we reported previously, carried the COL4A5-p.G624D substitution, 
a founder defect encountered all over Europe which is hypomorphic with mostly 
milder symptomatology. Importantly, on several occasions, the correct genetic 
diagnosis reclassified patients as patients with AS, leading to termination of 
previous immunosuppressive/cyclosporine A therapy and a switch to angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). With the understanding that all 98 patients 
span a wide range of ages from infancy to late adulthood, 15 patients (11 M/4 F) 
reached kidney failure and 11 (10 M/1 F) received a transplant. The prospects of 
avoiding lengthy diagnostic investigations and erroneous medications, and the 
advantage of delaying kidney failure with very early administration of 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade, highlights the importance 
of timely documentation of AS by genetic diagnosis."
1763,"Eukaryotic genomes are replicated in spatiotemporal patterns that are 
stereotypical for individual genomes and developmental profiles. In the model 
system Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two primary mechanisms determine the 
preferential activation of replication origins during early S phase, thereby 
largely defining the consequent replication profiles of these cells. Both 
mechanisms are thought to act through specific recruitment of a rate-limiting 
initiation factor, Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK), to a subset of licensed 
replication origins. Fkh1/2 is responsible for stimulation of most early-firing 
origins, except for centromere (CEN)-proximal origins that recruit DDK via the 
kinetochore protein Ctf19, which is required for their early firing. The 
C-terminus of Dbf4 has been implicated in its recruitment to origins via both 
the Fkh1/2 and Ctf19 mechanisms. Here, we show that the Zn-finger motif within 
the C-terminus is specifically required for Dbf4 recruitment to CENs to 
stimulate CEN-proximal/Ctf19-dependent origins, whereas stimulation of origins 
via the Fkh1/2 pathway remains largely intact. These findings re-open the 
question of exactly how Fkh1/2 and DDK act together to stimulate replication 
origin initiation."
1764,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) participate in hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, which 
drives liver fibrosis initiation and progression. We aimed to identify novel 
hepatic fibrosis targets using miRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) of human primary 
HSCs. Surgically resected liver tissues were used to extract HSCs. Based on 
next-generation sequencing, miRNA-seq was performed on four pairs of HSCs before 
and after in vitro culture. Additionally, we compared our data with open access 
miRNA-seq data derived from fourteen cirrhotic and nine healthy liver tissues. 
Selected miRNAs associated with fibrosis were verified by quantitative real-time 
PCR. Target mRNAs of differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were predicted to 
construct co-expression networks. We identified 230 DEmiRNAs (118 upregulated 
and 112 downregulated) upon HSC activation. Of the 17 miRNAs with the most 
significant differences in expression, liver disease-related miRNAs included 
miR-758-3p, miR-493-5p, miR-409-3p, miR-31-5p, miR-1268a, and miR-381-3p, which 
might play roles in hepatic fibrosis. Moreover, let-7g-5p, miR-107, miR-122-5p, 
miR-127-3p, miR-139-5p, miR-148a-3p, miR-194-5p, miR-215-5p, miR-26a-5p, 
miR-340-5p, miR-451a, and miR-99a-5p were common between our data and the 
publicly available sequencing data. A co-expression network comprising 1891 
matched miRNA-mRNA pairs representing 138 DEmiRNAs and 1414 DEmRNAs was 
constructed. MiR-1268a and miR-665, possessing the richest target DEmRNAs, may 
be vital in HSC activation. The targeted genes were involved in collagen 
metabolism, extracellular matrix structural constituent, cytoskeletal protein 
binding, and cell adhesion. The miRNAs we identified may provide a basis and 
reference for the selection of diagnostic and therapeutic targets for hepatic 
fibrosis."
1765,"Clostridioides difficile is an obligate anaerobic pathogen among the most common 
causes of healthcare-associated infections. It poses a global threat due to the 
clinical outcomes of infection and resistance to antibiotics recommended by 
international guidelines for its eradication. In particular, C. difficile 
infection can lead to fulminant colitis associated with shock, hypotension, 
megacolon, and, in severe cases, death. It is therefore of the utmost urgency to 
fully characterize this pathogen and better understand its spread, in order to 
reduce infection rates and improve therapy success. This review aims to provide 
a state-of-the-art overview of the genetic variation of C. difficile, with 
particular regard to pathogenic genes and the correlation with clinical issues 
of its infection. We also summarize the current typing techniques and, based on 
them, the global distribution of the most common ribotypes. Finally, we discuss 
genomic surveillance actions and new genetic engineering strategies as future 
perspectives to make it less difficile."
1766,"The genus Galerita Fabricius, 1801 belongs to the tribe Galeritini of the family 
Carabidae. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome (GenBank: 
ON920164.1) of G. orientalis is newly sequenced, annotated, characterized, and 
composed of 37 typical genes, and one control region. Mitogenome is a circular 
DNA molecule of 16,137 bp with a 78.79% AT content. All 13 protein-coding genes 
are initiated using a typical ATN (Met) as the start codon, except for nad1, 
which has a TTG as the start codon, and are terminated using a typical TAN stop 
codon. Twenty-two tRNAs could fold into a typical cloverleaf structure, 
including trnS1-GCU, which lacks the DHU stem observed in other mitogenomes of 
the subfamily Harpalinae. Both rrnS and rrnL contain many helices. A conserved 
poly-T stretch (19 bp) and seven tandem repeats are observed in the control 
region, and a phylogenetic analysis indicated that the genus Galerita is an 
independent lineage. The complete mitogenome of G. orientalis will contribute to 
further studies on the molecular basis of the classification and phylogeny of 
Harpalinae, and even Carabidae."
1767,"Albinism is a genetic disorder, present worldwide, caused by mutations in genes 
affecting melanin production or transport in the skin, hair and eyes. To date, 
mutations in at least 20 different genes have been identified. Oculo-cutaneous 
Albinism type IV (OCA4) is the most frequent form in Asia but has been reported 
in all populations, including Europeans. Little is known about the 
genotype-phenotype correlation. We identified two main phenotypes via the 
analysis of 30 OCA4 patients with a molecularly proven diagnosis. The first, 
found in 20 patients, is clinically indistinguishable from the classical OCA1 
phenotype. The genotype-to-phenotype correlation suggests that this phenotype is 
associated with homozygous or compound heterozygous nonsense or deletion 
variants with frameshift leading to translation interruption in the SLC45A2 
gene. The second phenotype, found in 10 patients, is characterized by very mild 
hypopigmentation of the hair (light brown or even dark hair) and skin that is 
similar to the general population. In this group, visual acuity is variable, but 
it can be subnormal, foveal hypoplasia can be low grade or even normal, and 
nystagmus may be lacking. These mild to moderate phenotypes are associated with 
at least one missense mutation in SLC45A2."
1768,"Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and 17p13.3 microduplication share 
multiple clinical features such as muscle hypotonia, cleft palate, and growth 
impairment. This paper describes a patient who was first diagnosed with the 
duplication and a decade later also with FKBP14-kEDS. The latter was initially 
overlooked due to the pathogenic significance attributed to the duplication and 
to the fact that, at the time of the first diagnosis, this specific form of kEDS 
had yet to be discovered. The patient's progressive kyphoscoliosis and severe 
joint laxity were the clinical features that prompted the patient's physiatrist 
to reassess the genetic work-up. This extreme latency caused inaccurate 
management in the patient's follow-up program, which ultimately may have 
resulted in preventable clinical complications. This report underlines the 
importance of remaining up-to-date with patient status, reviewing old cases, and 
relying on specialist advice to reach a correct diagnosis."
1769,"F-box/LR (FBXL), Leucine-rich repeats in F-box proteins, belongs to the 
Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF) E3 ligase family. FBXL genes play important 
roles in plant growth, such as plant hormones, responses to environmental 
stress, and floral organ development. Here, a total of 518 FBXL genes were 
identified and analyzed in six plant species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 
AtFBXLs, VvFBXLs, and GrFBXLs were clustered into three subfamilies (Ⅰ-Ⅲ). Based 
on the composition of the F-box domain and carboxyl-terminal amino acid 
sequence, FBXL proteins were classified into three types (Type-A/-B/-C). 
Whole-genome duplication (WGD) along with tandem duplications and segmental 
contributed to the expansion of this gene family. The result indicates that four 
cotton species are also divided into three subfamilies. FBXLs in cotton were 
classified into three clades by phylogenetic and structural analyses. 
Furthermore, expression analyses indicated that the expression patterns of 
GhFBXLs in different cotton tissues were different. The highly expressed of 
GH_A07G2363 in 5-8 mm anthers, indicates that this gene might play a role in the 
reproductive process, providing candidate genes for future studies on cotton 
fertility materials. This study provides an original functional opinion and a 
useful interpretation of the FBXL protein family in cotton."
1770,"The genus Argopistes (Chrysomelidae: Alticini) is the only group of flea beetles 
specialized in plant hosts in the family Oleaceae. In southern Africa, 
Argopistes are often found feeding on African Wild Olive (Olea europaea subsp. 
cuspidata) and European cultivated olive (O. e. subsp. europaea), and heavy 
infestations can be devastating to mature trees and compromise the development 
of young trees. Despite their negative agricultural impact, African Argopistes 
are an understudied group for which no genetic data were available. We assessed 
the species diversity of olive flea beetles in the Western Cape province of 
South Africa, the largest olive-producing region in sub-Saharan Africa, by 
collecting adult specimens on wild and cultivated olive trees between 2015 and 
2017. Argopistes sexvittatus Bryant, 1922 (n = 289) dominated at all sampling 
sites, and Argopistes capensis Bryant, 1944 (n = 2) was found only once. 
Argopistes oleae Bryant, 1922, a third species previously reported in the 
region, was not found. The complete mitogenomes of one A. capensis and two A. 
sexvittatus (striped and black morphotypes) individuals were sequenced for 
phylogenetic reconstruction in the context of other 64 species. The two olive 
flea beetle species form a monophyletic clade with other Argopistes, supporting 
the hypothesis that the exclusive feeding habit on Oleaceae is an evolutionary 
adaptation in this genus."
1771,"Nonhomologous chromosome interactions take place in both somatic and meiotic 
cells. Prior to this study, we had discovered special contacts through the SYCP3 
(synaptonemal complex protein 3) filament between the short arms of 
nonhomologous acrocentrics at the pachytene stage in the Alay mole vole, and 
these contacts demonstrate several patterns from proximity to the complete 
fusion stage. Here, we investigated the nonhomologous chromosome contacts in 
meiotic prophase I. It turned out that such contacts do not introduce changes 
into the classic distribution of DNA double-strand breaks. It is noteworthy that 
not all meiotic contacts were localized in the H3k9me3-positive heterochromatic 
environment. Both in the mid zygotene and in the early-mid diplotene, three 
types of contacts (proximity, touching, and anchoring/tethering) were observed, 
whereas fusion seems to be characteristic only for pachytene. The number of 
contacts in the mid pachytene is significantly higher than that in the zygotene, 
and the distance between centromeres in nonhomologous contacts is also the 
smallest in mid pachytene for all types of contacts. Thus, this work provides a 
new insight into the behavior of meiotic contacts during prophase I and points 
to avenues of further research."
1772,"Currently a hot topic, genomic selection (GS) has consistently provided powerful 
support for breeding studies and achieved more comprehensive and reliable 
selection in animal and plant breeding. GS estimates the effects of all single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and thereby predicts the genomic estimation of 
breeding value (GEBV), accelerating breeding progress and overcoming the 
limitations of conventional breeding. The successful application of GS primarily 
depends on the accuracy of the GEBV. Adopting appropriate advanced algorithms to 
improve the accuracy of the GEBV is time-saving and efficient for breeders, and 
the available algorithms can be further improved in the big data era. In this 
study, we develop a new algorithm under the Bayesian Shrinkage Regression (BSR, 
which is called BayesA) framework, an improved expectation-maximization 
algorithm for BayesA (emBAI). The emBAI algorithm first corrects the polygenic 
and environmental noise and then calculates the GEBV by emBayesA. We conduct two 
simulation experiments and a real dataset analysis for flowering time-related 
Arabidopsis phenotypes to validate the new algorithm. Compared to established 
methods, emBAI is more powerful in terms of prediction accuracy, mean square 
error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) and correlation of prediction in simulation studies. 
In addition, emBAI performs well under the increasing genetic background. The 
analysis of the Arabidopsis real dataset further illustrates the benefits of 
emBAI for genomic prediction according to prediction accuracy, MSE, MAE and 
correlation of prediction. Furthermore, the new method shows the advantages of 
significant loci detection and effect coefficient estimation, which are 
confirmed by The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) gene bank. In 
conclusion, the emBAI algorithm provides powerful support for GS in 
high-dimensional genomic datasets."
1773,"SLC26A4 is one of the most common genes causing autosomal recessive 
non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). It has been reported to cause 
Pendred Syndrome (PDS) and DFNB4 which is deafness with enlarged vestibular 
aqueduct (EVA). However, mutated SLC26A4 is not conclusive for having either 
DFNB4 or PDS. Three unrelated Jordanian families consisting of eight affected 
individuals with congenital bilateral hearing loss (HL) participated in this 
study. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing were performed to investigate the 
underlying molecular etiology of HL. Further clinical investigations, including 
laboratory blood workup for the thyroid gland, CT scan for the temporal bone, 
and thyroid ultrasound were performed. Three disease-causing variants were 
identified in SLC26A4 in the three families, two of which were novel. Two 
families had a novel pathogenic homozygous splice-site accepter variant 
(c.165-1G&gt;C), while the third family had compound heterozygous pathogenic 
variants (c.1446G&gt;A; p.Trp482* and c.304G&gt;A; p.Gly102Arg). Our approach 
helped in redirecting the diagnosis of several affected members of three 
different families from non-syndromic HL to syndromic HL. Two of the affected 
individuals had typical PDS, one had DFNB4, while the rest had atypical PDS. Our 
work emphasized the intra- and inter-familial variability of SLC26A4-related 
phenotypes. In addition, we highlighted the variable phenotypic impact of 
SLC26A4 on tailoring a personalized healthcare management."
1774,"Heterozygous deletions at 19q12-q13.11 affecting TSHZ3, the teashirt zinc finger 
homeobox 3, have been associated with intellectual disability and behavioural 
issues, congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), and 
postnatal growth retardation in humans and mice. TSHZ3 encodes a transcription 
factor regulating the development of neurons but is ubiquitously expressed. 
Using exome sequencing, we identified a heterozygous frameshift variant 
c.119_120dup p.Pro41SerfsTer79 in TSHZ3 in a 7-year-old girl with intellectual 
disability, behavioural issues, pyelocaliceal dilatation, and mild urethral 
stenosis. The variant was present on the paternal TSHZ3 allele. The DNA from the 
father was not available for testing. This is the first report of a heterozygous 
point mutation in TSHZ3 causing the same phenotype as reported for monoallelic 
deletions in the same region. This confirms TSHZ3 as a novel disease gene for 
neurodevelopmental disorder in combination with behavioural issues and CAKUT."
1775,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders 
caused by enzyme deficiencies required for cortisol biosynthesis in the adrenal 
cortex. The majority of CAH are due to the deficiency of the 21-hydroxylase 
enzyme, while 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 deficiency accounts for 
less than five percent of all CAH cases. We report two Moroccan twins from a 
spontaneous triplet pregnancy. The 46,XY newborn exhibited a disorder of sexual 
differentiation (DSD) with hypo virilization, while the 46,XX newborn had normal 
female external genitalia. In the first week of life, they showed hyponatremia 
and primary adrenal insufficiency with a slight 17OHP elevation and increased 
DHEAS and renin levels. The aCGH-SNP analysis disclosed a 8.36 Mb long 
contiguous stretch of homozygosity (LCSH) on chromosome 1p13.2-p11.2 including 
the candidate HSD3B2 gene, a LCSH of 7.3 Mb on 14q31.1-q32.11, and a 7 Mb 
duplication on 10q22.3-q23.2. Clinical exome sequencing revealed the biallelic 
c.969T &gt; G (p.Asn323Lys) HSD3B2, likely pathogenic, variant in both of the 
affected twins. This case emphasizes the importance of a prompt molecular 
diagnosis performed through the combination of aCGH and clinical exome, both for 
establishment of correct therapy and for follow-up, as the newborns also carry a 
genomic rearrangement with possible clinical implications."
1776,"Chromatin-chromatin interactions and three-dimensional (3D) spatial structures 
are involved in transcriptional regulation and have a decisive role in DNA 
replication and repair. To understand how individual genes and their regulatory 
elements function within the larger genomic context, and how the genome reacts 
to environmental stimuli, the linear sequence information needs to be 
interpreted in three-dimensional space, which is still a challenging task. Here, 
we propose a novel, heuristic approach to represent Hi-C datasets by a 
whole-genomic pseudo-structure in 3D space. The baseline of our approach is the 
construction of a multigraph from genomic-sequence data and Hi-C interaction 
data, then applying a modified force-directed layout algorithm. The resulting 
layout is a pseudo-structure. While pseudo-structures are not based on direct 
observation and their details are inherent to settings, surprisingly, they 
demonstrate interesting, overall similarities of known genome structures of both 
barley and rice, namely, the Rabl and Rosette-like conformation. It has an 
exciting potential to be extended by additional omics data (RNA-seq, Chip-seq, 
etc.), allowing to visualize the dynamics of the pseudo-structures across 
various tissues or developmental stages. Furthermore, this novel method would 
make it possible to revisit most Hi-C data accumulated in the public domain in 
the last decade."
1777,"Interspecific hybridization often shows negative effects on hybrids. However, 
only a few multicellular species, limited to a handful of plants and animals, 
have shown partial genetic mechanisms by which hybridization leads to low 
fitness in hybrids. Here, to explore the outcome of combining the two genomes of 
a horse and donkey, we analyzed the whole-genome sequences from an Equus 
parent-offspring trio using Illumina platforms. We generated 41.39× and 46.21× 
coverage sequences for the horse and mule, respectively. For the donkey, a 
40.38× coverage sequence was generated and stored in our laboratory. 
Approximately 24.86 million alleles were discovered that varied from the 
reference genome. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were used as polymorphic 
markers for assigning alleles to their parental genomic inheritance. We 
identified 25,703 Mendelian inheritance error single nucleotide polymorphisms in 
the mule genome that were not inherited from the parents through Mendelian 
inheritance. A total of 555 de novo single nucleotide polymorphisms were also 
identified. The rate of de novo single nucleotide polymorphisms was 2.21 × 10-7 
in the mule from the Equus parent-offspring trio. This rate is obviously higher 
than the natural mutation rate for Equus, which is also consistent with the 
previous hypothesis that interracial crosses may have a high mutation rate. The 
genes associated with these single nucleotide polymorphisms are mainly involved 
in immune processes, DNA repair, and cancer processes. The results of the 
analysis of three genomes from an Equus parent-offspring trio improved our 
knowledge of the consequences of the integration of parental genomes in mules."
1778,"Tonsillectomy is one of the most common procedures performed in children, 
however there are currently no published studies evaluating tonsillectomy in 
children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). With this study, our goal was 
to investigate the indications, efficacy, and complications of tonsillectomy in 
a pediatric cohort of patients with 22q11DS. This is a retrospective chart 
review of patients in our 22q Center's repository. Inclusion criteria were a 
diagnosis of 22q11DS and a history of tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Data 
collected included: indications for tonsillectomy, preoperative and 
postoperative polysomnography (PSG) results, and surgical complications. In 
total, 33 patients were included. Most common indications for tonsillectomy were 
facilitation with speech surgery (n = 21) and sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB)/obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (n = 16). Average length of stay was 1.15 
days. Most patients (69%) had some degree of persistent OSA on postoperative 
PSG. Complications occurred in 18% of patients and included respiratory 
distress, hemorrhage, and hypocalcemia. This study demonstrates tonsillectomy 
was a commonly performed procedure in this cohort of patients with 22q11DS. 
These data highlight the potential need for close postoperative calcium and 
respiratory monitoring. The data were limited with respect to PSG outcomes, and 
future studies are needed to better characterize OSA outcomes and complications 
in this patient population."
1779,"Spastic paraplegia and psychomotor retardation with or without seizures (SPPRS, 
OMIM 616756) is a rare genetic disease caused by biallelic pathogenic variants 
in the HACE1 gene. Originally, these mutations have been reported to be 
implicated in tumor predisposition. Nonetheless, via whole exome sequencing in 
2015, HACE1 mutations were suggested to be the cause of a new autosomal 
recessive neurodevelopmental disorder, which is characterized by spasticity, 
muscular hypotonia, and intellectual disability. To date, 14 HACE1 pathogenic 
variants have been described; these variants have a loss-of-function effect that 
leads to clinical presentations with variable severities. However, gross 
deletions in the HACE1 gene have not yet been mentioned as a cause of spastic 
paraplegia. Here, we report a clinical case involving a 2-year-old male 
presenting with spasticity, mainly affecting the lower limbs, and developmental 
delay. Exome sequencing, chromosomal microarray analysis, and mRNA analysis were 
used to identify the causative gene. We revealed that the clinical findings were 
due to previously undescribed HACE1 biallelic deletions. We identified the 
deletion of exon 7: c.(534+1_535-1)_(617+1_618-1)del (NM_020771.4) and the gross 
deletion in the 6q16.3 locus, which affected the entire HACE1 gene: 
g.105018931_105337494del, (GRCh37). A comprehensive diagnostic approach for the 
patients with originally homozygous mutations in HACE1 is required since false 
homozygosity results are possible. More than 80% of the described mutations were 
reported to be homozygous. Initial hemizygosity is hard to detect by 
quantitative methods, and this may challenge molecular diagnostic identification 
in patients with spastic paraplegia."
1780,"Micro RNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized as important regulators that are 
indispensable for testicular development and spermatogenesis. miRNAs are 
endogenous transcriptomic elements and mainly regulate the gene expression at 
post-transcriptional levels; however, the key role of miRNA in bovine testicular 
growth is not clearly understood. Thus, supposing to unveil the transcriptomics 
expression changes in the developmental processes of bovine testes, we selected 
three immature calves and three sexually mature bulls of the local Wandong breed 
for testicular-tissue sample collection. The cDNA libraries of experimental 
animals were established for RNA-sequencing analysis. We detected the miRNA 
expression in testes by using high-throughput sequencing technology, and 
bioinformatics analysis followed. The differentially expressed (DE) data showed 
that 151 miRNAs linked genes were significantly DE between immature and mature 
bull testes. Further, in detail, 64 were significantly up-regulated and 87 were 
down-regulated in the immature vs. mature testes (p-value &lt; 0.05). Pathway 
analyses for miRNA-linked genes were performed and identified JAG2, BCL6, 
CFAP157, PHC2, TYRO3, SEPTIN6, and BSP3; these genes were involved in biological 
pathways such as TNF signaling, T cell receptor, PI3KAkt signaling, and 
functions affecting testes development and spermatogenesis. The DE miRNAs 
including MIR425, MIR98, MIR34C, MIR184, MIR18A, MIR136, MIR15A, MIR1388 and 
MIR210 were associated with cattle-bull sexual maturation and sperm production. 
RT-qPCR validation analysis showed a consistent correlation to the sequencing 
data findings. The current study provides a good framework for understanding the 
mechanism of miRNAs in the development of testes and spermatogenesis."
1781,"White sponge nevus (WSN) is a rare autosomal dominant disease with a family 
history, often caused by mutations of the keratin 4 (K4) and keratin 13 (K13) 
genes in patients. It is characterized by frequently occurred white corrugated 
folds in the bilateral buccal mucosa with soft texture. On histopathological 
examination, hyperkeratosis of epithelial cells, edema, and vacuolar changes in 
the spinous cells are observed in the lesions, despite a normal layer of basal 
cells. WSN should be differentiated from other oral white spot diseases, mainly 
oral lichen planus, oral candidiasis, oral white edema, and Heck's disease, to 
reduce misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. At present, there is no specific 
treatment method. The purpose of this study was to report the clinical data of 
four WSN patients of the same family with the K4 gene mutation. The occurrence 
of WSN in a pair of monozygotic twins with very similar clinical presentations 
was identified for the first time. The gene sequencing results showed that there 
was a heterozygous deletion (C. 438_440delCAA) in exon 1 of the K4 gene, 
resulting in an aspartic acid loss in both the proband and his father. Finally, 
the etiology, pathogenesis, pathological manifestations, clinical 
manifestations, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and related treatment methods 
are discussed to provide a reference for clinical treatment of the disease."
1782,"Several studies have demonstrated that curcumin can cause the regression of 
polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), while others have shown negative 
results. Wholistic turmeric (WT) containing curcumin and additional bioactive 
compounds may contribute to this effect. We performed a double-blinded, 
randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy of WT in FAP patients. Ten 
FAP patients were randomly assigned to receive either WT or placebo for 6 
months. Colonoscopies were performed at baseline and after 6 months. The polyp 
number and size, as well as the cumulative polyp burden, were assessed. No 
differences were noted between the groups in terms of changes from the 
baseline's polyp number, size, or burden. However, stratifying the data 
according to the right vs. left colon indicated a decrease in the median polyp 
number (from 5.5 to 1.5, p = 0.06) and polyp burden (from 24.25 mm to 11.5 mm, p 
= 0.028) in the left colon of the patients in the WT group. The adjusted left 
polyp number and burden in the WT arm were lower by 5.39 (p = 0.034) and 14.68 
mm (p = 0.059), respectively. Whether WT can be used to reduce the polyp burden 
of patients with predominantly left-sided polyps remains to be seen; thus, 
further larger prospective trials are required."
1783,"Homeostasis is achieved by balancing cell survival and death. In cancer cells, 
especially those carrying driver mutations, the processes and signals that 
promote apoptosis are inhibited, facilitating the survival and proliferation of 
these dysregulated cells. Apoptosis induction is an important mechanism 
underlying the therapeutic efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). However, the mechanisms by which EGFR-TKIs induce apoptosis have 
not been fully elucidated. A deeper understanding of the apoptotic pathways 
induced by EGFR-TKIs is essential for the developing novel strategies to 
overcome resistance to EGFR-TKIs or to enhance the initial efficacy through 
therapeutic synergistic combinations. Recently, therapeutic strategies targeting 
apoptosis have been developed for cancer. Here, we review the state of knowledge 
on EGFR-TKI-induced apoptotic pathways and discuss the therapeutic strategies 
for enhancing EGFR-TKI efficiency. We highlight the great progress achieved with 
third-generation EGFR-TKIs. In particular, combination therapies of EGFR-TKIs 
with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor/receptor inhibitors or chemotherapy 
have emerged as promising therapeutic strategies for patients with EGFR-mutated 
NSCLC. Nevertheless, further breakthroughs are needed to yield an appropriate 
standard care for patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, which requires gaining a 
deeper understanding of cancer cell dynamics in response to EGFR-TKIs."
1784,"R-loops are DNA-RNA hybrids that play multifunctional roles in gene regulation, 
including replication, transcription, transcription-replication collision, 
epigenetics, and preserving the integrity of the genome. The aberrant formation 
and accumulation of unscheduled R-loops can disrupt gene expression and damage 
DNA, thereby causing genome instability. Recent links between unscheduled R-loop 
accumulation and the abundance of proteins that modulate R-loop biogenesis have 
been associated with numerous human diseases, including various cancers. 
Although R-loops are not necessarily causative for all disease entities 
described to date, they can perpetuate and even exacerbate the initially 
disease-eliciting pathophysiology, making them structures of interest for 
molecular diagnostics. In this review, we discuss the (patho) physiological role 
of R-loops in health and disease, their surprising diagnostic potential, and 
state-of-the-art techniques for their detection."
1785,"Caladiums are promising colorful foliage plants due to their dazzling colors of 
the leaves, veins, stripes, and patches, which are often cultivated in pots or 
gardens as decorations. Four wild species, including C. bicolor, C. humboldtii, 
C. praetermissum, and C. lindenii, were employed in this study, where their 
chloroplast (cp) genomes were sequenced, assembled, and annotated via 
high-throughput sequencing. The whole cp genome size ranged from 162,776 bp to 
168,888 bp, and the GC contents ranged from 35.09% to 35.91%. Compared with the 
single large copy (LSC) and single small copy (SSC) regions, more conserved 
sequences were identified in the inverted repeat regions (IR). We further 
analyzed the different region borders of nine species of Araceae and found the 
expansion or contraction of IR/SSC regions might account for the cp genome size 
variation. Totally, 131 genes were annotated in the cp genomes, including 86 
protein-coding genes (PCGs), 37 tRNAs, and eight rRNAs. The effective number of 
codons (ENC) values and neutrality plot analyses provided the foundation that 
the natural selection pressure could greatly affect the codon preference. The 
GC3 content was significantly lower than that of GC1 and GC2, and codons ending 
with A/U had higher usage preferences. Finally, we conducted phylogenetic 
relationship analysis based on the chloroplast genomes of twelve species of 
Araceae, in which C. bicolor and C. humboldtii were grouped together, and C. 
lindenii was furthest from the other three Caladium species occupying a separate 
branch. These results will provide a basis for the identification, development, 
and utilization of Caladium germplasm."
1786,"Gout is caused by elevated serum urate leading to the deposition of monosodium 
urate (MSU) crystals that can trigger episodes of acute inflammation. Humans are 
sensitive to developing gout because they lack a functional urate-metabolizing 
enzyme called uricase/urate oxidase (encoded by the UOX gene). A hallmark of 
long-standing disease is tophaceous gout, characterized by the formation of 
tissue-damaging granuloma-like structures ('tophi') composed of densely packed 
MSU crystals and immune cells. Little is known about how tophi form, largely due 
to the lack of suitable animal models in which the host response to MSU crystals 
can be studied in vivo long-term. We have previously described a larval 
zebrafish model of acute gouty inflammation where the host response to 
microinjected MSU crystals can be live imaged within an intact animal. Although 
useful for modeling acute inflammation, crystals are rapidly cleared following a 
robust innate immune response, precluding analysis at later stages. Here we 
describe a zebrafish uox null mutant that possesses elevated urate levels at 
larval stages. Uricase-deficient 'hyperuricemic' larvae exhibit a suppressed 
acute inflammatory response to MSU crystals and prolonged in vivo crystal 
persistence. Imaging of crystals at later stages reveals that they form 
granuloma-like structures dominated by macrophages. We believe that uox-/- 
larvae will provide a useful tool to explore the transition from acute gouty 
inflammation to tophus formation, one of the remaining mysteries of gout 
pathogenesis."
1787,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used as an effective tool to 
understand the genetics of complex traits such as gastrointestinal parasite 
(GIP) resistance. The aim of this study was to understand the genetics of 
gastrointestinal parasite (nematodes, Moniezia spp., Eimeria spp.) resistance in 
Akkaraman sheep by performing genomic heritability estimations and conducting 
GWAS to uncover responsible genomic regions. This is one of the first studies to 
examine the genetic resistance of Akkaraman sheep to the tapeworm parasite. The 
samples from 475 animals were genotyped using the Axiom 50K Ovine Genotyping 
Array. Genomic heritability estimates ranged from 0.00 to 0.34 for parasite 
resistance traits. This indicates that measured phenotypes have low to moderate 
heritability estimates. A total of two genome-wide significant SNP associated 
with TNEM3 and ATRNL1 genes and 10 chromosome-wide significant SNPs related with 
10 genes namely NELL1, ST6GALNAC3, HIPK1, SYT1, ALK, ZNF596, TMCO5A, PTH2R, 
LARGE1, and SCG2 were suggested as candidates for parasite resistance traits. 
The majority of these candidate genes were involved in several basic biological 
processes that are essential and important for immune system functions and 
cellular growth; specifically, inflammatory responses, cellular transport, cell 
apoptosis, cell differentiation, histone de-acetylation, and endocytosis. These 
results have implications for animal breeding program studies due to the effect 
that the genetic background has on parasite resistance, which underlies many 
productive, health, and wellness-related traits."
1788,"Fluoroquinolones are a widely used class of chemotherapeutics within veterinary 
medicine, prized for their broad-spectrum bactericidal activity. These drugs 
present a known risk of retinal phototoxicity in domestic cats (Felis catus); 
therefore, using lower doses and alternative antibiotic classes is encouraged in 
this species. This adverse drug effect of fluoroquinolones, and enrofloxacin 
specifically, has been determined to be species-specific in domestic felids. 
Four feline-specific missense variants in ABCG2 result in four amino acid 
changes (E159M, S279L, H283Q, and T644I) that are unique to the domestic cat 
compared with multiple other nonfeline mammalian species. These changes alter 
the ABCG2 protein involved with the cellular transmembrane transport of drugs, 
including fluoroquinolones, making the protein functionally defective in 
domestic cats. The predisposition to fluoroquinolone-mediated phototoxicity in 
nondomestic felids was explored in this study. At least eight nondomestic felids 
share the four ABCG2 missense variants with domestic cats, and eleven other 
felids shared at least three of the four domestic cat variants. Taken together, 
these results suggest the genetic potential for nondomestic felids to also 
experience fluoroquinolone-induced retinal phototoxicity; therefore, cautions 
similar to those for domestic cats should be followed for these drugs in the 
entire feline taxon."
1789,"Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) has 
been shown in adults to minimize nerve palsy after thyroid surgery, but only few 
studies on its efficacy in a pediatric population have been reported. We 
conducted a retrospective study on patients operated for thyroid lesions from 
2016 to 2022. The analyzed population was divided in two groups: patients 
treated from 2016 to 2020, when the identification of the RLN was performed 
without IONM (Group A); and patients treated since 2021, when IONM was 
implemented in every surgical procedure on the thyroid (Group B). Intraoperative 
Neurophysiological Monitoring was performed by using corticobulbar motor-evoked 
potentials and continuous electromyography. Twentyfive children underwent 
thyroid resection, 19 (76%) of which due to thyroid carcinoma. Each patient's 
recurrent nerve was identified; IONM was used in 13 patients. In Group A, one 
temporary nerve palsy was identified postoperatively (8.3%), while in group B 
one nerve dysfunction occurred (7.7%). No statistically significant difference 
was found between the two groups in terms of post-operative RLN palsy. No 
surgical complication due to the use of IONM was reported. In children and 
teenagers, intraoperative neuromonitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is a 
safe and accurate method, minimizing the risk of nerve damage."
1790,"Previous studies have suggested that the ACTL6B monoallelic variant is 
responsible for an autosomal dominant inherited intellectual developmental 
disorder with severe speech and ambulation deficits. The clinical phenotype of 
developmental and epileptic encephalopathy type 76 (DEE76) due to ACTL6B 
biallelic variants was first reported in 2019, with an autosomal recessive mode 
of inheritance. In this paper, we report on a child in China with DEE76 caused 
by a compound heterozygous variant of the ACTL6B gene, and we review the 
literature on ACTL6B gene variants causing DEE76 with complete clinical 
information. Including our case 1, the genotype and phenotypic characteristics 
of 18 children from 14 families are summarized. All 18 cases are autosomal 
recessive, including 12 with homozygous variants and six with compound 
heterozygous variants. A total of 17 variants have been reported so far, 
including 14 variants of the loss function. We summarize the clinical features 
using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. We find that DEE76, caused by the 
ACTL6B biallelic variant, is an early-onset drug-refractory epilepsy with global 
developmental delayHP:0001263, hypertoniaHP:0001276, and microcephalyHP:0000252, 
and imaging is characterized by brain delayed myelinationHP:0012448. Our case of 
DEE76 had not been reported when the patient underwent genetic testing in 2018, 
and the diagnosis was clarified by the reanalysis of the data 2 years later, 
being the first reported Chinese patient and the only one in which the 
application of a ketogenic diet for antiepileptic treatment may have been 
effective."
1791,"Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) is a rare genetic condition by 
mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) gene resulting in target issue 
resistance to androgens and a female phenotype in genetically male individuals. 
A 16-year-old phenotypically female individual presented to our clinic with 
primary amenorrhea. Her clinical evaluation showed normal female external 
genitalia, Tanner III breast development and sparse pubic and axillary hair 
(Tanner stage II). Hormonal assessment revealed increased concentrations of 
Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Testosterone and Antimüllerian Hormone (AMH). Image 
studies detected no uterus or gonads, but a blind vagina and the karyotype was 
46, XY. These findings suggested the diagnosis of CAIS, and genetic testing of 
the AR gene revealed a rare pathogenic mutation of cytosine to adenine 
(c.2612C&gt;A) replacing alanine with glutamic acid at position 871 
(p.Ala871Glu) in the AR, previously described once in two adult sisters. The 
patient underwent gonadectomy and received hormonal replacement therapy. This 
study expands the AR mutation database and shows the complexity and the 
importance of prompt diagnosis, proper management, and follow-up for CAIS 
patients, underlining the need for standardized protocols."
1792,"Inflammation and infection play an important role in the pathophysiology of 
cystic fibrosis, and they are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in 
CF. The presence of thick mucus in the CF airways predisposes to local hypoxia 
and promotes infection and inflammation. A vicious cycle of airway obstruction, 
inflammation, and infection is of critical importance for the progression of the 
disease, and new data elucidate the different factors that influence it. Recent 
research has been focused on improving infection and inflammation in addition to 
correcting the basic gene defect. This review aims to summarize important 
advances in infection and inflammation as well as the effect of new treatments 
modulating the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) 
protein. New approaches to target infection and inflammation are being studied, 
including gallium, nitric oxide, and phage therapy for infection, along with 
retinoids and neutrophil elastase inhibitors for inflammation."
1793,"BACKGROUND: MCPH1 is known as the microcephalin gene (OMIM: *607117), of which 
the encoding protein is a basic regulator of chromosome condensation (BCRT-BRCA1 
C-terminus). The microcephalin protein is made up of three BCRT domains and 
conserved tandem repeats of interacting phospho-peptides. There is a strong 
connection between mutations of the MCPH1 gene and reduced brain growth. 
Specifically, individuals with such mutations have underdeveloped brains, 
varying levels of mental retardation, delayed speech and poor language skills.
METHODS: In this article, a family with two affected fetuses presenting a 
mutation of the MCPH1 gene is reported. During the first trimester ultrasound of 
the second pregnancy, the measure of nuchal translucency was increased (NT = 3.1 
mm) and, therefore, the risk for chromosomal abnormalities was high. Chorionic 
villi sampling (CVS) was then performed. Afterwards, fetal karyotyping and Next 
Generation Sequencing were carried out. Afterwards, NGS was also performed in a 
preserved sample of the first fetus which was terminated due to microcephaly.
RESULTS: In this case, the fetuses had a novel homozygous mutation of the MCPH1 
gene (c.348del). Their parents were heterozygous for the mutation. The fetuses 
showed severe microcephaly. Because of the splice sites in introns, this 
mutation causes the forming of dysfunctional proteins which lack crucial domains 
of the C-terminus.
CONCLUSION: Our findings portray an association between the new MCPH1 mutation 
(c.348del) and the clinical features of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly 
(MCPH), contributing to a broader spectrum related to these pathologies. To our 
knowledge, this is the first prenatal diagnosis of MCPH due to a novel MCPH1 
mutation."
1794,"Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is an inherited disease caused by mutation of the 
alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) gene in an autosomal dominant or an autosomal 
recessive manner. The main symptoms of HPP are bone hypomineralization and early 
exfoliation of the primary teeth. Some of the mutations identified in autosomal 
dominant families are reported to have dominant negative effects. In addition, 
the penetrance can vary among patients with the same variant even within the 
same family, resulting in various phenotypes of systemic symptoms. However, 
differences in dental symptoms between patients with HPP and carriers with the 
same ALPL variant have not been reported. Herein, we report on two sisters who 
had the same heterozygous ALPL variant with dominant negative effects. The older 
sister had bone and dental symptoms and was diagnosed with childhood HPP. In 
contrast, the younger sister was a carrier with no bone and dental symptoms. It 
can be inferred that this phenomenon was caused by the difference in penetrance. 
This case revealed that carriers with the ALPL mutation may have no dental 
symptoms characteristic of HPP. Because HPP is sometimes progressive, it is very 
important to carefully monitor carriers to detect the possible onset of dental 
and systemic symptoms."
1795,"The aim of this study was to assess the psychosocial burden in parents of 
children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), detected by newborn screening 
(NBS), for which first pilot projects started in January 2018 in Germany. The 
survey, performed 1-2 years after children's diagnosis of SMA via NBS, included 
3 parent-related questionnaires to evaluate the psychosocial burden, quality of 
life (QoL)/satisfaction and work productivity and activity impairment in the 
families. 42/44 families, detected between January 2018 and February 2020, could 
be investigated. Interestingly, statistical analysis revealed a significant 
difference between families with children that received SMN-targeted therapy vs. 
children with a wait-and-see strategy as to social burden (p = 0.016) and 
personal strain/worries about the future (p = 0.02). However, the evaluation of 
QoL showed no significant differences between treated vs. untreated children. 
Fathers of treated children felt more negative impact regarding their 
productivities at work (p = 0.005) and more negative effects on daily activities 
(p = 0.022) than fathers of untreated children. Thus, NBS in SMA has a 
psychosocial impact on families, not only in terms of diagnosis but especially 
in terms of treatment, and triggers concerns about the future, emphasizing the 
need for comprehensive multidisciplinary care. Understanding the parents' 
perspective allows genetic counselors and NBS programs to proactively develop a 
care plan for parents during the challenging time of uncertainty, anxiety, 
frustration, and fear of the unknown."
1796,"Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive lipid storage 
disorder. There are two types, NPC1, which is the predominant form (95%), and 
the rare NPC2, which represents less than 5% of the reported cases. Niemann-Pick 
disease type C2 usually presents with respiratory symptoms, cholestasis, 
neurological impairment, and hepatosplenomegaly. Case report: Here, we report a 
3-year-old boy who presented to our hospital with exacerbation of chronic lung 
disease requiring invasive ventilatory support. He was previously diagnosed with 
interstitial lung disease. His parents used to instill olive oil in his nose (a 
few drops in each nostril daily for several months) to treat frequent nasal 
bleeding. A detailed history revealed prolonged neonatal jaundice for four 
months, with hepatosplenomegaly. In his second year, generalized hypotonia and 
delayed psychomotor development were observed. Upon presentation to our 
institute, chest CT showed evidence of intraparenchymal fat; therefore, lipoid 
pneumonia and lipid storage disease were suspected. The bronchoalveolar lavage 
results suggested pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). Whole-exome sequencing 
(WES) revealed a class one homozygous pathogenic variant in the NPC2 gene. Our 
patient faced a range of difficulties, including prolonged mechanical 
ventilation and diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Conclusion: Niemann-Pick 
disease type C2 is a progressive and lethal condition that requires a high index 
of suspicion to pinpoint the diagnosis. Gene study remains the method of choice 
to confirm the diagnosis. There are limited choices of therapeutic 
interventions; therefore, genetic counseling and the prevention of recurrence 
should be the ultimate goal for affected families."
1797,"CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a developmental encephalopathy caused by 
pathogenic variants in the X-linked cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDKL5) gene. This 
rare disorder occurs more frequently in females than in males. The incidence is 
estimated to be approximately 1: 40,000-60,000 live births. So far, 50 cases 
have been described in boys. The clinical course in males tends to be more 
severe and is often associated with death in the first or second decade of life. 
The authors present an unreported 2.5-year-old male patient with drug-resistant 
epilepsy who was diagnosed with a de novo mutation in the CDKL5 gene. First 
seizures developed in the fifth week of life and have progressed steadily since 
then. The child's psychomotor development was strongly delayed, and generalized 
hypotonia was noticed since birth. Brain MRI showed areas of incomplete 
myelination, posterior narrowing of the corpus callosum, a pineal cyst of up to 
3 mm, and open islet lids. Intensive antiseizure medications (ASMs), a ketogenic 
diet, and steroid therapy were not successful. Short-term improvement was 
achieved with the implantation of a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). Due to the 
progressive course of the disease, the boy requires frequent modification of 
ASMs."
1798,"Although the genetic origins underpinning congenital heart disease (CHD) have 
been extensively studied, genes, by themselves, do not entirely predict 
phenotypes, which result from the complex interplay between genes and the 
environment. Consequently, genes merely suggest the potential occurrence of a 
specific phenotype, but they cannot predict what will happen in reality. This 
task can be revealed by metabolomics, the most promising of the ""omics 
sciences"". Though metabolomics applied to CHD is still in its infant phase, it 
has already been applied to CHD prenatal diagnosis, as well as to predict 
outcomes after cardiac surgery. Particular metabolomic fingerprints have been 
identified for some of the specific CHD subtypes. The hallmarks of CHD-related 
pulmonary arterial hypertension have also been discovered. This review, which is 
presented in a narrative format, due to the heterogeneity of the selected 
papers, aims to provide the readers with a synopsis of the literature on 
metabolomics in the CHD setting."
1799,"Orthopedic and trauma device-related infections (ODRI) due to high virulence 
microorganisms are a devastating complication after orthopedic surgery. 
Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) are mainly involved but commensal 
bacteria, located in human mucous membranes, are emerging pathogens in ODRI. 
Currently, bacterial culture is the gold standard for ODRI but the diagnostic 
process remains time consuming and laborious. We evaluated a combination of 
microbiological approaches in the diagnosis of emerging pathogens involved in 
ODRI. We analyzed two synovial fluids, five tissue samples and five surgical 
wound swabs from two different patients with ODRI, attending the Department of 
Orthopedic and Trauma Surgery of Mater Domini Teaching Hospital, Catanzaro, 
Italy. Identification was carried out with a combination of microbiological 
approaches (culture, mass spectrometry and 16s rRNA gene sequencing). We 
demonstrated the importance of a combination of microbiological approaches for 
the diagnosis of emerging pathogens in ODRI, because the low number of cases in 
the literature makes it very difficult to formulate guidelines for the 
management of patients."
1800,"Neuroblastic tumors (NTs) represent the most common extracranial neoplasm 
occurring in childhood. Although ganglioneuroblastoma intermixed (GNBI) and 
ganglioneuroma (GN) are classified as very low-risk tumors, neuroblastoma (NB) 
and ganglioneuroblastoma-nodular (GNBN) may represent a serious risk to 
survival. Unfortunately, areas of GNBI and GNBN can coexist in the same mass, 
leading to incorrect risk staging when only biopsy is performed. Herein, we 
describe a case of multifocal NT (thoracic and abdominal localization) occurring 
in a 4-year-old male. Different histological subtypes, namely GNBI and GNBN, 
were revealed in the two lesions. We focus on the difficulties of proper 
diagnosis and risk stratification, underlining the usefulness of several 
diagnostic tools for appropriate management and therapeutic choices."
1801,"Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (LncRNAs) are recently known for their role in 
regulating gene expression and the development of cancer. Controversial results 
indicate a correlation between the tissue expression of LncRNA and LncRNA 
content of extracellular vesicles. The present study aimed to evaluate the 
expression of different LncRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients 
in tumor tissue, adjacent non-cancerous tissue (ANCT), and exosome-mediated 
lncRNA. Tumor and ANCT, as well as serum samples of 168 patient with NSCLC, were 
collected. The GHSROS, HNF1A-AS1, HOTAIR, HMlincRNA717, and LINCRNA-p21 relative 
expressions in tumor tissue, ANCT, and serum exosomes were evaluated in NSCLC 
patients. Among 168 NSCLC samples, the expressions of GHSROS (REx = 3.64, p = 
0.028), HNF1A-AS1 (REx = 2.97, p = 0.041), and HOTAIR (REx = 2.9, p = 0.0389) 
were upregulated, and the expressions of HMlincRNA717 (REx = -4.56, p = 0.0012) 
and LINCRNA-p21 (REx = -5.14, p = 0.00334) were downregulated in tumor tissue in 
contrast to ANCT. Moreover, similar statistical differences were seen in the 
exosome-derived RNA of tumor tissues in contrast to ANCT samples. A panel of the 
five lncRNAs demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) for exosome and 
tumor was 0.937 (standard error: 0.012, p value &lt; 0.0001). LncRNAs GHSROS, 
HNF1A-AS1, and HOTAIR showed high expression in tumor tissue and exosome content 
in NSCLC, and a panel that consisted of all five lncRNAs improved diagnosis of 
NSCLC."
1802,"Ameloblastoma is a rare benign epithelial odontogenic neoplasm, but with great 
clinical implications, as despite its benignity and slow growth, most cases are 
locally aggressive with a significant recurrence rate. Histological, cellular, 
or molecular analyses of its pathogenesis have confirmed the complexity of this 
neoplasm. We present the case of a 20-year-old patient with a suggestive 
clinical and radiographic diagnosis of ameloblastoma. An incisional biopsy was 
obtained confirming the diagnosis of conventional ameloblastoma. Left 
hemimandibulectomy and plate reconstruction were performed. Histopathological 
analysis of the surgical specimen confirmed the conventional ameloblastoma with 
a plexiform pattern and significant areas of cystic degeneration and 
amyloid-like-like deposits. Additionally, a microarray was carried out with 
bioinformatic analysis for the enrichment, protein interaction, and 
determination of eight hub genes (CRP, BCHE, APP, AKT1, AGT, ACTC1, ADAM10, and 
APOA2) related to their pathogenesis."
1803,"The investigation of unexplained global developmental delay (GDD)/intellectual 
disability (ID) is challenging. In low resource settings, patients may not 
follow a standardized diagnostic process that makes use of the benefits of 
advanced technologies. Our study aims to explore the contribution of chromosome 
microarray analysis (CMA) in identifying the genetic etiology of GDD/ID. A total 
of 371 Romanian patients with syndromic or non-syndromic GDD/ID, without 
epilepsy, were routinely evaluated in tertiary clinics. A total of 234 males 
(63.07%) and 137 (36.93%) females, with ages ranging from 6 months to 40 years 
(median age of 5.5 years), were referred for genetic diagnosis between 2015 and 
2022; testing options included CMA and/or karyotyping. Agilent Technologies and 
Oxford Gene Technology CMA workflows were used. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic 
copy number variations (pCNVs) were identified in 79 patients (21.29%). 
Diagnosis yield was comparable between mild ID (17.05%, 22/129) and 
moderate/severe ID 23.55% (57/242). Higher rates were found in cases where 
facial dysmorphism (22.97%, 71/309), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (19.11%, 
26/136) and finger anomalies (20%, 27/96) were associated with GDD/ID. GDD/ID 
plus multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) account for the highest detection rates 
at 27.42% (17/62). pCNVs represent a significant proportion of the genetic 
causes of GDD/ID. Our study confirms the utility of CMA in assessing GDD/ID with 
an uncertain etiology, especially in patients with associated comorbidities."
1804,"Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative 
disorder due to the homozygous pathological expansion of guanine-adenine-adenine 
(GAA) triplet repeats in the first intron of the FXN gene, which encodes for the 
mitochondrial protein frataxin. In the visual system, the typical manifestations 
are ocular motility abnormality, optic neuropathy, and retinopathy. Despite the 
evidence of ophthalmological impairment in FRDA patients, there is a lack of 
information about the morpho-functional condition of the retina and of the optic 
pathways in healthy heterozygous carriers of Friedreich's ataxia (C-FRDA). Ten 
C-FRDA subjects (providing 20 eyes) and thirty-five Controls (providing 70 eyes) 
underwent a complete neurological and ophthalmological examination comprehensive 
of functional (full-field Electroretinogram (ffERG), multifocal 
Electroretinogram (mfERG), Visual Evoked Potential (VEP), and Pattern Reversal 
Electroretinogram (PERG)) and morphological assessments (Optical Coherence 
Tomography, OCT) of the retina, macula, retinal ganglion cells, and visual 
pathways. The groups' data were compared using a two-sample t-test. Pearson's 
test was used to investigate the morpho-functional correlations. Statistically 
significant differences (p &lt; 0.01) between C-FRDA and Control eyes for the 
values of the following parameters were found: ffERG b-wave amplitude, mfERG 
Response Amplitude Densities, PERG P50 implicit time and P50-N95 amplitude, VEP 
P100 implicit time, Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) Overall, and Nasal 
thickness. The values of the OCT macular volume were not statistically different 
(p &gt; 0.01) between the two Groups. Therefore, our data suggest that, in 
C-FRDA, a dysfunction of retinal elements without morphological macular 
impairment may occur. In addition, a morphological impairment of RNFL associated 
with an abnormal neural conduction along the visual pathways can be also 
detected."
1805,"Thyroid carcinomas (TC) are rare in the pediatric population; however, they 
constitute the most common endocrine malignancy. Despite some similarities with 
adult carcinomas, they have distinct clinical behavior and responses to therapy 
due to their unique pathology and molecular characteristics. The age cut-off 
used for defining the pediatric age group has been variable across different 
studies, and the universally accepted recommendations influence accurate 
interpretation of the available data. Moreover, factors such as radiation 
exposure and germline mutations have greater impact in children than in adults. 
Papillary TC is the most common and the most evaluated pediatric TC. Others, 
including follicular, poorly differentiated and medullary carcinomas, are rarer 
and have limited available literature. Most studies are from the West. Asian 
studies are primarily from Japan, with few from China, India, Saudi Arabia and 
Republic of Korea. This review provides a comprehensive account of the 
well-established and novel biomarkers in the field, including point mutations, 
fusions, miRNA, and thyroid differentiation genes. Familial and syndromic 
associations are also discussed. Current management guidelines for pediatric 
patients are largely derived from those for adults. An awareness of the 
molecular landscape is essential to acknowledge the uniqueness of these tumors 
and establish specific diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines."
1806,"Serous ovarian cancer is the most common type of ovarian epithelial cancer and 
usually has a poor prognosis. The objective of this study was to construct an 
individualized prognostic model for predicting overall survival in serous 
ovarian cancer. Based on the relative expression orderings (Ea &gt; Eb/Ea ≤ Eb) 
of gene pairs closely associated with serous ovarian prognosis, we tried 
constructing a potential individualized qualitative biomarker by the greedy 
algorithm and evaluated the performance in independent validation datasets. We 
constructed a prognostic biomarker consisting of 20 gene pairs (SOV-P20). The 
overall survival between high- and low-risk groups stratified by SOV-P20 was 
statistically significantly different in the training and independent validation 
datasets from other platforms (p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon test). The average area 
under the curve (AUC) values of the training and three validation datasets were 
0.756, 0.590, 0.630, and 0.680, respectively. The distribution of most immune 
cells between high- and low-risk groups was quite different (p &lt; 0.001, 
Wilcoxon test). The low-risk patients tended to show significantly better tumor 
response to chemotherapy than the high-risk patients (p &lt; 0.05, Fisher's 
exact test). SOV-P20 achieved the highest mean index of concordance (C-index) 
(0.624) compared with the other seven existing prognostic signatures (ranging 
from 0.511 to 0.619). SOV-P20 is a promising prognostic biomarker for serous 
ovarian cancer, which will be applicable for clinical predictive risk 
assessment."
1807,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disease, with autosomal dominant 
transmission, related to pathogenic variant of the tumor suppressor gene NF1 
(17q11.2), predisposing affected subjects to a variety of benign (neurofibromas 
and plexiform neurofibromas) and malignant tumors. The lack of the 
NF1-neurofibromin gene product can cause uncontrolled cell proliferation in the 
central or peripheral nervous system and multisystemic involvement, and so the 
disease includes a heterogeneous group of clinical manifestations. 
Ganglioneuromas are benign tumors developing from the neural crest cells of the 
autonomic nervous system, considered to be part of neuroblastic tumors. Bladder 
localization is extremely rare in adults, and only three such cases were 
reported in children so far. The aim of our study, in addition to a brief review 
of the literature of these pathologies, is to bring to your attention the case 
of a sixteen year old patient with a very rare association of NF1 and bladder 
ganglioneuroma, who presented at the hospital with gross hematuria. Since 
bladder ganglioneuroma is a rare pathological condition, the differential 
diagnosis is difficult and imaging investigations and pathological 
investigations are the ones that elucidate this disease. The clinical approach 
of the medical multidisciplinary team involved should help the patient in 
managing her medical and surgical situation."
1808,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare disease of the lung with a largely 
unknown etiology and a poor prognosis. Intriguingly, forms of familial pulmonary 
fibrosis (FPF) have long been known and linked to specific genetic mutations. 
There is little evidence of the possible role of genetics in the etiology of 
sporadic IPF. We carried out a non-systematic, narrative literature review aimed 
at describing the main known genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that are involved 
in the pathogenesis and prognosis of IPF and FPF. In this review, we highlighted 
the mutations in classical genes associated with FPF, including those encoding 
for telomerases (TERT, TERC, PARN, RTEL1), which are also found in about 10-20% 
of cases of sporadic IPF. In addition to the Mendelian forms, mutations in the 
genes encoding for the surfactant proteins (SFTPC, SFTPA1, SFTPA2, ABCA3) and 
polymorphisms of genes for the mucin MUC5B and the Toll-interacting protein 
TOLLIP are other pathways favoring the fibrogenesis that have been thoroughly 
explored. Moreover, great attention has been paid to the main epigenetic 
alterations (DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA gene 
silencing) that are emerging to play a role in fibrogenesis. Finally, a gaze on 
the shared mechanisms between cancer and fibrogenesis, and future perspectives 
on the genetics of pulmonary fibrosis have been analyzed."
1809,"The goal of this study was to identify the pathogenic gene variants in patients 
with odonto-onycho-dermal dysplasia syndrome (OODD) or nonsyndromic tooth 
agenesis. Four unrelated individuals with tooth agenesis and their available 
family members were recruited. Peripheral blood was collected from four probands 
and five family members. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing were 
used to identify the pathogenic gene variants. The harmfulness of these 
variations was predicted by bioinformatics. We identified four biallelic 
variants of the WNT10A gene in four patients, respectively: the proband#660: 
c.1176C &gt; A (p.Cys392*) and c.812G &gt; A (p.Cys271Tyr); the proband#681: 
c.637G &gt; A (p.Gly213Ser) and c.985C &gt; T (p.Arg329*); the proband#829: 
c.511C &gt; T (p.Arg171Cys) and c.637G &gt; A (p.Gly213Ser); and the 
proband#338: c.926A&gt; G (p.Gln309Arg) and c.511C &gt; T (p.Arg171Cys). Among 
them, two variants (c.812G &gt; A; p.Cys271Tyr and c.985C &gt; T; p.Arg329*) 
were previously unreported. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the 
pathogenicity of these six variants was different. Tertiary structure analysis 
showed that these variants were predicted to cause structural damage to the 
WNT10A protein. Genotype-phenotype analysis showed that the biallelic variants 
with more harmful effects, such as nonsense variants, caused OODD syndrome (#660 
Ⅱ-1) or severe nonsyndromic tooth agenesis (NSTA) (#681 Ⅱ-1); the biallelic 
variants with less harmful effects, such as missense variants, caused a mild 
form of NSTA (#829 Ⅱ-2 and #338 Ⅱ-1). Individuals with a heterozygous variant 
presented a mild form of NSTA or a normal state. Our results further suggest the 
existence of the dose dependence of WNT10A pathogenicity on the tooth agenesis 
pattern, which broadens the variation spectrum and phenotype spectrum of WNT10A 
and could help with clinical diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling."
1810,"Lichen sclerosus (LS) is an acquired chronic inflammatory dermatosis 
predominantly affecting the anogenital area with recalcitrant itching and 
soreness. Progressive or persistent LS may cause urinary and sexual disturbances 
and an increased risk of local skin malignancy with a prevalence of up to 11%. 
Investigations on lipoid proteinosis, an autosomal recessive genodermatosis 
caused by loss-of-function mutations in the extracellular matrix protein 1 
(ECM1) gene, led to the discovery of a humoral autoimmune response to the 
identical molecule in LS, providing evidence for an autoimmune and genetic 
counterpart targeting ECM1. This paper provides an overview of the fundamental 
importance and current issue of better understanding the immunopathology 
attributed to ECM1 in LS. Furthermore, we highlight the pleiotropic action of 
ECM1 in homeostatic and structural maintenance of skin biology as well as in a 
variety of human disorders possibly associated with impaired or gained ECM1 
function, including the inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis, Th2 
cell-dependent airway allergies, T-cell and B-cell activation, and the 
demyelinating central nervous system disease multiple sclerosis, to facilitate 
sharing the concept as a plausible therapeutic target of this attractive 
molecule."
1811,"The development of genomic technology for smart diagnosis and therapies for 
various diseases has lately been the most demanding area for computer-aided 
diagnostic and treatment research. Exponential breakthroughs in artificial 
intelligence and machine intelligence technologies could pave the way for 
identifying challenges afflicting the healthcare industry. Genomics is paving 
the way for predicting future illnesses, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, 
and diabetes. Machine learning advancements have expedited the pace of 
biomedical informatics research and inspired new branches of computational 
biology. Furthermore, knowing gene relationships has resulted in developing more 
accurate models that can effectively detect patterns in vast volumes of data, 
making classification models important in various domains. Recurrent Neural 
Network models have a memory that allows them to quickly remember knowledge from 
previous cycles and process genetic data. The present work focuses on type 2 
diabetes prediction using gene sequences derived from genomic DNA fragments 
through automated feature selection and feature extraction procedures for 
matching gene patterns with training data. The suggested model was tested using 
tabular data to predict type 2 diabetes based on several parameters. The 
performance of neural networks incorporating Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) 
components, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) was 
tested in this research. The model's efficiency is assessed using the evaluation 
metrics such as Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, F1-Score, and Mathews 
Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The suggested technique predicted future 
illnesses with fair Accuracy. Furthermore, our research showed that the 
suggested model could be used in real-world scenarios and that input risk 
variables from an end-user Android application could be kept and evaluated on a 
secure remote server."
1812,"BACKGROUND: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a potentially fatal autoimmune bullous 
disease. The role of microRNA (miRNA, miR) in the diagnosis and pathogenesis of 
PV remains unknown. This study aims to provide potential miRNA biomarkers for PV 
diagnosis and therapy options.
METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 22 PV patients, 15 mucous membrane 
pemphigoid (MMP) patients, and 10 normal controls (NC). Total RNA was extracted 
from the serum samples, and 12 selected miRNAs were detected by quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bioinformatic analyses including 
target gene prediction and enrichment analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Twelve miRNAs were increased in the serum of the PV group compared with 
the NC group, in which six miRNAs had good efficacy to diagnose PV from MMP with 
the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves of 0.970 to 0.988. A 
series test for the combination of miR-584-5p and miR-155-5p reached the 
sensitivity and specificity of 95.5% and 100%. Bioinformatic analysis revealed 
target gene enrichment in the cell adhesion pathways, immune-relating pathways, 
and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: The study provides new insights and targets of miRNAs for the 
precise diagnosis and the exploration of pathogenesis for PV, which may serve as 
a reference for further research into autoimmune bullous diseases."
1813,"Risk-reducing surgery (RRS) is recommended in BRCA-mutated carriers because of 
their increased risk of developing ovarian cancer, while its role is still 
discussed for women harboring mutations in non-BRCA homologous repair genes. The 
aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the occurrence of pathological 
findings in a high-risk population undergoing RRS in San Matteo Hospital, Pavia 
between 2012 and 2022, and correlate their genetic and clinical outcomes, 
comparing them with a control group. The final cohort of 190 patients included 
85 BRCA1, 63 BRCA2, 11 CHEK2, 7 PALB2, 4 ATM, 1 ERCC5, 1 RAD51C, 1 CDH1, 1 MEN1, 
1 MLH1 gene mutation carriers and 15 patients with no known mutation but with 
strong familial risk. Occult invasive serous carcinoma (HGSC) and serous tubal 
intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) were diagnosed in 12 (6.3%) women, all of them 
BRCA carriers. No neoplastic lesion was diagnosed in the non-BRCA group, in 
women with familial risk, or in the control group. Oral contraceptive use and 
age ≤45 at surgery were both found to be favorable factors. While p53 signature 
and serous tubal intraepithelial lesion (STIL) were also seen in the control 
group and in non-BRCA carriers, STIC and HGSC were only found in BRCA1/2 
mutation carriers."
1814,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide. It is a 
malignant and heterogeneous disease with distinct molecular subtypes, which has 
prognostic and predictive implications. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), cell-free 
fragmented tumor-derived DNA in blood plasma, is an invaluable source of 
specific cancer-associated mutations and holds great promise for the development 
of minimally invasive diagnostic tests. Furthermore, serial monitoring of ctDNA 
over the course of systemic and targeted therapies not only allows unparalleled 
efficacy assessments but also enables the identification of patients who are at 
risk of progression or recurrence. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a powerful 
technique for the detection and monitoring of ctDNA. Due to its relatively high 
accuracy, sensitivity, reproducibility, and capacity for absolute 
quantification, it is increasingly used as a tool for managing cancer patients 
through liquid biopsies. In this review paper, we gauge the clinical utility of 
ddPCR as a technique for mutational profiling in breast cancer patients and 
focus on HER2, PIK3CA, ESR1, and TP53, which represent the most frequently 
mutated genes in breast cancers."
1815,"The synthesis of Lewis blood group antigens is governed by two 
fucosyltransferase genes, FUT2 and FUT3. Evidence is accumulating to suggest 
that functional polymorphisms of FUT2 and FUT3 are associated with a variety of 
clinical conditions. Fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA), using three 
different dual-labeled probes for concurrent genotyping of three single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FUT3, c.59T&gt;G, c.314C&gt;T, and 
c.484G&gt;A for Lewis-negative allele inference, was developed and validated 
using Ghanaian and Caucasian subjects. Although two other SNPs, c.55G&gt;A, and 
c.61C&gt;T, are located in the probe sequence for c.59T&gt;G, it seems feasible 
to detect these two SNPs along with c.59T&gt;G. The results obtained by 
probe-based FMCA were in perfect accordance with those obtained by Sanger 
sequencing for 106 Ghanaians and 100 Caucasians. The present method is useful 
and reliable for estimating Lewis-negative alleles on a relatively large scale."
1816,"To save lives from cancer, it is very crucial to diagnose it at its early 
stages. One solution to early diagnosis lies in the identification of the cancer 
driver genes and their mutations. Such diagnostics can substantially minimize 
the mortality rate of this deadly disease. However, concurrently, the 
identification of cancer driver gene mutation through experimental mechanisms 
could be an expensive, slow, and laborious job. The advancement of computational 
strategies that could help in the early prediction of cancer growth effectively 
and accurately is thus highly needed towards early diagnoses and a decrease in 
the mortality rates due to this disease. Herein, we aim to predict clear cell 
renal carcinoma (RCCC) at the level of the genes, using the genomic sequences. 
The dataset was taken from IntOgen Cancer Mutations Browser and all genes' 
standard DNA sequences were taken from the NCBI database. Using 
cancer-associated information of mutation from INTOGEN, the benchmark dataset 
was generated by creating the mutations in original sequences. After extensive 
feature extraction, the dataset was used to train ANN+ Hist Gradient boosting 
that could perform the classification of RCCC genes, other cancer-associated 
genes, and non-cancerous/unknown (non-tumor driver) genes. Through an 
independent dataset test, the accuracy observed was 83%, whereas the 10-fold 
cross-validation and Jackknife validation yielded 98% and 100% accurate results, 
respectively. The proposed predictor RCCC_Pred is able to identify RCCC genes 
with high accuracy and efficiency and can help scientists/researchers easily 
predict and diagnose cancer at its early stages."
1817,"BACKGROUND: Primary macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia (PMAH) is a rare 
form of adrenal Cushing's syndrome with incomplete penetrance which may be 
sporadic or autosomal dominant. The inactivation of the ARMC5 gene, a potential 
tumor suppressor gene, is one of the associated causes of PMAH. This study aimed 
to identify the variant responsible for Iranian familial PMAH.
METHODS: The proband, a 44-year-old woman, was directed to whole-exome 
sequencing (WES) of the blood sample to discover a germline variant. In 
addition, the identified causative variant was confirmed and segregated in other 
and available unaffected family members.
RESULTS: The novel germline heterozygous missense variant, c.2105C&gt;A in the 
ARMC5 gene, was found, and the same germline variant as the proband was 
confirmed in two affected sisters. This variant was detected in the brother of 
the proband with an asymptomatic condition and this considered because of 
incomplete penetrance and age-dependent appearance. The function of the ARMC5 
protein would be damaged by the identified variant, according to in silico and 
computer analyses that followed.
CONCLUSION: The new germline ARMC5 variation (c.2105C&gt;A, (p. Ala702Glu)) was 
interpreted as a likely pathogenic variant based on ACMG and Sherloc standards. 
PMAH may be diagnosed early using genetic testing that shows inherited autosomal 
dominant mutations in the ARMC5 gene."
1818,"Clusterin is a multifunctional protein that is recognized to mediate cellular 
stress response associated with organ failure, systemic inflammation, and 
metabolic alterations. The aim of this study was to determine the value of 
clusterin as a clinical biomarker in critical ill patients with or without 
sepsis. We analyzed clusterin plasma concentrations in 200 critically ill 
patients (133 with sepsis, 67 without sepsis) on admission to the medical 
intensive care unit (ICU). The results were compared with 66 healthy controls. 
Clusterin plasma concentration was significantly elevated in critically ill 
patients compared to healthy subjects. Clusterin levels were significantly 
higher in non-septic ICU patients than in patients with sepsis. Clusterin 
correlated inversely with routinely used biomarkers of inflammatory response. 
Furthermore, clusterin levels were higher in ICU patients with pre-existing 
obesity and type 2 diabetes. Clusterin was not associated with disease severity, 
organ failure, or mortality in the ICU. This study highlights significantly 
elevated clusterin levels in critically ill patients, predominantly in 
non-sepsis conditions, and associates circulating clusterin to inflammatory and 
metabolic dysfunctions."
1819,"After the exclusion of iron deficiency and β-thalassemia, molecular research for 
α-thalassemia is recommended to investigate microcytic anemia. Aiming to suggest 
more efficiently the molecular analysis for individuals with a greater chance of 
having a symptomatic form of the disease, we have developed and validated a new 
decision tool to predict the presence of two or more deletions of α-thalassemia, 
increasing considerably the pre-test probability. The model was created using 
the variables: the percentage of HbA2, serum ferritin and mean corpuscular 
volume standardized by age. The model was trained in 134 patients and validated 
in 160 randomly selected patients from the total sample. We used Youden's index 
applied to the ROC curve methodology to establish the optimal odds ratio (OR) 
cut-off for the presence of two or more α-globin gene deletions. Using the OR 
cut-off of 0.4, the model's negative predictive value (NPV) was 96.8%; the 
cut-off point accuracy was 85.4%; and the molecular analysis pre-test 
probability increased from 25.9% to 65.4% after the use of the proposed model. 
This tool aims to assist the physician in deciding when to perform molecular 
studies for the diagnosis of α-thalassemia. The model is useful in places with 
few financial health resources."
1820,"(1) Background: It is widely accepted that aberrant methylation patterns 
contribute to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Ten-eleven 
translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase is an essential enzyme of which 
there are three members, TET1, 2, and 3, involved in hydroxymethylation, a newly 
uncovered mechanism of active DNA methylation. The epigenomes of gene 
transcription are regulated by 5-hydroxymethylcytocine (5-hmC) and TETs, leading 
to dysregulation of the immune system in SLE. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate the global hydroxymethylation status in SLE peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and to explore the role of TETs in changing the 
patterns of methylation. (2) Methods: We collected PBMCs from 101 SLE patients 
and 100 healthy donors. TaqMan real-time polymerase chain-reaction assay was 
performed for the detection of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), 5-hmC, and TET2 mRNA 
expression and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. The methylation rates 
in different CpG sites of TET2 promoters were examined using next-generation 
sequencing-based deep bisulfite sequencing. Putative transcription factors were 
investigated using the UCSC Genome Browser on the Human Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38) 
Assembly. (3) Results: 5-mC and 5-hmC were both decreased in SLE. The mRNA 
expression level of TET2 was notably high and found to be correlated with the 
levels of immunologic biomarkers that are indicative of SLE disease activity. 
The analysis of methylation rates in the TET2 promoter revealed that SLE 
patients had significantly higher and lower rates of methylation in TET2 
105146072-154 and TET2 105146218-331, respectively. (4) Conclusions: TET2 may 
play an important role in 5-mC/5-hmC dynamics in the PBMCs of SLE patients. The 
epigenetic modification of TET2 promoters could contribute to the pathogenesis 
of SLE and the intensity of the immunologic reaction."
1821,"NUP98::NSD1 fusion, a cryptic translocation of t(5;11)(q35;p15.5), occurs 
predominantly in pediatric AML, having a poor prognostic outcome. There are 
limited studies on the diagnosis of NUP98::NSD1 fusion in a clinical setting, 
and most of the data are from Western countries. No study on the detection of 
this translocation has been reported from the Indian subcontinent to date. One 
possible reason could be the lack of availability of a potential tool to detect 
the fusion transcript. We have developed a real-time quantitative PCR 
(qRT-PCR)-based assay to detect NUP98::NSD1 fusion transcript with high 
sensitivity and specificity. Screening 150 AML patients (38 pediatric and 112 
adults) using the assay showed the presence of fusion transcript in six patients 
including 03 pediatric, and 03 adult patients. We observed a prevalence rate of 
7.89% (3/38) and 2.67% (3/112) fusion transcript in pediatric and adult 
patients, respectively. Sanger sequencing further validated the occurrence of 
NUP98::NSD1 fusion in all six patients. Molecular characterization of these 
patients revealed a co-occurrence of FLT3-ITD mutation, accompanied by altered 
expression of the HOX and other genes associated with AML. All six patients 
responded poorly to induction therapy. Overall, this is the first study to show 
the presence of the NUP98::NSD1 fusion transcript in Indian AML patients. 
Further, we demonstrate that our in-house developed qRT-PCR assay can be used to 
screen NUP98::NSD1 fusion in clinical settings."
1822,"Pseudo-anodontia consists in the clinical, not radiographic, absence of teeth, 
due to failure in their eruption. It has been reported as part of an extremely 
rare syndrome, named GAPO syndrome. Pseudo-hypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHPT-1a) 
is a rare condition, characterized by resistance to the parathyroid hormone 
(PTH), as well as to many other hormones, and resulting in hypocalcemia, 
hyperphosphatemia, and elevated PTH. We report here the case of a 32-year-old 
woman with a long-standing history of non-treated hypocalcemia, in the context 
of an undiagnosed PHPT-1a. She had an intellectual disability, showed clinical 
features of the Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) and presented signs of 
multiple hormone resistances. She received treatment for seizures since the age 
of six. Examination of her mouth revealed a complete absence of teeth. Treatment 
of hypocalcemia and hormone deficiencies were started only at 29 years of age. 
Genetic testing demonstrated the presence of a frameshift variant in the GNAS 
gene in the proband as well as in her mother. A Single Nucleotide Polymorphism 
(SNP) array analysis failed to demonstrate pathogenic copy number variants 
(CNVs) but showed several regions with loss of heterozygosity (LOHs) for a final 
percentage of 1.75%, compatible with a fifth degree of relationship. Clinical 
exome sequencing (CES) ruled out any damaging variants in all the teeth 
agenesis-related genes. In conclusion, although we performed an extensive 
genetic analysis in search of possible additional gene alterations that could 
explain the presence of the peculiar phenotypic characteristics observed in our 
patient, we could not find any additional genetic defects. Our results suggest 
that the association of genetically confirmed PHPT-1a and complete 
pseudo-anodontia associated with persistent patchy alopecia areata is a new 
additional nonclassical feature related to the GNAS pathogenic variant."
1823,"The poliovirus receptor (PVR) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig 
SF) and is essential for the promotion of cancer cell proliferation and 
invasion. However, the correlation between PVR expression and prognosis as well 
as immune infiltration in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The 
expression level of PVR was quantified using the Tumor and Tumor Immunity 
Evaluation Resource (TIMER) and Sangerbox. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database was used to validate the PVR expression. The receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the feasibility of using PVR as 
a differentiating factor according to the area under curve (AUC) score. A PVR 
binding protein network was built using the STRING tool. An enrichment analysis 
using the R package clusterProfiler was used to explore the potential function 
of PVR. Immune infiltration analysis was calculated with ESTIMATE algorithms. We 
also assessed the correlation between PVR expression and immune infiltration by 
the single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) method from the R 
package GSVA and TIMER database. The results showed that PVR was commonly 
overexpressed in multiple types of tumors including HCC. The data of GSE64041 
confirmed the same result. The ROC curve suggested that PVR could be a potential 
diagnostic biomarker. Additionally, high mRNA expression of PVR in HCC was 
significantly correlated with poor overall survival (OS) and relapse free 
survival (RFS). Results also indicated correlations between PVR mRNA expression 
with the level of infiltration immune cells including B cells, CD8+ T cells, 
cytotoxic cells, DCs, CD56dim NK cells, pDCs, and Th2 cells. Furthermore, the 
PVR level was significantly correlated with immune markers for immunosuppressive 
cells in HCC. In conclusion, PVR might be an important regulator of tumor immune 
cell infiltration and a valuable prognostic biomarker in HCC. However, 
additional work is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms."
1824,"The goal of the current study was to identify the pathogenic gene variant in a 
Chinese family with Blepharocheilodontic (BCD) syndrome. Whole-exome sequencing 
(WES) and Sanger sequencing were used to identify the pathogenic gene variant. 
The harmfulness of the variant was predicted by bioinformatics. We identified a 
novel heterozygous missense variant c.1198G&gt;A (p.Asp400Asn) in the CDH1 gene 
in the proband and his mother with BCD syndrome. The sequencing results of three 
healthy individuals in this family are wild type. This result is consistent with 
familial co-segregation. According to ReVe, REVEL, CADD, gnomAD, dbSNP, and the 
classification of pathogenic variants with the standards of the 2015 American 
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular 
Pathology (ACMG), c.1198G&gt;A (p.Asp400Asn) is predicted to be a likely 
pathogenic. We observed that variant c.1198G&gt;A (p.Asp400Asn) was located in 
the extracellular cadherin-type repeats in CDH1. Amino acid sequence alignment 
of the CDH1 protein among multiple species showed that Asp400 was highly 
evolutionarily conserved. The conformational analysis showed that this variant 
might cause structural damage to the CDH1 protein. Phenotypic analysis revealed 
unique dental phenotypes in patients with BCD syndrome, such as oligodontia, 
conical-shaped teeth, and notching of the incisal edges. Our results broaden the 
variation spectrum of BCD syndrome and phenotype spectrum of CDH1, which can 
help with the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counseling in relation 
to BCD syndrome."
1825,"As a result of the increasing use of improved detection methods, Kingella 
kingae, a Gram-negative component of the pediatric oropharyngeal microbiota, is 
increasingly appreciated as the prime etiology of septic arthritis, 
osteomyelitis, and spondylodiscitis in children aged 6 to 48 months. The medical 
literature was reviewed to summarize the laboratory methods required for 
detecting the organism. Kingella kingae is notoriously fastidious, and seeding 
skeletal system samples onto solid culture media usually fails to isolate it. 
Inoculation of synovial fluid aspirates and bone exudates into blood culture 
vials enhances Kingella kingae recovery by diluting detrimental factors in the 
specimen. The detection of the species has been further improved by nucleic acid 
amplification tests, especially by using species-specific primers targeting 
Kingella kingae's rtxA, groEL, and mdh genes in a real-time PCR platform. 
Although novel metagenomic next-generation technology performed in the patient's 
plasma sample (liquid biopsy) has not yet reached its full potential, 
improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of the method will probably make 
this approach the primary means of diagnosing Kingella kingae infections in the 
future."
1826,"BACKGROUND: Unraveling the genetic background in a significant proportion of 
patients with both sporadic and familial IPF provided new insights into the 
pathogenic pathways of pulmonary fibrosis.
AIM: The aim of the present study is to overview the clinical significance of 
genetics in IPF.
PERSPECTIVE: It is fascinating to realize the so-far underestimated but 
dynamically increasing impact that genetics has on aspects related to the 
pathophysiology, accurate and early diagnosis, and treatment and prevention of 
this devastating disease. Genetics in IPF have contributed as no other in 
unchaining the disease from the dogma of a ""a sporadic entity of the elderly, 
limited to the lungs"" and allowed all scientists, but mostly clinicians, all 
over the world to consider its many aspects and ""faces"" in all age groups, 
including its co-existence with several extra pulmonary conditions from 
cutaneous albinism to bone-marrow and liver failure.
CONCLUSION: By providing additional evidence for unsuspected characteristics 
such as immunodeficiency, impaired mucus, and surfactant and telomere 
maintenance that very often co-exist through the interaction of common and rare 
genetic variants in the same patient, genetics have created a generous and 
pluralistic yet unifying platform that could lead to the understanding of the 
injurious and pro-fibrotic effects of many seemingly unrelated extrinsic and 
intrinsic offending factors. The same platform constantly instructs us about our 
limitations as well as about the heritability, the knowledge and the wisdom that 
is still missing."
1827,"Lung cancers are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Studies 
have shown that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which constitutes the 
majority of lung cancers, is significantly more responsive to early-stage 
interventions. However, the early stages are often asymptomatic, and current 
diagnostic methods are limited in their precision and safety. The cell-free RNAs 
(cfRNAs) circulating in plasma (liquid biopsies) offer a non-invasive detection 
of spatial and temporal changes occurring in primary tumors since the early 
stages. To address gaps in the current cfRNA knowledge base, we conducted a 
pilot study for the comprehensive analysis of transcriptome-wide changes in 
plasma cfRNA in NSCLC patients. Total cfRNA was extracted from archived plasma 
collected from NSCLC patients (N = 12), cancer-free former smokers (N = 12), and 
non-smoking healthy volunteers (N = 12). Plasma cfRNA expression levels were 
quantified by using a tagmentation-based library preparation and sequencing. The 
comparisons of cfRNA expression levels between patients and the two control 
groups revealed a total of 2357 differentially expressed cfRNAs enriched in 123 
pathways. Of these, 251 transcripts were previously reported in primary NSCLCs. 
A small subset of genes (N = 5) was validated in an independent sample (N = 50) 
using qRT-PCR. Our study provides a framework for developing blood-based assays 
for the early detection of NSCLC and warrants further validation."
1828,"Infertility affects lots of couples, half of which are caused by male factors. 
The LanCL1 gene is highly expressed in testis specifically, which might affect 
the development of sperms. In order to understand the potential functions of the 
LanCL1 gene in the testis, this study was conducted with constructed transgenic 
LanCL1 knockout mice. The mouse breeding experiment, semen analysis and 
single-cell RNAseq of testicular tissue were performed. Results suggested that 
the LanCL1 gene would significantly influence the reproduction ability and sperm 
motility of male mice. Single-cell RNAseq also confirmed the high expression of 
the LanCL1 gene in the spermatocytes and spermatids. Downregulating the LanCL1 
gene expression could promote M2 macrophage polarity to maintain testicular 
homeostasis. Moreover, the LanCL1 gene could affect both the germ cells and 
stromal cells through various pathways such as the P53 signaling and the PPAR 
signaling pathway to disturb the normal process of spermatogenesis. However, no 
effects of the LanCL1 gene in testosterone synthesis and serum testosterone 
level were shown. Further studies are needed to discuss the mechanisms of the 
LanCL1 gene in the various cells of the testis independently."
1829,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death around the world. 
Based on the roles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members 
to regulate blood and lymphatic vessels and metabolic functions, several 
therapeutic approaches have been attempted during the last decade. However 
proangiogenic therapies based on classical VEGF-A have been disappointing. 
Therefore, it has become important to focus on other VEGFs such as VEGF-B, which 
is a novel member of the VEGF family. Recent studies have shown the very 
promising potential of the VEGF-B to treat CHD and heart failure. The aim of 
this review article is to present the role of VEGF-B in endothelial biology and 
as a potential therapeutic agent for CHD and heart failure. In addition, key 
differences between the VEGF-A and VEGF-B effects on endothelial functions are 
demonstrated."
1830,"Lactobacillus spp., as probiotics, have shown efficacy in alleviating 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Here, we screened a new probiotic 
strain, Lactobacillus salivarius SNK-6 (L. salivarius SNK-6), which was isolated 
from the ileum of healthy Xinyang black-feather laying hens in China. We 
investigated the beneficial activity of L. salivarius SNK-6 in a NAFLD model in 
laying hens and found that L. salivarius SNK-6 inhibited liver fat deposition 
and decreased serum triglyceride levels and activity of aspartate transaminase 
and alanine transaminase. MBOAT2 (membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain 
containing 2) was directly targeted by miR-130a-5p, which was downregulated in 
the liver of NAFLD laying hens but reversed after L. salivarius SNK-6 treatment. 
Downregulation of MBOAT2, L. salivarius SNK-6 supplementation in vivo, and L. 
salivarius SNK-6 cell culture treatment in vitro suppressed the mRNA expression 
of genes involved in the PPAR/SREBP pathway. In addition, 250 metabolites were 
identified in the supernatants of L. salivarius SNK-6 culture media, and most of 
them participated in metabolic pathways, including amino acid, carbohydrate, and 
lipid metabolism. Targeted metabolomic analysis revealed that acetate, butyrate, 
and propionate were the most abundant short-chain fatty acids, while cholic 
acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, and tauroursodeoxycholic acid 
were the four most-enriched bile acids among L. salivarius SNK-6 metabolites. 
This may have contributed to the reparative effect of L. salivarius SNK-6 in the 
NAFLD chicken model. Our study suggested that L. salivarius SNK-6 alleviated 
liver damage partly via the miR-130a-5p/MBOAT2 signaling pathway."
1831,"End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a multifactorial condition influenced by 
genetic background, but the extent to which a genetic risk score (GRS) improves 
ESKD prediction is unknown. We built a redox GRS on the base of previous 
association studies (six polymorphisms from six redox genes) and tested its 
relationship with ESKD in three cohorts of people with type 1 diabetes. Among 
1012 participants, ESKD (hemodialysis requirement, kidney transplantation, eGFR 
&lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m2) occurred in 105 (10.4%) during a 14-year follow-up. High 
redox GRS was associated with increased ESKD risk (adjusted HR for the upper 
versus the lowest GRS tertile: 2.60 (95% CI, 1.51-4.48), p = 0.001). Each 
additional risk-allele was associated with a 20% increased risk of ESKD (95% CI, 
8-33, p &lt; 0.0001). High GRS yielded a relevant population attributable 
fraction (30%), but only a marginal enhancement in c-statistics index (0.928 
[0.903-0.954]) over clinical factors 0.921 (0.892-0.950), p = 0.04). This is the 
first report of an independent association between redox GRS and increased risk 
of ESKD in type 1 diabetes. Our results do not support the use of this GRS in 
clinical practice but provide new insights into the involvement of oxidative 
stress genetic factors in ESKD risk in type 1 diabetes."
1832,"Umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (UC-BSCs) are cells with low 
immunogenicity and differentiation potential, and the transfer of exosomes 
carried by UC-BSCs can regulate innate and adaptive immunity and affect immune 
homeostasis. This is an area of focus for autoimmune illnesses such as systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE). The target of this research was to investigate the 
immunomodulatory effect of exosomes produced from mesenchymal stem cells on SLE 
and its mechanism. After isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
from the SLE group and healthy group and treatment of SLE-derived PBMCs with 
UC-BSC-derived exosomes, the mRNA levels of corresponding factors in cells under 
different treatments were determined by RT-PCR, Th17/Treg content was analyzed 
by FCM (flow cytometry), and the targeted binding of microRNA-19b (miR-19b) to 
KLF13 was identified by in vitro experiments and bioinformatics analysis. The 
findings demonstrated that PBMC cells from SLE patients had higher proportions 
of Th17 subsets than the control group, whereas Treg subgroups with lower 
percentages were discovered. miR-19b's expression level was markedly reduced, 
which was inversely associated to the concentration of KLF13. In vitro 
experiments show that UC-BSC-derived exosome treatment can target KLF13 
expression by increasing the miR-19b level, thereby regulating Th17/Treg balance 
and inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors. According to the study's 
findings, SLE patients have dysregulated expression of the genes miR-19b and 
KLF13, and UC-BSC exosomes could regulate Th17/Treg cell balance and 
inflammatory factor expression in SLE patients through miR-19b/KLF13."
1833,"PURPOSE: Mitochondrial dysfunction is central to breaking the barrier integrity 
of retinal endothelial cells (RECs) in various blinding eye diseases such as 
diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity. Therefore, we aimed to 
investigate the role of different mitochondrial constituents, specifically those 
of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), in maintaining the barrier function of 
RECs.
METHODS: Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) technology was used to 
assess in real time the role of different mitochondrial components in the total 
impedance (Z) of human RECs (HRECs) and its components: capacitance (C) and the 
total resistance (R). HRECs were treated with specific mitochondrial inhibitors 
that target different steps in OxPhos: rotenone for complex I, oligomycin for 
complex V (ATP synthase), and FCCP for uncoupling OxPhos. Furthermore, data were 
modeled to investigate the effects of these inhibitors on the three parameters 
that govern the total resistance of cells: Cell-cell interactions (Rb), 
cell-matrix interactions (α), and cell membrane permeability (Cm).
RESULTS: Rotenone (1 µM) produced the greatest reduction in Z, followed by FCCP 
(1 µM), whereas no reduction in Z was observed after oligomycin (1 µM) 
treatment. We then further deconvoluted the effects of these inhibitors on the 
Rb, α, and Cm parameters. Rotenone (1 µM) completely abolished the resistance 
contribution of Rb, as the Rb became zero immediately after the treatment. 
Secondly, FCCP (1 µM) eliminated the resistance contribution of Rb only after 
2.5 h and increased Cm without a significant effect on α. Lastly, of all the 
inhibitors used, oligomycin had the lowest impact on Rb, as evidenced by the 
fact that this value became similar to that of the control group at the end of 
the experiment without noticeable effects on Cm or α.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the differential roles of complex I, complex 
V, and OxPhos coupling in maintaining the barrier functionality of HRECs. We 
specifically showed that complex I is the most important component in regulating 
HREC barrier integrity. These observed differences are significant since they 
could serve as the basis for future pharmacological and gene expression studies 
aiming to improve the activity of complex I and thereby provide avenues for 
therapeutic modalities in endothelial-associated retinal diseases."
1834,"Mature and efficient tissue culture systems are already available for most 
japonica rice varieties (Oryza sativa ssp. geng). However, it remains 
challenging to regenerate the majority of indica rice varieties 
(Oryza&amp;nbsp;sativa ssp. xian). In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) 
associated with rice callus regeneration ability were identified based on the 
plant regeneration rate (PRR) and total green plant rate (TGPR) of the 93-11 × 
Nip recombinant inbred line population. Significant positive correlations were 
found between PRR and TGPR. A total of three QTLs (one for PRR and two for TGPR) 
were identified. qPRR3 (located on chromosome 3) was detected for both traits, 
which could explain 13.40% and 17.07% of the phenotypic variations of PRR and 
TGPR, respectively. Subsequently, the effect of qPRR3 on callus regeneration 
ability was validated by cryptographically tagged near-isogenic lines (NILs), 
and the QTL was narrowed to an interval of approximately 160 kb. The anatomical 
structure observation of the regenerated callus of the NILs revealed that qPRR3 
can improve the callus regeneration ability by promoting the regeneration of 
shoots."
1835,"Formerly hailed as ""undruggable"" proteins, transcription factors (TFs) are now 
under investigation for targeted therapy. In cancer, this may alter, inter alia, 
immune evasion or replicative immortality, which are implicated in genome 
organization, a process that accompanies multi-step tumorigenesis and which 
frequently develops in a non-random manner. Still, targeting-related research on 
some TFs is scarce, e.g., among AP-2 proteins, which are known for their altered 
functionality in cancer and prognostic importance. Using public repositories, 
bioinformatics tools, and RNA-seq data, the present study examined the 
ligandability of all AP-2 members, selecting the best one, which was 
investigated in terms of mutations, targets, co-activators, correlated genes, 
and impact on genome organization. AP-2 proteins were found to have the 
conserved ""TF_AP-2"" domain, but manifested different binding characteristics and 
evolution. Among them, AP-2δ has not only the highest number of 
post-translational modifications and extended strands but also contains a 
specific histidine-rich region and cleft that can receive a ligand. Uterine, 
colon, lung, and stomach tumors are most susceptible to AP-2δ mutations, which 
also co-depend with cancer hallmark genes and drug targets. Considering AP-2δ 
targets, some of them were located proximally in the spatial genome or served as 
co-factors of the genes regulated by AP-2δ. Correlation and functional analyses 
suggested that AP-2δ affects various processes, including genome organization, 
via its targets; this has been eventually verified in lung adenocarcinoma using 
expression and immunohistochemistry data of chromosomal conformation-related 
genes. In conclusion, AP-2δ affects chromosomal conformation and is the most 
appropriate target for cancer therapy focused on the AP-2 family."
1836,"To understand complex diseases, high-throughput data are generated at large and 
multiple levels. However, extracting meaningful information from large datasets 
for comprehensive understanding of cell phenotypes and disease pathophysiology 
remains a major challenge. Despite tremendous advances in understanding 
molecular mechanisms of cancer and its progression, current knowledge appears 
discrete and fragmented. In order to render this wealth of data more integrated 
and thus informative, we have developed a GECIP toolbox to investigate the 
crosstalk and the responsible genes'/proteins' connectivity of enriched pathways 
from gene expression data. To implement this toolbox, we used mainly gene 
expression datasets of prostate cancer, and the three datasets were GSE17951, 
GSE8218, and GSE1431. The raw samples were processed for normalization, 
prediction of differentially expressed genes, and the prediction of enriched 
pathways for the differentially expressed genes. The enriched pathways have been 
processed for crosstalk degree calculations for which number connections per 
gene, the frequency of genes in the pathways, sharing frequency, and the 
connectivity have been used. For network prediction, protein-protein interaction 
network database FunCoup2.0 was used, and cytoscape software was used for the 
network visualization. In our results, we found that there were enriched 
pathways 27, 45, and 22 for GSE17951, GSE8218, and GSE1431, respectively, and 11 
pathways in common between all of them. From the crosstalk results, we observe 
that focal adhesion and PI3K pathways, both experimentally proven central for 
cellular output upon perturbation of numerous individual/distinct signaling 
pathways, displayed highest crosstalk degree. Moreover, we also observe that 
there were more critical pathways which appear to be highly significant, and 
these pathways are HIF1a, hippo, AMPK, and Ras. In terms of the pathways' 
components, GSK3B, YWHAE, HIF1A, ATP1A3, and PRKCA are shared between the 
aforementioned pathways and have higher connectivity with the pathways and the 
other pathway components. Finally, we conclude that the focal adhesion and PI3K 
pathways are the most critical pathways, and since for many other pathways, 
high-rank enrichment did not translate to high crosstalk degree, the global 
impact of one pathway on others appears distinct from enrichment."
1837,"The PSEN1 ΔE9 mutation causes a familial form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by 
shifting the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) towards the 
generation of highly amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptide. We have previously shown that 
the PSEN1 ΔE9 mutation in human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived 
astrocytes increases Aβ42 production and impairs cellular responses. Here, we 
injected PSEN1 ΔE9 mutant astrosphere-derived glial progenitors into newborn 
mice and investigated mouse behavior at the ages of 8, 12, and 16 months. While 
we did not find significant behavioral changes in younger mice, spatial learning 
and memory were paradoxically improved in 16-month-old PSEN1 ΔE9 
glia-transplanted male mice as compared to age-matched isogenic 
control-transplanted animals. Memory improvement was associated with lower 
levels of soluble, but not insoluble, human Aβ42 in the mouse brain. We also 
found a decreased engraftment of PSEN1 ΔE9 mutant cells in the cingulate cortex 
and significant transcriptional changes in both human and mouse genes in the 
hippocampus, including the extracellular matrix-related genes. Overall, the 
presence of PSEN1 ΔE9 mutant glia exerted a more beneficial effect on aged mouse 
brain than the isogenic control human cells likely as a combination of several 
factors."
1838,"Hepatocytes exhibit a multi-polarized state under the in vivo physiological 
environment, however, human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocytes (hEHs) 
rarely exhibit polarity features in a two-dimensional (2D) condition. Thus, we 
hypothesized whether the polarized differentiation might enhance the maturity 
and liver function of hEHs. In this study, we obtained the polarized hEHs 
(phEHs) by using 2D differentiation in conjunct with employing transwell-based 
polarized culture. Our results showed that phEHs directionally secreted albumin, 
urea and bile acids, and afterward, the apical membrane and blood-bile barrier 
(BBIB) were identified to form in phEHs. Moreover, phEHs exhibited a higher 
maturity and capacitity of cellular secretory and drug metabolism than those of 
non-phEHs. Through transcriptome analysis, it was found that the polarized 
differentiation induced obvious changes in gene expression profiles of cellular 
adhesion and membrane transport in hEHs. Our further investigation revealed that 
the activation of Hippo and AMPK signaling pathways made contributions to the 
regulation of function and cellular polarity in phEHs, further verifying that 
the liver function of hEHs was closely related with their polarization state. 
These results not only demonstrated that the polarized differentiation enhanced 
the maturity and liver function of hEHs, but also identified the molecular 
targets that regulated the polarization state of hEHs."
1839,"The study describes a protocol for methylation analysis integrated with Machine 
Learning (ML) algorithms developed to classify Facio-Scapulo-Humeral Dystrophy 
(FSHD) subjects. The DNA methylation levels of two D4Z4 regions (DR1 and 
DUX4-PAS) were assessed by an in-house protocol based on bisulfite sequencing 
and capillary electrophoresis, followed by statistical and ML analyses. The 
study involved two independent cohorts, namely a training group of 133 patients 
with clinical signs of FSHD and 150 healthy controls (CTRL) and a testing set of 
27 FSHD patients and 25 CTRL. As expected, FSHD patients showed significantly 
reduced methylation levels compared to CTRL. We utilized single CpG sites to 
develop a ML pipeline able to discriminate FSHD subjects. The model identified 
four CpGs sites as the most relevant for the discrimination of FSHD subjects and 
showed high metrics values (accuracy: 0.94, sensitivity: 0.93, specificity: 
0.96). Two additional models were developed to differentiate patients with lower 
D4Z4 size and patients who might carry pathogenic variants in FSHD genes, 
respectively. Overall, the present model enables an accurate classification of 
FSHD patients, providing additional evidence for DNA methylation as a powerful 
disease biomarker that could be employed for prioritizing subjects to be tested 
for FSHD."
1840,"Astrocytes are important for maintaining cholesterol metabolism, glutamate 
uptake, and neurotransmission. Indeed, inflammatory processes and 
neurodegeneration contribute to the altered morphology, gene expression, and 
function of astrocytes. Astrocytes, in collaboration with numerous microRNAs, 
regulate brain cholesterol levels as well as glutamatergic and inflammatory 
signaling, all of which contribute to general brain homeostasis. Neural 
electrical activity, synaptic plasticity processes, learning, and memory are 
dependent on the astrocyte-neuron crosstalk. Here, we review the involvement of 
astrocytic microRNAs that potentially regulate cholesterol metabolism, glutamate 
uptake, and inflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The interaction between 
astrocytic microRNAs and long non-coding RNA and transcription factors specific 
to astrocytes also contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, astrocytic 
microRNAs arise as a promising target, as AD conditions are a worldwide public 
health problem. This review examines novel therapeutic strategies to target 
astrocyte dysfunction in AD, such as lipid nanodiscs, engineered G 
protein-coupled receptors, extracellular vesicles, and nanoparticles."
1841,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are important immune cells in the tumor 
microenvironment (TME). Previous studies have shown that TAMs play a dual role 
in the development of colorectal cancer and promote the additional exploration 
of the immune escape of colorectal cancer. Studies have confirmed that 
macrophages utilize amino acid metabolism under the stimulation of some factors 
released by tumor cells, thus affecting the direction of polarization. 
Therefore, we investigated the effect of amino acid metabolism on macrophage 
function and the involved mechanism. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the 
GSE18804 GEO dataset and amino acid metabolism pathway, we identified the eight 
key enzymes of amino acid metabolism in colon TAMs, namely, ACADM, ACADS, GPX4, 
GSR, HADH, HMGCL, HMGCS1 and IDH1. We then evaluated the expression, survival 
analysis and relationship of clinicopathological features with these eight key 
enzymes. The results supported the critical role of these eight genes in 
colorectal cancer. Macrophages phagocytose tumor cells, and these eight key 
enzymes were identified in combination with GPX4, a critical protein of 
ferroptosis, suggesting that the change in the expression of these eight key 
enzymes in TAMs may be involved in the regulation of colorectal cancer through 
cell death. Correlation analysis of three programmed cell death (PCD) marker 
genes indicated that these eight key enzymes may cause macrophage death through 
pyroptosis, leading to immune escape of colorectal cancer. We also investigated 
the regulation of ACADS in CRC using flow cytometry, qPCR and ELISAs, which 
demonstrated that an ACADS deficiency polarizes TAMs to M2 macrophages. In 
summary, the present study revealed the relationship between amino acid 
metabolism and the cell death of macrophages, providing a new research direction 
for the molecular mechanism of macrophage polarization."
1842,"In the environmental and organism context, oxidative stress is complex and 
unavoidable. Organisms simultaneously cope with a various combination of stress 
factors in natural conditions. For example, excess light stress is accompanied 
by UV stress, heat shock stress, and/or water stress. Reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and antioxidant molecules, coordinated by electrical signalling (ES), are 
an integral part of the stress signalling network in cells and organisms. They 
together regulate gene expression to redirect energy to growth, acclimation, or 
defence, and thereby, determine cellular stress memory and stress crosstalk. In 
plants, both abiotic and biotic stress increase energy quenching, 
photorespiration, stomatal closure, and leaf temperature, while toning down 
photosynthesis and transpiration. Locally applied stress induces ES, ROS, 
retrograde signalling, cell death, and cellular light memory, then acclimation 
and defence responses in the local organs, whole plant, or even plant community 
(systemic acquired acclimation, systemic acquired resistance, network acquired 
acclimation). A simplified analogy can be found in animals where diseases vs. 
fitness and prolonged lifespan vs. faster aging, are dependent on mitochondrial 
ROS production and ES, and body temperature is regulated by sweating, 
temperature-dependent respiration, and gene regulation. In this review, we 
discuss the universal features of stress factors, ES, the cellular production of 
ROS molecules, ROS scavengers, hormones, and other regulators that coordinate 
life and death."
1843,"Several endocrine signals mediate mosquito egg development, including 
20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). This study reports on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as an 
additional, but core, mediator of oogenesis in a human disease-vectoring 
mosquito, Aedes albopictus. Injection of aspirin (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 
(COX)) after blood-feeding (BF) inhibited oogenesis by preventing nurse cell 
dumping into a growing oocyte. The inhibitory effect was rescued by PGE2 
addition. PGE2 was found to be rich in nurse cells and follicular epithelium 
after BF. RNA interference (RNAi) treatments of PG biosynthetic genes, including 
PLA2 and two COX-like peroxidases, prevented egg development. Interestingly, 20E 
treatment significantly increased the expressions of PG biosynthetic genes, 
while the RNAi of Shade (which is a 20E biosynthetic gene) expression prevented 
inducible expressions after BF. Furthermore, RNAi treatments of PGE2 receptor 
genes suppressed egg production, even under PGE2. These results suggest that a 
signaling pathway of BF-20E-PGE2 is required for early vitellogenesis in the 
mosquito."
1844,"Carriers of single pathogenic variants of the CFTR (cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator) gene have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 
and 14-day death. The machine learning post-Mendelian model pinpointed CFTR as a 
bidirectional modulator of COVID-19 outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that the rare 
complex allele [G576V;R668C] is associated with a milder disease via a 
gain-of-function mechanism. Conversely, CFTR ultra-rare alleles with reduced 
function are associated with disease severity either alone (dominant disorder) 
or with another hypomorphic allele in the second chromosome (recessive disorder) 
with a global residual CFTR activity between 50 to 91%. Furthermore, we 
characterized novel CFTR complex alleles, including [A238V;F508del], 
[R74W;D1270N;V201M], [I1027T;F508del], [I506V;D1168G], and simple alleles, 
including R347C, F1052V, Y625N, I328V, K68E, A309D, A252T, G542*, V562I, R1066H, 
I506V, I807M, which lead to a reduced CFTR function and thus, to more severe 
COVID-19. In conclusion, CFTR genetic analysis is an important tool in 
identifying patients at risk of severe COVID-19."
1845,"Myc, a member of the ""Myc Network"" of bHLH-ZIP transcription factors, supervises 
proliferation, metabolism, and translation. It also engages in crosstalk with 
the related ""Mlx Network"" to co-regulate overlapping genes and functions. We 
investigated the consequences of stepwise conditional inactivation of Myc and 
Mlx in primary and SV40 T-antigen-immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts 
(MEFs). Myc-knockout (MycKO) and Myc × Mlx ""double KO"" (DKO)-but not 
MlxKO-primary MEFs showed rapid growth arrest and displayed features of 
accelerated aging and senescence. However, DKO MEFs soon resumed proliferating, 
indicating that durable growth arrest requires an intact Mlx network. All three 
KO MEF groups deregulated multiple genes and functions pertaining to aging, 
senescence, and DNA damage recognition/repair. Immortalized KO MEFs proliferated 
in Myc's absence while demonstrating variable degrees of widespread genomic 
instability and sensitivity to genotoxic agents. Finally, compared to primary 
MycKO MEFs, DKO MEFs selectively downregulated numerous gene sets associated 
with the p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) pathways and G2/M arrest. Thus, the 
reversal of primary MycKO MEF growth arrest by either Mlx loss or SV40 T-antigen 
immortalization appears to involve inactivation of the p53 and/or Rb pathways."
1846,"Despite decades of research, sepsis remains one of the most urgent unmet medical 
needs. Mechanistic investigations into sepsis have mainly focused on targeting 
inflammatory pathways; however, recent data indicate that sepsis should also be 
seen as a metabolic disease. Targeting metabolic dysregulations that take place 
in sepsis might uncover novel therapeutic opportunities. The role of peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARɑ) in liver dysfunction during sepsis 
has recently been described, and restoring PPARɑ signaling has proven to be 
successful in mouse polymicrobial sepsis. To confirm that such therapy might be 
translated to septic patients, we analyzed metabolic perturbations in the liver 
of a porcine fecal peritonitis model. Resuscitation with fluids, vasopressor, 
antimicrobial therapy and abdominal lavage were applied to the pigs in order to 
mimic human clinical care. By using RNA-seq, we detected downregulated PPARɑ 
signaling in the livers of septic pigs and that reduced PPARɑ levels correlated 
well with disease severity. As PPARɑ regulates the expression of many genes 
involved in fatty acid oxidation, the reduced expression of these target genes, 
concomitant with increased free fatty acids in plasma and ectopic lipid 
deposition in the liver, was observed. The results obtained with pigs are in 
agreement with earlier observations seen in mice and support the potential of 
targeting defective PPARɑ signaling in clinical research."
1847,"Prostate cancer bone metastasis is still one of the most fatal cancer diagnoses 
for men. Survival of the circulating prostate tumor cells and their adaptation 
strategy to survive in the bone niche is the key point to determining metastasis 
in early cancer stages. The promoter of SFRP2 gene, encoding a WNT signaling 
modulator, is hypermethylated in many cancer types including prostate cancer. 
Moreover, SFRP2 can positively regulate osteogenic differentiation in vitro and 
in vivo. Here, we showed SFRP2 overexpression in the prostate cancer cell line 
PC3 induces an epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), increases the 
attachment, and modifies the transcriptome towards an osteoblast-like phenotype 
(osteomimicry) in a collagen 1-dependent manner. Our data reflect a novel 
molecular mechanism concerning how metastasizing prostate cancer cells might 
increase their chance to survive within bone tissue."
1848,"A study by Tsvetkov et al. recently published a proposed novel form of 
copper-induced cell death in Science; however, few studies have looked into the 
possible mechanism in soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Herein, this study sought to 
investigate the function of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in the development 
of tumor-associated immune cells and the prognosis of sarcoma. Herein, this 
study aimed to explore the role of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in the 
development, tumor-associated immune cells, and the prognosis of sarcoma.
METHODS: The prognostic model was established via the least absolute shrinkage 
and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm as well as multivariate Cox regression 
analysis. The stromal scores, immune scores, ESTIMA scores, and tumor purity of 
sarcoma patients were evaluated by the ESTIMATE algorithm. Functional analyses 
were performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of immune cell 
infiltration and the prognosis of CRGs in sarcoma.
RESULTS: Two molecular subgroups with different CRG expression patterns were 
recognized, which showed that patients with a higher immune score and more 
active immune status were prone to have better prognostic survival. Moreover, GO 
and KEGG analyses showed that these differentially expressed CRGs were mainly 
enriched in metabolic/ions-related signaling pathways, indicating that CRGs may 
have impacts on the immune cell infiltration and prognosis of sarcoma via 
regulating the bioprocess of mitochondria and consequently affecting the immune 
microenvironment. The expression levels of CRGs were closely correlated to the 
immunity condition and prognostic survival of sarcoma patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The interaction between cuproptosis and immunity in sarcoma may 
provide a novel insight into the study of molecular mechanisms and candidate 
biomarkers for the prognosis, resulting in effective treatments for sarcoma 
patients."
1849,"Cells employ several adaptive mechanisms under conditions of accelerated cell 
division, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is composed of a 
tripartite signaling system that involves ATF6, PERK, and IRE1, which maintain 
protein homeostasis (proteostasis). However, deregulation of protein translation 
initiation could be associated with breast cancer (BC) chemoresistance. 
Specifically, eukaryotic initiation factor-4A (eIF4A) is involved in the 
unfolding of the secondary structures of several mRNAs at the 5' untranslated 
region (5'-UTR), as well as in the regulation of targets involved in 
chemoresistance. Importantly, the tumor suppressor gene PDCD4 could modulate 
this process. This regulation might be disrupted in chemoresistant triple 
negative-BC (TNBC) cells. Therefore, we characterized the effect of doxorubicin 
(Dox), a commonly used anthracycline medication, on human breast carcinoma 
MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, we generated and characterized models of Dox 
chemoresistance, and chemoresistant cells exhibited lower Dox internalization 
levels followed by alteration of the IRE1 and PERK arms of the UPR and 
triggering of the antioxidant Nrf2 axis. Critically, chemoresistant cells 
exhibited PDCD4 downregulation, which coincided with a reduction in eIF4A 
interaction, suggesting a sophisticated regulation of protein translation. 
Likewise, Dox-induced chemoresistance was associated with alterations in 
cellular migration and invasion, which are key cancer hallmarks, coupled with 
changes in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation and secretion of matrix 
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Moreover, eIF4A knockdown via siRNA and its 
overexpression in chemoresistant cells suggested that eIF4A regulates FAK. 
Pro-atherogenic low-density lipoproteins (LDL) promoted cellular invasion in 
parental and chemoresistant cells in an MMP-9-dependent manner. Moreover, Dox 
only inhibited parental cell invasion. Significantly, chemoresistance was 
modulated by cryptotanshinone (Cry), a natural terpene purified from the roots 
of Salvia brandegeei. Cry and Dox co-exposure induced chemosensitization, 
connected with the Cry effect on eIF4A interaction. We further demonstrated the 
Cry binding capability on eIF4A and in silico assays suggest Cry inhibition on 
the RNA-processing domain. Therefore, strategic disruption of protein 
translation initiation is a druggable pathway by natural compounds during 
chemoresistance in TNBC. However, plasmatic LDL levels should be closely 
monitored throughout treatment."
1850,"Mutations in genes encoding proteins associated with the linker of 
nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex within the nuclear envelope cause 
different diseases with varying phenotypes including skeletal muscle, cardiac, 
metabolic, or nervous system pathologies. There is some understanding of the 
structure of LINC complex-associated proteins and how they interact, but it is 
unclear how mutations in genes encoding them can cause the same disease, and 
different diseases with different phenotypes. Here, published mutations in LINC 
complex-associated proteins were systematically reviewed and analyzed to 
ascertain whether patterns exist between the genetic sequence variants and 
clinical phenotypes. This revealed LMNA is the only LINC complex-associated gene 
in which mutations commonly cause distinct conditions, and there are no clear 
genotype-phenotype correlations. Clusters of LMNA variants causing striated 
muscle disease are located in exons 1 and 6, and metabolic disease-associated 
LMNA variants are frequently found in the tail of lamin A/C. Additionally, exon 
6 of the emerin gene, EMD, may be a mutation ""hot-spot"", and diseases related to 
SYNE1, encoding nesprin-1, are most often caused by nonsense type mutations. 
These results provide insight into the diverse roles of LINC-complex proteins in 
human disease and provide direction for future gene-targeted therapy 
development."
1851,"The mammalian STE 20-like protein kinase 4 (MST4) gene is highly expressed in 
several cancer types, but little is known about the role of MST4 in breast 
cancer, and the function of MST4 during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
has not been fully elucidated. Here we report that overexpression of MST4 in 
breast cancer results in enhanced cell growth, migration, and invasion, whereas 
inhibition of MST4 expression significantly attenuates these properties. Further 
study shows that MST4 promotes EMT by activating Akt and its downstream 
signaling molecules such as E-cadherin/N-cadherin, Snail, and Slug. MST4 also 
activates AKT and its downstream pro-survival pathway. Furthermore, by analyzing 
breast cancer patient tissue microarray and silicon datasets, we found that MST4 
expression is much higher in breast tumor tissue compared to normal tissue, and 
significantly correlates with cancer stage, lymph node metastasis and a poor 
overall survival rate (p &lt; 0.05). Taken together, our findings demonstrate 
the oncogenic potential of MST4 in breast cancer, highlighting its role in 
cancer cell proliferation, migration/invasion, survival, and EMT, suggesting a 
possibility that MST4 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer."
1852,"Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a small molecule currently approved and used in the 
treatment of psoriasis and multiple sclerosis due to its immuno-modulatory, 
anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. As an Nrf2 activator through 
Keap1 protein inhibition, DMF unveils a potential therapeutical use that is much 
broader than expected so far. In this comprehensive review we discuss the 
state-of-art and future perspectives regarding the potential repositioning of 
this molecule in the panorama of eye pathologies, including Age-related Macular 
Degeneration (AMD). The DMF's mechanism of action, an extensive analysis of the 
in vitro and in vivo evidence of its beneficial effects, together with a search 
of the current clinical trials, are here reported. Altogether, this evidence 
gives an overview of the new potential applications of this molecule in the 
context of ophthalmological diseases characterized by inflammation and oxidative 
stress, with a special focus on AMD, for which our gene-disease (KEAP1-AMD) 
database search, followed by a protein-protein interaction analysis, further 
supports the rationale of DMF use. The necessity to find a topical route of DMF 
administration to the eye is also discussed. In conclusion, the challenge of DMF 
repurposing in eye pathologies is feasible and worth scientific attention and 
well-focused research efforts."
1853,"Regulation of gene expression takes a central place in normal cells to maintain

1854,"Intrauterine adhesion (IUA) causes menstrual disturbance and infertility. There 
is no effective treatment available for moderate to severe IUA cases. Stem 
cell-based therapy has been investigated for treating IUA but is limited in 
clinical applications due to issues including the precise induction of 
differentiation, tumorigenesis, and unclear molecular mechanisms. In our recent 
study, we isolated and expanded the long-term cultures of conditional 
reprogrammed (CR) mouse endometrial epithelial cells. Treating IUA mice with 
these CR cells (CRCs) restored the morphology and structure of the endometrium 
and significantly improved the pregnancy rate. In this study, our data with 
high-throughput sequencing, CRISPR knockout Ihh-/-CRCs, and transplantation 
identified for the first time that the Indian hedgehog (Ihh) gene plays a 
critical role in the regulation of endometrial epithelial cell proliferation. We 
also found that aberrant activated Ihh-krüppel-like factor 9 (KLF9) signaling 
contributes to the inhibition of normal progesterone receptor (PR) function in 
IUA mice. Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of the Ihh-KLF9 pathway may be a 
novel strategy to treat IUA. Our data demonstrated that treatment with the 
hedgehog signaling inhibitor Vismodegib restored the morphology, structure, and 
microenvironment of the endometrium, and greatly improved the pregnancy rate in 
IUA mice. This study suggests a promising application of hedgehog inhibitors as 
a targeted drug in the IUA clinic."
1855,"We have previously shown that skeletal muscle-derived Sca-1+/PW1+/Pax7- 
interstitial cells (PICs) are multi-potent and enhance endogenous repair and 
regeneration. Here, we investigated the regenerative potential of PICs following 
intramyocardial transplantation in mice subjected to an acute myocardial 
infarction (MI). MI was induced through the ligation of the left anterior 
descending coronary artery in 8-week old male C57BL/6 mice. 5 × 105 
eGFP-labelled PICs (MI + PICs; n = 7) or PBS (MI-PBS; n = 7) were injected 
intramyocardially into the border zone. Sham mice (n = 8) were not subjected to 
MI, or the transplantation of PICs or PBS. BrdU was administered via osmotic 
mini-pump for 14 days. Echocardiography was performed prior to surgery 
(baseline), and 1-, 3- and 6-weeks post-MI and PICs transplantation. Mice were 
sacrificed at 6 weeks post-MI + PICs transplantation, and heart sections were 
analysed for fibrosis, hypertrophy, engraftment, proliferation, and 
differentiation of PICs. A significant (p &lt; 0.05) improvement in ejection 
fraction (EF) and fractional shortening was observed in the MI-PICs group, 
compared to MI + PBS group at 6-weeks post MI + PICs transplantation. Infarct 
size/fibrosis of the left ventricle significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased in the 
MI-PICs group (14.0 ± 2.5%), compared to the MI-PBS group (32.8 ± 2.2%). 
Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in the border zone significantly (p &lt; 0.05) 
decreased in the MI-PICs group compared to the MI-PBS group (330.0 ± 28.5 µM2 
vs. 543.5 ± 26.6 µm2), as did cardiomyocyte apoptosis (0.6 ± 0.9% MI-PICs vs. 
2.8 ± 0.8% MI-PBS). The number of BrdU+ cardiomyocytes was significantly (p &lt; 
0.05) increased in the infarct/border zone of the MI-PICs group (7.0 ± 3.3%), 
compared to the MI-PBS group (1.7 ± 0.5%). The proliferation index (total BrdU+ 
cells) was significantly increased in the MI-PICs group compared to the MI-PBS 
group (27.0 ± 3.4% vs. 7.6 ± 1.0%). PICs expressed and secreted pro-survival and 
reparative growth factors, supporting a paracrine effect of PICs during 
recovery/remodeling. Skeletal muscle-derived PICs show significant reparative 
potential, attenuating cardiac remodelling following transplantation into the 
infarcted myocardium. PICs can be easily sourced from skeletal muscle and 
therefore show promise as a potential cell candidate for supporting the 
reparative and regenerative effects of cell therapies."
1856,"Fifth lumbar (L5) nerve injury in rodent produces neuropathic manifestations in 
the corresponding hind paw. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect 
of cutaneous injection of resiniferatoxin (RTX), a TRPV1 receptor agonist, in 
the rat's hind paw on the neuropathic pain induced by L5 nerve injury. The 
results showed that intraplantar injection of RTX (0.002%, 100 µL) (1) 
completely reversed the development of chronic thermal and mechanical 
hypersensitivity; (2) completely prevented the development of 
nerve-injury-induced thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity when applied one 
week earlier; (3) caused downregulation of nociceptive pain markers, including 
TRPV1, IB4 and CGRP, and upregulation of VIP in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of 
spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) immunohistochemically and a 
significant reduction in the expression of TRPV1 mRNA and protein in the 
ipsilateral DRG using Western blot and qRT-PCR techniques; (4) caused 
downregulation of PGP 9.5- and CGRP-immunoreactivity in the injected skin; (5) 
produced significant suppression of c-fos expression, as a neuronal activity 
marker, in the spinal neurons in response to a second intraplantar RTX injection 
two weeks later. This work identifies the ability of cutaneous injection of RTX 
to completely alleviate and prevent the development of different types of 
neuropathic pain in animals and humans."
1857,"Clonal heterogeneity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) forms the basis for 
treatment failure and relapse. Attempts to decipher clonal evolution and clonal 
competition primarily depend on deep sequencing approaches. However, this 
prevents the experimental confirmation of the identified disease-relevant traits 
on the same cell material. Here, we describe the development and application of 
a complex fluorescent genetic barcoding (cFGB) lentiviral vector system for the 
labeling and subsequent multiplex tracking of up to 48 viable AML clones by flow 
cytometry. This approach allowed the visualization of longitudinal changes in 
the in vitro growth behavior of multiplexed color-coded AML clones for up to 137 
days. Functional studies of flow cytometry-enriched clones documented their 
stably inherited increase in competitiveness, despite the absence of 
growth-promoting mutations in exome sequencing data. Transplantation of aliquots 
of a color-coded AML cell mix into mice revealed the initial engraftment of 
similar clones and their subsequent differential distribution in the animals 
over time. Targeted RNA-sequencing of paired pre-malignant and de novo expanded 
clones linked gene sets associated with Myc-targets, embryonic stem cells, and 
RAS signaling to the foundation of clonal expansion. These results demonstrate 
the potency of cFGB-mediated clonal tracking for the deconvolution of verifiable 
driver-mechanisms underlying clonal selection in leukemia."
1858,"Epigenetic clocks were initially developed to track chronological age, but 
accumulating evidence indicates that they can also predict biological age. They 
are usually based on the analysis of DNA methylation by genome-wide methods, but 
targeted approaches, based on the assessment of a small number of CpG sites, are 
advisable in several settings. In this study, we developed a targeted epigenetic 
clock purposely optimized for the measurement of biological age. The clock 
includes six genomic regions mapping in ELOVL2, NHLRC1, AIM2, EDARADD, SIRT7 and 
TFAP2E genes, selected from a re-analysis of existing microarray data, whose DNA 
methylation is measured by EpiTYPER assay. In healthy subjects (n = 278), 
epigenetic age calculated using the targeted clock was highly correlated with 
chronological age (Spearman correlation = 0.89). Most importantly, and in 
agreement with previous results from genome-wide clocks, epigenetic age was 
significantly higher and lower than expected in models of increased (persons 
with Down syndrome, n = 62) and decreased (centenarians, n = 106; centenarians' 
offspring, n = 143; nutritional intervention in elderly, n = 233) biological 
age, respectively. These results support the potential of our targeted 
epigenetic clock as a new marker of biological age and open its evaluation in 
large cohorts to further promote the assessment of biological age in healthcare 
practice."
1859,"Feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) has been shown to alter phenotypic and metabolic 
parameters in Drosophila melanogaster. However, the impact of fat quantity and 
quality remains uncertain. We first used butterfat (BF) as an example to 
investigate the effects of increasing dietary fat content (3-12%) on male and 
female fruit flies. Although body weight and body composition were not altered 
by any BF concentration, health parameters, such as lifespan, fecundity and 
larval development, were negatively affected in a dose-dependent manner. When 
fruit flies were fed various 12% HFDs (BF, sunflower oil, olive oil, linseed 
oil, fish oil), their fatty acid profiles shifted according to the dietary fat 
qualities. Moreover, fat quality was found to determine the effect size of the 
response to an HFD for traits, such as lifespan, climbing activity, or 
fertility. Consistently, we also found a highly fat quality-specific 
transcriptional response to three exemplary HFD qualities with a small overlap 
of only 30 differentially expressed genes associated with the immune/stress 
response and fatty acid metabolism. In conclusion, our data indicate that not 
only the fat content but also the fat quality is a crucial factor in terms of 
life-history traits when applying an HFD in D. melanogaster."
1860,"The gene changes for diagnosis and prognosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) still remain unclear. RAC1 was reported to be asso;ciated with the B 
cell receptor signal pathway, but its relations with DLBCL have not yet been 
systematically explored. In this study, we have conducted molecular, 
bioinformatics and clinical analyses by using publicly available data from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Wilcoxon signed-rank test and logistic regression 
were performed to evaluate the association between RAC1 and clinical features in 
patients. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used to examine the 
impacts of RAC1 expression level on overall survival, and a nomogram was 
performed to illustrate the correlation between RAC1 and the risk of DLBCL. Our 
results revealed that the expression level of RAC1 in DLBCL was higher than that 
in normal tissues or lymphadenitis. High-level expression of RAC1 was 
significantly associated with clinical stage, as well as being an independent 
factor affecting overall survival. RAC1 was negatively correlated with Bruton's 
tyrosine kinase (BTK). The association between RAC1 gene expression and the risk 
of DLBCL was presented in a nomogram. In conclusion, RAC1 expression patterns 
may be used to predict the development and prognosis of DLBCL."
1861,"Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorders 
(HSD) are clinically overlapping connective tissue disorders of unknown etiology 
and without any validated diagnostic biomarker and specific therapies. Herein, 
we in-depth characterized the cellular phenotype and gene expression profile of 
hEDS and HSD dermal fibroblasts by immunofluorescence, amplicon-based RNA-seq, 
and qPCR. We demonstrated that both cell types show a common cellular trait, 
i.e., generalized extracellular matrix (ECM) disarray, myofibroblast 
differentiation, and dysregulated gene expression. Functional enrichment and 
pathway analyses clustered gene expression changes in different biological 
networks that are likely relevant for the disease pathophysiology. Specifically, 
the complex gene expression dysregulation (mainly involving growth factors, 
structural ECM components, ECM-modifying enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, and 
different signal transducers), is expected to perturb many ECM-related processes 
including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Based on 
these findings, we propose a disease model in which an unbalanced ECM remodeling 
triggers a vicious cycle with a synergistic contribution of ECM degradation 
products and proinflammatory mediators leading to a functional impairment of 
different connective tissues reflecting the multisystemic presentation of 
hEDS/HSD patients. Our results offer many promising clues for translational 
research aimed to define molecular bases, diagnostic biomarkers, and specific 
therapies for these challenging connective tissue disorders."
1862,"In advanced metastatic cancers with reduced patient survival and poor prognosis, 
expression of vimentin, a type III intermediate filament protein is frequently 
observed. Vimentin appears to suppress epithelial characteristics and augments 
cell migration but the molecular basis for these changes is not well understood. 
Here, we have ectopically expressed vimentin in MCF-7 and investigated its 
genomic and functional implications. Vimentin changed the cell shape by 
decreasing major axis, major axis angle and increased cell migration, without 
affecting proliferation. Vimentin downregulated major keratin genes KRT8, KRT18 
and KRT19. Transcriptome-coupled GO and KEGG analyses revealed that 
vimentin-affected genes were linked to either cell-cell/cell-ECM or cell 
cycle/proliferation specific pathways. Using shRNA mediated knockdown of 
vimentin in two cell types; MCF-7FV (ectopically expressing) and MDA-MB-231 
(endogenously expressing), we identified a vimentin-specific signature 
consisting of 13 protein encoding genes (CDH5, AXL, PTPRM, TGFBI, CDH10, NES, 
E2F1, FOXM1, CDC45, FSD1, BCL2, KIF26A and WISP2) and two long non-coding RNAs, 
LINC00052 and C15ORF9-AS1. CDH5, an endothelial cadherin, which mediates 
cell-cell junctions, was the most downregulated protein encoding gene. 
Interestingly, downregulation of CDH5 by shRNA significantly increased cell 
migration confirming our RNA-Seq data. Furthermore, presence of vimentin altered 
the lamin expression in MCF-7. Collectively, we demonstrate, for the first time, 
that vimentin in breast cancer cells could change nuclear architecture by 
affecting lamin expression, which downregulates genes maintaining cell-cell 
junctions resulting in increased cell migration."
1863,"Articular cartilage shows limited self-healing ability owing to its low 
cellularity and avascularity. Untreated cartilage defects display an increased 
propensity to degenerate, leading to osteoarthritis (OA). During OA progression, 
articular chondrocytes are subjected to significant alterations in gene 
expression and phenotype, including a shift towards a hypertrophic-like state 
(with the expression of collagen type X, matrix metalloproteinases-13, and 
alkaline phosphatase) analogous to what eventuates during endochondral 
ossification. Present OA management strategies focus, however, exclusively on 
cartilage inflammation and degradation. A better understanding of the 
hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype in OA might give new insights into its 
pathogenesis, suggesting potential disease-modifying therapeutic approaches. 
Recent developments in the field of cellular/molecular biology and tissue 
engineering proceeded in the direction of contrasting the onset of this 
hypertrophic phenotype, but knowledge gaps in the cause-effect of these 
processes are still present. In this review we will highlight the possible 
advantages and drawbacks of using this approach as a therapeutic strategy while 
focusing on the experimental models necessary for a better understanding of the 
phenomenon. Specifically, we will discuss in brief the cellular signaling 
pathways associated with the onset of a hypertrophic phenotype in chondrocytes 
during the progression of OA and will analyze in depth the advantages and 
disadvantages of various models that have been used to mimic it. Afterwards, we 
will present the strategies developed and proposed to impede chondrocyte 
hypertrophy and cartilage matrix mineralization/calcification. Finally, we will 
examine the future perspectives of OA therapeutic strategies."
1864,"(1) Background: Cells infected with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) produce 
subviral particles, termed dense bodies (DBs), both in-vitro and in-vivo. They 
are released from cells, comparable to infectious virions, and are enclosed by a 
membrane that resembles the viral envelope and mediates the entry into cells. To 
date, little is known about how the DB uptake influences the gene expression in 
target cells. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of DBs on 
cells, in the absence of a viral infection. (2) Methods: Mass spectrometry, 
immunoblot analyses, siRNA knockdown, and a CRISPR-CAS9 knockout, were used to 
investigate the changes in cellular gene expression following a DB exposure; (3) 
Results: A number of interferon-regulated genes (IRGs) were upregulated after 
the fibroblasts and endothelial cells were exposed to DBs. This upregulation was 
dependent on the DB entry and mediated by the type I interferon signaling 
through the JAK-STAT pathway. The induction of IRGs was mediated by the sensing 
of the DB-introduced DNA by the pattern recognition receptor cGAS. (4) 
Conclusions: The induction of a strong type I IFN response by DBs is a unique 
feature of the HCMV infection. The release of DBs may serve as a danger signal 
and concomitantly contribute to the induction of a strong, antiviral immune 
response."
1865,"Background: As a fibrotic disease with a high incidence, the pathogenesis of 
hypertrophic scarring is still not fully understood, and the treatment of this 
disease is also challenging. In recent years, human adipose-derived mesenchymal 
stem cells (AD-MSCs) have been considered an effective treatment for 
hypertrophic scars. This study mainly explored whether the therapeutic effect of 
AD-MSCs on hypertrophic scars is associated with oxidative-stress-related 
proteins. Methods: AD-MSCs were isolated from adipose tissues and characterized 
through flow cytometry and a differentiation test. Afterwards, coculture, cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, and migration were detected. Western blotting and a 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were used to detect 
oxidative stress-related genes and protein expression in hypertrophic scar 
fibroblasts (HSFs). Flow cytometry was used to detect reactive oxygen species 
(ROS). A nude mouse animal model was established; the effect of AD-MSCs on 
hypertrophic scars was observed; and hematoxylin and eosin staining, Masson's 
staining, and immunofluorescence staining were performed. Furthermore, the 
content of oxidative-stress-related proteins, including nuclear factor 
erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), B-cell lymphoma 
2(Bcl2), Bcl2-associated X(BAX) and caspase 3, was detected. Results: Our 
results showed that AD-MSCs inhibited HSFs' proliferation and migration and 
promoted apoptosis. Moreover, after coculture, the expression of antioxidant 
enzymes, including HO-1, in HSFs decreased; the content of reactive oxygen 
species increased; and the expression of Nrf2 decreased significantly. In animal 
experiments, we found that, at 14 days after injection of AD-MSCs into human 
hypertrophic scar tissue blocks that were transplanted onto the dorsum of nude 
mice, the weight of the tissue blocks decreased significantly. Hematoxylin and 
eosin staining and Masson's staining demonstrated a rearrangement of collagen 
fibers. We also found that Nrf2 and antioxidant enzymes decreased significantly, 
while apoptotic cells increased after AD-MSC treatment. Conclusions: Our results 
demonstrated that AD-MSCs efficiently cured hypertrophic scars by promoting the 
apoptosis of HSFs and by inhibiting their proliferation and migration, which may 
be related to the inhibition of Nrf2 expression in HSFs, suggesting that AD-MSCs 
may provide an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of 
hypertrophic scars."
1866,"Cholinergic neuronal networks in the hippocampus play a key role in the 
regulation of learning and memory in mammals. Perturbations of these networks, 
in turn, underlie neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms remain 
largely undefined. We have recently demonstrated that an in vitro MEN1 gene 
deletion perturbs nicotinic cholinergic plasticity at the hippocampal 
glutamatergic synapses. Furthermore, MEN1 neuronal conditional knockout in 
freely behaving animals has also been shown to result in learning and memory 
deficits, though the evidence remains equivocal. In this study, using an AVV 
viral vector transcription approach, we provide direct evidence that MEN1 gene 
deletion in the CA1 region of the hippocampus indeed leads to contextual fear 
conditioning deficits in conditional knockout animals. This loss of function 
was, however, recovered when the same animals were re-injected to overexpress 
MEN1. This study provides the first direct evidence for the sufficiency and 
necessity of MEN1 in fear conditioning, and further endorses the role of menin 
in the regulation of cholinergic synaptic machinery in the hippocampus. These 
data underscore the importance of further exploring and revisiting the 
cholinergic hypothesis that underlies neurodegenerative diseases that affect 
learning and memory."
1867,"Dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5) is the most mutated gene in primary 
ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), leading to abnormal cilia ultrastructure and function. 
Few studies have revealed the genetic characteristics and pathogenetic 
mechanisms of PCD caused by DNAH5 mutation. Here, we established a child PCD 
airway organoid directly from the bronchoscopic biopsy of a patient with the 
DNAH5 mutation. The motile cilia in the organoid were observed and could be 
stably maintained for an extended time. We further found abnormal ciliary 
function and a decreased immune response caused by the DNAH5 mutation through 
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and proteomic analyses. Additionally, the 
directed induction of the ciliated cells, regulated by TGF-β/BMP and the Notch 
pathway, also increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Taken 
together, these results demonstrated that the combination of multiomics analysis 
and organoid modelling could reveal the close connection between the immune 
response and the DNAH5 gene."
1868,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a cell therapy to repair cartilage 
defects. In ACI a biopsy is taken from a non-load bearing area of the knee and 
expanded in-vitro. The expansion process provides the benefit of generating a 
large number of cells required for implantation; however, during the expansion 
these cells de-differentiate and lose their chondrocyte phenotype. In this 
review we focus on examining the de-differentiation phenotype from a 
mechanobiology and biophysical perspective, highlighting some of the nuclear 
mechanics and chromatin changes in chondrocytes seen during the expansion 
process and how this relates to the gene expression profile. We propose that 
manipulating chondrocyte nuclear architecture and chromatin organization will 
highlight mechanisms that will help to preserve the chondrocyte phenotype."
1869,"Steroid receptor RNA activator gene (SRA1) emerges as a player in 
pathophysiological responses of adipose tissue (AT) in metabolic disorders such 
as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We previously showed association of the AT 
SRA1 expression with inflammatory cytokines/chemokines involved in metabolic 
derangement. However, the relationship between altered adipose expression of 
SRA1 and the innate immune Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as players in nutrient 
sensing and metabolic inflammation as well as their downstream signaling 
partners, including interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), remains elusive. 
Herein, we investigated the association of AT SRA1 expression with TLRs, IRFs, 
and other TLR-downstream signaling mediators in a cohort of 108 individuals, 
classified based on their body mass index (BMI) as persons with normal-weight (N 
= 12), overweight (N = 32), and obesity (N = 64), including 55 with and 53 
without T2D. The gene expression of SRA1, TLRs-2,3,4,7,8,9,10 and their 
downstream signaling mediators including IRFs-3,4,5, myeloid differentiation 
factor 88 (MyD88), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), and 
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were determined using qRT-PCR and SRA1 protein 
expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. AT SRA1 transcripts' 
expression was significantly correlated with TLRs-3,4,7, MyD88, NF-κB, and IRF5 
expression in individuals with T2D, while it associated with TLR9 and TRAF6 
expression in all individuals, with/without T2D. SRA1 expression associated with 
TLR2, IRAK1, and IRF3 expression only in individuals with obesity, regardless of 
diabetes status. Furthermore, TLR3/TLR7/IRAK1 and TLR3/TLR9 were identified as 
independent predictors of AT SRA1 expression in individuals with obesity and 
T2D, respectively. Overall, our data demonstrate a direct association between 
the AT SRA1 expression and the TLRs together with their downstream signaling 
partners and IRFs in individuals with obesity and/or T2D."
1870,"The VosA-VelB hetero-dimeric complex plays a pivotal role in regulating 
development and secondary metabolism in Aspergillus nidulans. In this work, we 
characterize a new VosA/VelB-activated gene called vadH, which is predicted to 
encode a 457-amino acid length protein containing four adjacent C2H2 zinc-finger 
domains. Mutational inactivation of vosA or velB led to reduced mRNA levels of 
vadH throughout the lifecycle, suggesting that VosA and VelB have a positive 
regulatory effect on the expression of vadH. The deletion of vadH resulted in 
decreased asexual development (conidiation) but elevated production of sexual 
fruiting bodies (cleistothecia), indicating that VadH balances asexual and 
sexual development in A. nidulans. Moreover, the vadH deletion mutant exhibited 
elevated susceptibility to hyperosmotic stress compared to wild type and showed 
elevated production of the mycotoxin sterigmatocystin (ST). Genome-wide 
expression analyses employing RNA-Seq have revealed that VadH is likely involved 
in regulating more genes and biological pathways in the developmental stages 
than those in the vegetative growth stage. The brlA, abaA, and wetA genes of the 
central regulatory pathway for conidiation are downregulated significantly in 
the vadH null mutant during asexual development. VadH also participates in 
regulating the genes, mat2, ppgA and lsdA, etc., related to sexual development, 
and some of the genes in the ST biosynthetic gene cluster. In summary, VadH is a 
putative transcription factor with four C2H2 finger domains and is involved in 
regulating asexual/sexual development, osmotic stress response, and ST 
production in A. nidulans."
1871,"Bone cement containing benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as a polymerization initiator are 
commonly used to fix orthopedic metal implants. However, toxic complications 
caused by bone cement are a clinically significant problem. Poly (methyl 
methacrylate) tri-n-butylborane (PMMA-TBB), a newly developed material 
containing TBB as a polymerization initiator, was found to be more biocompatible 
than conventional PMMA-BPO bone cements due to reduced free radical generation 
during polymerization. However, free radicals might not be the only determinant 
of cytotoxicity. Here, we evaluated the response and functional phenotypes of 
cells exposed to extracts derived from different bone cements. Bone cement 
extracts were prepared from two commercial PMMA-BPO cements and an experimental 
PMMA-TBB. Rat bone marrow-derived osteoblasts and osteoclasts were cultured in a 
medium supplemented with bone cement extracts. More osteoblasts survived and 
attached to the culture dish with PMMA-TBB extract than in the culture with 
PMMA-BPO extracts. Osteoblast proliferation and differentiation were higher in 
the culture with PMMA-TBB extract. The number of TRAP-positive multinucleated 
cells was significantly lower in the culture with PMMA-TBB extract. There was no 
difference in osteoclast-related gene expression in response to different bone 
cement extracts. In conclusion, PMMA-TBB extract was less toxic to osteoblasts 
than PMMA-BPO extracts. Although extracts from the different cement types did 
not affect osteoclast function, PMMA-TBB extract seemed to reduce 
osteoclastogenesis, a possible further advantage of PMMA-TBB cement. These 
implied that the reduced radical generation during polymerization is not the 
only determinant for the improved biocompatibility of PMMA-TBB and that the 
post-polymerization chemical elution may also be important."
1872,"OBJECTIVE: Glioma is the most common primary malignancy of the adult central 
nervous system (CNS), with a poor prognosis and no effective prognostic 
signature. Since late 2019, the world has been affected by the rapid spread of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Research on SARS-CoV-2 is flourishing; however, its 
potential mechanistic association with glioma has rarely been reported. The aim 
of this study was to investigate the potential correlation of SARS-CoV-2-related 
genes with the occurrence, progression, prognosis, and immunotherapy of gliomas.
METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-related genes were obtained from the human protein atlas 
(HPA), while transcriptional data and clinicopathological data were obtained 
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) 
databases. Glioma samples were collected from surgeries with the knowledge of 
patients. Differentially expressed genes were then identified and screened, and 
seven SARS-CoV-2 related genes were generated by LASSO regression analysis and 
uni/multi-variate COX analysis. A prognostic SARS-CoV-2-related gene signature 
(SCRGS) was then constructed based on these seven genes and validated in the 
TCGA validation cohort and CGGA cohort. Next, a nomogram was established by 
combining critical clinicopathological data. The correlation between SCRGS and 
glioma related biological processes was clarified by Gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA). In addition, immune infiltration and immune score, as well as 
immune checkpoint expression and immune escape, were further analyzed to assess 
the role of SCRGS in glioma-associated immune landscape and the responsiveness 
of immunotherapy. Finally, the reliability of SCRGS was verified by quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on glioma samples.
RESULTS: The prognostic SCRGS contained seven genes, REEP6, CEP112, LARP4B, 
CWC27, GOLGA2, ATP6AP1, and ERO1B. Patients were divided into high- and low-risk 
groups according to the median SARS-CoV-2 Index. Overall survival was 
significantly worse in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. COX 
analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated 
excellent predictive power for SCRGS for glioma prognosis. In addition, GSEA, 
immune infiltration, and immune scores indicated that SCRGS could potentially 
predict the tumor microenvironment, immune infiltration, and immune response in 
glioma patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The SCRGS established here can effectively predict the prognosis of 
glioma patients and provide a potential direction for immunotherapy."
1873,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible cellular program that 
transiently places epithelial (E) cells into pseudo-mesenchymal (M) cell states. 
The malignant progression and resistance of many carcinomas depend on EMT 
activation, partial EMT, or hybrid E/M status in neoplastic cells. EMT is 
activated by tumor microenvironmental TGFβ signal and EMT-inducing transcription 
factors, such as ZEB1/2, in tumor cells. However, reverse EMT factors are less 
studied. We demonstrate that prostate epithelial transcription factor SCAND1 can 
reverse the cancer cell mesenchymal and hybrid E/M phenotypes to a more 
epithelial, less invasive status and inhibit their proliferation and migration 
in DU-145 prostate cancer cells. SCAND1 is a SCAN domain-containing protein and 
hetero-oligomerizes with SCAN-zinc finger transcription factors, such as MZF1, 
for accessing DNA and the transcriptional co-repression of target genes. We 
found that SCAND1 expression correlated with maintaining epithelial features, 
whereas the loss of SCAND1 was associated with mesenchymal phenotypes of tumor 
cells. SCAND1 and MZF1 were mutually inducible and coordinately included in 
chromatin with hetero-chromatin protein HP1γ. The overexpression of SCAND1 
reversed hybrid E/M status into an epithelial phenotype with E-cadherin and 
β-catenin relocation. Consistently, the co-expression analysis in TCGA PanCancer 
Atlas revealed that SCAND1 and MZF1 expression was negatively correlated with 
EMT driver genes, including CTNNB1, ZEB1, ZEB2 and TGFBRs, in prostate 
adenocarcinoma specimens. In addition, SCAND1 overexpression suppressed tumor 
cell proliferation by reducing the MAP3K-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Of note, in 
a mouse tumor xenograft model, SCAND1 overexpression significantly reduced 
Ki-67(+) and Vimentin(+) tumor cells and inhibited migration and lymph node 
metastasis of prostate cancer. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed high expression of 
SCAND1 and MZF1 to correlate with better prognoses in pancreatic cancer and head 
and neck cancers, although with poorer prognosis in kidney cancer. Overall, 
these data suggest that SCAND1 induces expression and coordinated 
heterochromatin-binding of MZF1 to reverse the hybrid E/M status into an 
epithelial phenotype and, inhibits tumor cell proliferation, migration, and 
metastasis, potentially by repressing the gene expression of EMT drivers and the 
MAP3K-MEK-ERK signaling pathway."
1874,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified the PICALM 
(Phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin-assembly protein) gene as the most 
significant genetic susceptibility locus after APOE and BIN1. PICALM is a 
clathrin-adaptor protein that plays a critical role in clathrin-mediated 
endocytosis and autophagy. Since the effects of genetic variants of PICALM as 
AD-susceptibility loci have been confirmed by independent genetic studies in 
several distinct cohorts, there has been a number of in vitro and in vivo 
studies attempting to elucidate the underlying mechanism by which PICALM 
modulates AD risk. While differential modulation of APP processing and Aβ 
transcytosis by PICALM has been reported, significant effects of PICALM 
modulation of tau pathology progression have also been evidenced in Alzheimer's 
disease models. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about PICALM, 
its physiological functions, genetic variants, post-translational modifications 
and relevance to AD pathogenesis."
1875,"DNA methylation is a part of the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression, 
including chromatin remodeling and the activity of microRNAs, which are involved 
in the regulation of T-cell differentiation and function. However, the role of 
cfDNA methylation in T-cell differentiation is entirely unknown. In patients 
with endometrial polyps (EPs), we have found an imbalance of T-cell 
differentiation and an aberrant cfDNA methylation profile, respectively. In this 
study, we investigated the relationship between cfDNA methylation profiles and 
T-cell differentiation in 14 people with EPs and 27 healthy controls. We found 
that several differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were associated with T-cell 
differentiation in people with EPs (ITGA2-Naïve CD4, r = -0.560, p = 0.037; 
CST9-EMRA CD4, r = -0.626, p = 0.017; and ZIM2-CM CD8, r = 0.576, p = 0.031), 
but not in healthy controls (all p &gt; 0.05). When we combined the patients' 
characteristics, we found a significant association between ITGA2 methylation 
and polyp diameter (r = 0.562, p = 0.036), but this effect was lost when 
adjusting the level of Naïve CD4 T-cells (r = 0.038, p = 0.903). Moreover, the 
circulating sex hormone levels were associated with T-cell differentiation 
(estradiol-Naïve CD4, r = -0.589, p = 0.027), and the cfDNA methylation profile 
(testosterone-ZIM2, r = -0.656, p = 0.011). In conclusion, this study has 
established a link between cfDNA methylation profiles and T-cell differentiation 
among people with EPs, which may contribute to the etiology of EPs. Further 
functional studies are warranted."
1876,"The interaction between the dermal papilla cells (DPCs) and epidermal hair 
matrix cells (HMCs) of hair follicles (HFs) is crucial for the growth and 
development of HFs, but the molecular mechanism is complex and remains unclear. 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the key signaling molecules for cellular communication. 
In this study, the DPCs and HMCs of yak were isolated and cultured, and the 
differentially expressed mRNA and miRNA were characterized to analyze the 
molecular basis of the interaction between DPCs and HMCs during hair follicle 
(HF) development in yak. The mRNA differential expression and functional 
enrichment analysis revealed that there were significant differences between 
DPCs and HMCs, and they showed the molecular functional characteristics of 
dermal cells and epidermal cells, respectively. Multiple KEGG pathways related 
to HF development were enriched in the highly expressed genes in DPCs, while the 
pathways associated with microbiota and immunity were significantly enriched in 
the highly expressed genes in HMCs. By combining analysis with our previous 10× 
genomics single-cell transcriptome data, 39 marker genes of DPCs of yak were 
identified. A total of 123 relatively specifically expressed miRNAs were 
screened; among these, the miRNAs associated with HF development such as 
miR-143, miR-214, miR-125b, miR-31, and miR-200 were presented. In conclusion, 
the large changes in yak DPCs and HMCs for both mRNA and miRNA expression were 
revealed, and numerous specifically expressed mRNAs and miRNAs in DPCs or HMCs 
were identified, which may contribute to the interaction and cellular 
communication between DPCs and HMCs during HF development in yak."
1877,"Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders (PBD) and Zellweger syndrome spectrum disorders 
(ZSD) are rare genetic multisystem disorders that include hearing impairment and 
are associated with defects in peroxisome assembly, function, or both. Mutations 
in 13 peroxin (PEX) genes have been found to cause PBD-ZSD with ~70% of patients 
harboring mutations in PEX1. Limited research has focused on the impact of 
peroxisomal disorders on auditory function. As sensory hair cells are 
particularly vulnerable to metabolic changes, we hypothesize that mutations in 
PEX1 lead to oxidative stress affecting hair cells of the inner ear, 
subsequently resulting in hair cell degeneration and hearing loss. Global 
deletion of the Pex1 gene is neonatal lethal in mice, impairing any postnatal 
studies. To overcome this limitation, we created conditional knockout mice (cKO) 
using Gfi1Creor VGlut3Cre expressing mice crossed to floxed Pex1 mice to allow 
for selective deletion of Pex1 in the hair cells of the inner ear. We find that 
Pex1 excision in inner hair cells (IHCs) leads to progressive hearing loss 
associated with significant decrease in auditory brainstem responses (ABR), 
specifically ABR wave I amplitude, indicative of synaptic defects. Analysis of 
IHC synapses in cKO mice reveals a decrease in ribbon synapse volume and 
functional alterations in exocytosis. Concomitantly, we observe a decrease in 
peroxisomal number, indicative of oxidative stress imbalance. Taken together, 
these results suggest a critical function of Pex1 in development and maturation 
of IHC-spiral ganglion synapses and auditory function."
1878,"The effects of the quality of light on the content of phytochrome interacting 
factors (PIFs) such as PIF3, PIF4 and PIF5, as well as the expression of various 
light-dependent microRNAs, in adult Arabidopsis thaliana pif mutant plants 
(pif4, pif5, pif3pif5, pif4pif5, pif3pif4pif5) were studied. We demonstrate that 
under blue light, the pif4 mutant had maximal expression of most of the studied 
microRNAs (miR163, miR319, miR398, miR408, miR833) when the PIF4 protein in 
plants was reduced. This finding indicates that the PIF4 protein is involved in 
the downregulation of this group of microRNAs. This assumption is additionally 
confirmed by the fact that under the RL spectrum in pif5 mutants, practically 
the same miRNAs decrease expression against the background of an increase in the 
amount of PIF4 protein. Unlike the WT and other mutants, the pif4 mutant 
responded to the BL spectrum not only by activating the expression of 
light-dependent miRNAs, but also by a significant increase in the expression of 
transcription factors and key light signalling genes. These molecular reactions 
do not affect the activity of photosynthesis but may be involved in the 
formation of a light quality-dependent phenotype."
1879,"Current treatments for lower-grade glioma (LGG) do not effectively improve life 
expectancy rates, and this is a major global health concern. Improving our 
knowledge of this disease will ultimately help to improve prevention, accurate 
prognosis, and treatment strategies. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of 
regulated cell death, which plays an important role in tumor progression and 
occurrence. There is still a lack of effective markers to evaluate the prognosis 
of LGG patients. We collected paraffin-embedded tissue samples and prognostic 
information from 85 patients with low-grade gliomas and fabricated them into a 
tissue microarray. Combining data from public databases, we explored the 
relationship between pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) and the prognoses of 
patients with LGG and investigated their correlations with the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) by means of machine learning, single-cell, 
immunohistochemical, nomogram, GSEA, and Cox regression analyses. We developed a 
six-gene PRG-based prognostic model, and the results have identified CASP4 as an 
effective marker for LGG prognosis predictions. Furthermore, the effects on 
immune cell infiltration may also provide guidance for future immunotherapy 
strategies."
1880,"BACKGROUND: During aging, muscle cell apoptosis increases and myogenesis 
gradually declines. The impaired myogenic and survival potential of the aged 
skeletal muscle can be ameliorated by its mechanical loading. However, the 
molecular responses of aged muscle cells to mechanical loading remain unclear. 
This study examined the effect of mechanical loading of aged, proliferating, and 
differentiated myoblasts on the gene expression and signaling responses 
associated with their myogenic lineage progression and survival.
METHODS: Control and aged C2C12 cells were cultured on elastic membranes and 
underwent passive stretching for 12 h at a low frequency (0.25 Hz) and different 
elongations, varying the strain on days 0 and 10 of myoblast differentiation. 
Activation of ERK1/2 and Akt, and the expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 
and key myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), MyoD and Myogenin, were determined 
by immunoblotting of the cell lysates derived from stretched and non-stretched 
myoblasts. Changes in the expression levels of the MRFs, muscle growth, atrophy, 
and pro-apoptotic factors in response to mechanical loading of the aged and 
control cells were quantified by real-time qRT-PCR.
RESULTS: Mechanical stretching applied on myoblasts resulted in the upregulation 
of FAK both in proliferating (day 0) and differentiated (day 10) cells, as well 
as in increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both control and aged cells. 
Moreover, Akt activation and the expression of early differentiation factor MyoD 
increased significantly after stretching only in the control myoblasts, while 
the late differentiation factor Myogenin was upregulated in both the control and 
aged myoblasts. At the transcriptional level, mechanical loading of the 
proliferating myoblasts led to an increased expression of IGF-1 isoforms and 
MRFs, and to downregulation of muscle atrophy factors mainly in control cells, 
as well as in the upregulation of pro-apoptotic factors both in control and aged 
cells. In differentiated cells, mechanical loading resulted in an increased 
expression of the IGF-1Ea isoform and Myogenin, and in the downregulation of 
atrophy and pro-apoptotic factors in both the control and aged cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a diminished beneficial effect of mechanical 
loading on the myogenic and survival ability of the senescent muscle cells 
compared with the controls, with a low strain (2%) loading being most effective 
in upregulating myogenic/anabolic factors and downregulating atrophy and 
pro-apoptotic genes mainly in the aged myotubes."
1881,"Spermatogenesis is a complex and continuous process of germ-cell 
differentiation. This complex process is regulated by many factors, of which 
gene regulation in spermatogenic cells plays a decisive role. Spermatogenesis 
has been widely studied in vertebrates, but little is known about 
spermatogenesis in protochordates. Here, for the first time, we performed 
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on 6832 germ cells from the testis of 
adult Ciona intestinalis. We identified six germ cell populations and revealed 
dynamic gene expression as well as transcriptional regulation during 
spermatogenesis. In particular, we identified four spermatocyte subtypes and key 
genes involved in meiosis in C. intestinalis. There were remarkable similarities 
and differences in gene expression during spermatogenesis between C. 
intestinalis and two other vertebrates (Chinese tongue sole and human). We 
identified many spermatogenic-cell-specific genes with functions that need to be 
verified. These findings will help to further improve research on 
spermatogenesis in chordates."
1882,"Atherosclerosis (AS) is a lipid-induced, chronic inflammatory, autoimmune 
disease affecting multiple arteries. Although much effort has been put into AS 
research in the past decades, it is still the leading cause of death worldwide. 
The complex genetic network regulation underlying the pathogenesis of AS still 
needs further investigation to provide effective targeted therapy for AS. We 
performed a bioinformatic microarray data analysis at different atherosclerotic 
plaque stages from the Gene Expression Omnibus database with accession numbers 
GSE43292 and GSE28829. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we further confirmed 
the immune-related pathways that play an important role in the development of 
AS. We are reporting, for the first time, that the metabolism of the three 
branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and 
short-chain fatty acids (SCFA; propanoate, and butanoate) are involved in the 
progression of AS using microarray data of atherosclerotic plaque tissue. Immune 
and muscle system-related pathways were further confirmed as highly regulated 
pathways during the development of AS using gene expression pattern analysis. 
Furthermore, we also identified four modules mainly involved in histone 
modification, immune-related processes, macroautophagy, and B cell activation 
with modular differential connectivity in the dataset of GSE43292, and three 
modules related to immune-related processes, B cell activation, and nuclear 
division in the dataset of GSE28829 also display modular differential 
connectivity based on the weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Finally, 
we identified eight key genes related to the pathways of immune and muscle 
system function as potential therapeutic biomarkers to distinguish patients with 
early or advanced stages in AS, and two of the eight genes were validated using 
the gene expression dataset from gene-deficient mice. The results of the current 
study will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms in the 
progression of AS. The key genes and pathways identified could be potential 
biomarkers or new drug targets for AS management."
1883,"Gene-modified miniature pigs serve as alternative tissue and organ donors for 
xenotransplantation to alleviate the shortage of human allogenic organs. 
However, the high copy number of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) genomes 
integrates with the porcine genome, which has a potential risk of cross-species 
transmission and hinders the clinical practice of xenotransplantation. Recently, 
CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to inactivate PERVs. However, Cas9 also triggers 
severe DNA damage at multiple integrated PERV sites in the porcine genome, which 
induces senescence and apoptosis of porcine cells. In this study, the cytosine 
base editor (CBE), an efficient and safe editor that does not cause DNA double 
strand breaks (DSBs), was used for PERV editing to reduce cytotoxic effects. 
Seven sgRNAs were set to target gag and pol loci of PERVs to induce premature 
stop codons. We found that approximately 10% of cell clones were completely 
inactivated for PERVs in pig ST cells, and the plasmid that was used for editing 
the PERVs did not integrate into host genome and influence the karyotype of the 
modified cells. Our studies offer a powerful and safe strategy for further 
generating PERV-knockout pigs using base editors."
1884,"Historical standard of care treatments of T-cell malignancies generally entailed 
the use of cytotoxic and depleting approaches. These strategies are, however, 
poorly validated and record dismal long-term outcomes. More recently, the 
introduction and approval of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has 
revolutionized the therapy of B-cell malignancies. Translating this success to 
the T-cell compartment has so far proven hazardous, entangled by risks of 
fratricide, T-cell aplasia, and product contamination by malignant cells. 
Several strategies have been utilized to overcome these challenges. These 
include the targeting of a selective cognate antigen exclusive to T-cells or a 
subset of T-cells, disruption of target antigen expression on CAR-T constructs, 
use of safety switches, non-viral transduction, and the introduction of 
allogeneic compounds and gene editing technologies. We herein overview these 
historical challenges and revisit the opportunities provided as potential 
solutions. An in-depth understanding of the tumor microenvironment is required 
to optimally harness the potential of the immune system to treat T-cell 
malignancies."
1885,"The Myc Network, comprising a small assemblage of bHLH-ZIP transcription 
factors, regulates many hundreds to thousands of genes involved in 
proliferation, energy metabolism, translation and other activities. A 
structurally and functionally related set of factors known as the Mlx Network 
also supervises some of these same functions via the regulation of a more 
limited but overlapping transcriptional repertoire. Target gene co-regulation by 
these two Networks is the result of their sharing of three members that suppress 
target gene expression as well as by the ability of both Network's members to 
cross-bind one another's consensus DNA sites. The two Networks also differ in 
that the Mlx Network's control over transcription is positively regulated by 
several glycolytic pathway intermediates and other metabolites. These 
distinctive properties, functions and tissue expression patterns potentially 
allow for sensitive control of gene regulation in ways that are differentially 
responsive to environmental and metabolic cues while allowing for them to be 
both rapid and of limited duration. This review explores how such control might 
occur. It further discusses how the actual functional dependencies of the Myc 
and Mlx Networks rely upon cellular context and how they may differ between 
normal and neoplastic cells. Finally, consideration is given to how future 
studies may permit a more refined understanding of the functional 
interrelationships between the two Networks."
1886,"The evolutionary conserved NEAT1-MALAT1 gene cluster generates large noncoding 
transcripts remaining nuclear, while tRNA-like transcripts (mascRNA, menRNA) 
enzymatically generated from these precursors translocate to the cytosol. 
Whereas functions have been assigned to the nuclear transcripts, data on 
biological functions of the small cytosolic transcripts are sparse. We 
previously found NEAT1-/- and MALAT1-/- mice to display massive atherosclerosis 
and vascular inflammation. Here, employing selective targeted disruption of 
menRNA or mascRNA, we investigate the tRNA-like molecules as critical components 
of innate immunity. CRISPR-generated human ΔmascRNA and ΔmenRNA 
monocytes/macrophages display defective innate immune sensing, loss of cytokine 
control, imbalance of growth/angiogenic factor expression impacting upon 
angiogenesis, and altered cell-cell interaction systems. Antiviral response, 
foam cell formation/oxLDL uptake, and M1/M2 polarization are defective in 
ΔmascRNA/ΔmenRNA macrophages, defining first biological functions of menRNA and 
describing new functions of mascRNA. menRNA and mascRNA represent novel 
components of innate immunity arising from the noncoding genome. They appear as 
prototypes of a new class of noncoding RNAs distinct from others (miRNAs, 
siRNAs) by biosynthetic pathway and intracellular kinetics. Their NEAT1-MALAT1 
region of origin appears as archetype of a functionally highly integrated RNA 
processing system."
1887,"Canonical Wnt signaling is involved in skeletal muscle cell biology. The exact 
way in which this pathway exerts its contribution to myogenesis or neuromuscular 
junctions (NMJ) is a matter of debate. Next to the common co-receptors of 
canonical Wnt signaling, Lrp5 and Lrp6, the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK was 
reported to bind at NMJs WNT glycoproteins by its extracellular cysteine-rich 
domain. Previously, we reported canonical Wnt signaling being active in fast 
muscle fiber types. Here, we used conditional Lrp5 or Lrp6 knockout mice to 
investigate the role of these receptors in muscle cells. Conditional double 
knockout mice died around E13 likely due to ectopic expression of the Cre 
recombinase. Phenotypes of single conditional knockout mice point to a very 
divergent role for the two receptors. First, muscle fiber type distribution and 
size were changed. Second, canonical Wnt signaling reporter mice suggested less 
signaling activity in the absence of Lrps. Third, expression of several myogenic 
marker genes was changed. Fourth, NMJs were of fragmented phenotype. Fifth, 
recordings revealed impaired neuromuscular transmission. In sum, our data show 
fundamental differences in absence of each of the Lrp co-receptors and suggest a 
differentiated view of canonical Wnt signaling pathway involvement in adult 
skeletal muscle cells."
1888,"Understanding the molecular underpinnings of the evolution of complex 
(multi-part) systems is a fundamental topic in biology. One unanswered question 
is to what the extent do similar or different genes and regulatory interactions 
underlie similar complex systems across species? Animal eyes and 
phototransduction (light detection) are outstanding systems to investigate this 
question because some of the genetics underlying these traits are well 
characterized in model organisms. However, comparative studies using non-model 
organisms are also necessary to understand the diversity and evolution of these 
traits. Here, we compare the characteristics of photoreceptor cells, opsins, and 
phototransduction cascades in diverse taxa, with a particular focus on 
cnidarians. In contrast to the common theme of deep homology, whereby similar 
traits develop mainly using homologous genes, comparisons of visual systems, 
especially in non-model organisms, are beginning to highlight a ""deep diversity"" 
of underlying components, illustrating how variation can underlie similar 
complex systems across taxa. Although using candidate genes from model organisms 
across diversity was a good starting point to understand the evolution of 
complex systems, unbiased genome-wide comparisons and subsequent functional 
validation will be necessary to uncover unique genes that comprise the complex 
systems of non-model groups to better understand biodiversity and its evolution."
1889,"CSNK2 tetrameric holoenzyme is composed of two subunits with catalytic activity 
(CSNK2A1 and/or CSNK2A2) and two regulatory subunits (CSNK2B) and is involved in 
skeletal muscle homeostasis. Up-to-date, constitutive Csnk2a2 knockout mice 
demonstrated mild regenerative impairments in skeletal muscles, while 
conditional Csnk2b mice were linked to muscle weakness, impaired neuromuscular 
transmission, and metabolic and autophagic compromises. Here, for the first 
time, skeletal muscle-specific conditional Csnk2a1 mice were generated and 
characterized. The ablation of Csnk2a1 expression was ensured using a human 
skeletal actin-driven Cre reporter. In comparison with control mice, first, 
conditional knockout of CSNK2A1 resulted in age-dependent reduced grip strength. 
Muscle weakness was accompanied by impaired neuromuscular transmission. Second, 
the protein amount of other CSNK2 subunits was aberrantly changed. Third, the 
number of central nuclei in muscle fibers indicative of regeneration increased. 
Fourth, oxidative metabolism was impaired, reflected by an increase in 
cytochrome oxidase and accumulation of mitochondrial enzyme activity underneath 
the sarcolemma. Fifth, autophagic processes were stimulated. Sixth, NMJs were 
fragmented and accompanied by increased synaptic gene expression levels. 
Altogether, knockout of Csnk2a1 or Csnk2b results in diverse impairments of 
skeletal muscle biology."
1890,"(1) Background: Both sepsis acute lung injury (SALI) and non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) are life-threatening diseases caused by immune response disorders 
and inflammation, but the underlining linking mechanisms are still not clear. 
This study aimed to detect the shared gene signature and potential molecular 
process between SALI and NSCLC. (2) Methods: RNA sequences and patient 
information on sepsis and NSCLC were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to 
build a co-expression network associated with sepsis and NSCLC. Protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) analysis of shared genes was intuitively performed by the 
Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database. 
The involvement of EZH2 in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and sepsis 
immune microenvironment (IME) was assessed by R software. Western blot, flow 
cytometry, and other in vitro assays were performed to further confirm the 
function and mechanism of EZH2 in NSCLC and SALI. (3) Results: WGCNA recognized 
three major modules for sepsis and two major modules for NSCLC, and there were 
seven shared genes identified for the two diseases. Additionally, the hub gene 
EZH2 was screened out. It was shown that EZH2 was closely related to the IME in 
the two diseases. In the validation assay, our data showed that EZH2 was 
expressed at a higher level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 
septic patients than those of healthy donors (HDs), and EZH2 was also expressed 
at a higher level in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PBMCs and non-small cell 
lung cancer (A549) cells. EZH2 inhibitor (GSK343) downregulated the 
proliferation ability of A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, 
parallel with the decreased expression level of PD-L1. Similarly, GSK343 
inhibited PD-L1 protein expression and downregulated the level of 
proinflammatory factors in LPS-induced PBMCs. In the co-culture system of PBMCs 
and human type II alveolar epithelial cells (ATIIs), the addition of GSK343 to 
PBMCs significantly downregulated the apoptosis of LPS-induced ATIIs. (4) 
Conclusions: This study illustrated that EZH2 inhibition could ameliorate A549 
cell proliferation and LPS-induced ATII apoptosis in parallel with 
downregulation of PD-L1 protein expression, which provided new insights into 
molecular signaling networks involved in the pathogenetics of SALI and NSCLC."
1891,"Microglia play a vital role in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effects 
of microglia-derived exosomes on neuronal cells are poorly understood. This 
study aimed to explore the role of M1-polarized microglia exosomes in neuronal 
cells by transcriptome analysis. Exosomes isolated from resting M0-phenotype BV2 
(M0-BV2) microglia and M1-polarized BV2 (M1-BV2) microglia were analyzed using 
high-throughput sequencing of the transcriptome. Differentially expressed genes 
(DEGs) between the two types of exosomes were identified by analyzing the 
sequencing data. The biological functions and pathways regulated by the 
identified DEGs were then identified using bioinformatics analyses. Finally, we 
evaluated the effects of exosomes on neuronal cells by coculturing M0-BV2 and 
M1-BV2 exosomes with primary neuronal cells. Enrichment analyses revealed that 
DEGs were significantly enriched in the ferroptosis pathway (p = 0.0137). M0-BV2 
exosomes had no distinct effects on ferroptosis in neuronal cells, whereas 
M1-BV2 exosomes significantly reduced ferroptosis suppressor proteins (GPX4, 
SLC7A11, and FTH1) and elevated the levels of intracellular and mitochondrial 
ferrous iron and lipid peroxidation in neuronal cells. Polarized M1-BV2 
microglia exosomes can induce ferroptosis in neuronal cells, thereby aggravating 
neuronal damage. Taken together, these findings enhance knowledge of the 
pathogenesis of neurological disorders and suggest potential therapeutic targets 
against neurodegenerative diseases."
1892,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) 6 exists exclusively in cytoplasm and deacetylates 
cytoplasmic proteins such as α-tubulin. HDAC6 dysfunction is associated with 
several pathological conditions in renal disorders, including UUO-induced 
fibrotic kidneys and rhabdomyolysis-induced nephropathy. However, the role of 
HDAC6 in ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) and the mechanism by which HDAC6 
inhibition protects tubular cells after AKI remain unclear. In the present 
study, we observed that HDAC6 was markedly activated in kidneys subjected to 
ischemia- and cisplatin (cis)-induced AKI treatment. Pharmacological inhibition 
of HDAC6 alleviated renal impairment and renal tubular damage after ischemia and 
cisplatin treatment. HDAC6 dysfunction was associated with decreased acetylation 
of α-tubulin at the residue of lysine 40 and autophagy. HDAC6 inhibition 
preserved acetyl-α-tubulin-enhanced autophagy flux in AKI and cultured tubular 
cells. Genetic ablation of the renal tubular (RT) Atg7 gene or pharmacological 
inhibition of autophagy suppressed the protective effects of HDAC6. Taken 
together, our study indicates that HDAC6 contributes to ischemia- and 
cisplatin-induced AKI by inhibiting autophagy and the acetylation of α-tubulin. 
These results suggest that HDAC6 could be a potential target for ischemic and 
nephrotoxic AKI."
1893,"Stargardt disease is an inherited retinal disease caused by biallelic mutations 
in the ABCA4 gene, many of which affect ABCA4 splicing. In this study, nine 
antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) were designed to correct pseudoexon (PE) 
inclusion caused by a recurrent deep-intronic variant in ABCA4 
(c.769-784C&gt;T). First, the ability of AONs to skip the PE from the final 
ABCA4 mRNA transcript was assessed in two cellular models carrying the 
c.769-784C&gt;T variant: a midigene assay using HEK293T cells and 
patient-derived fibroblasts. Based on the splicing-correcting ability of each 
individual AON, the three most efficacious AONs targeting independent regions of 
the PE were selected for a final assessment in photoreceptor precursor cells 
(PPCs). The final analysis in the PPC model confirmed high efficacy of AON2, -5, 
and -7 in promoting PE exclusion. Among the three AONs, AON2 is chosen as the 
lead candidate for further optimization, hereby showcasing the high potential of 
AONs to correct aberrant splicing events driven by deep-intronic variants."
1894,"Folic acid (FA) is a synthetic and highly stable version of folate, while 
6S-5-methyltetrahydrofolate is the predominant form of dietary folate in 
circulation and is used as a crystalline form of calcium salt (MTHF-Ca). The 
current study aims to evaluate the toxicity and safety of FA and MTHF-Ca on 
embryonic development, with a focus on cardiovascular defects. We began to 
analyze the toxicity of FA and MTHF-Ca in zebrafish from four to seventy-two 
hours postfertilization and assessed the efficacy of FA and MTHF-Ca in a 
zebrafish angiogenesis model. We then analyzed the differently expressed genes 
in in vitro fertilized murine blastocysts cultured with FA and MTHF-Ca. By using 
gene-expression profiling, we identified a novel gene in mice that encodes an 
essential eukaryotic translation initiation factor (Eif1ad7). We further applied 
the morpholino-mediated gene-knockdown approach to explore whether the FA 
inhibition of this gene (eif1axb in zebrafish) caused cardiac development 
disorders, which we confirmed with qRT-PCR. We found that FA, but not MTHF-Ca, 
could inhibit angiogenesis in zebrafish and result in abnormal cardiovascular 
development, leading to embryonic death owing to the downregulation of eif1axb. 
MTHF-Ca, however, had no such cardiotoxicity, unlike FA. The current study 
thereby provides experimental evidence that FA, rather than MTHF-Ca, has 
cardiovascular toxicity in early embryonic development and suggests that 
excessive supplementation of FA in perinatal women may be related to the 
potential risk of cardiovascular disorders, such as congenital heart disease."
1895,"In diabetes, chronic hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, inflammation and oxidative 
stress contribute to the progression of macro/microvascular complications. 
Recently, benefits of the use of flavonoids in these conditions have been 
established. This study investigates, in two different mouse models of diabetes, 
the vasculoprotective effects of the synthetic flavonoid hidrosmin on 
endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. In a type 2 diabetes model of 
leptin-receptor-deficient (db/db) mice, orally administered hidrosmin (600 
mg/kg/day) for 16 weeks markedly improved vascular function in aorta and 
mesenteric arteries without affecting vascular structural properties, as 
assessed by wire and pressure myography. In streptozotocin-induced type 1 
diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, hidrosmin treatment for 7 weeks 
reduced atherosclerotic plaque size and lipid content; increased markers of 
plaque stability; and decreased markers of inflammation, senescence and 
oxidative stress in aorta. Hidrosmin showed cardiovascular safety, as neither 
functional nor structural abnormalities were noted in diabetic hearts. Ex vivo, 
hidrosmin induced vascular relaxation that was blocked by nitric oxide synthase 
(NOS) inhibition. In vitro, hidrosmin stimulated endothelial NOS activity and NO 
production and downregulated hyperglycemia-induced inflammatory and oxidant 
genes in vascular smooth muscle cells. Our results highlight hidrosmin as a 
potential add-on therapy in the treatment of macrovascular complications of 
diabetes."
1896,"(1) Background: Senescence represents the final stage of plant growth and 
development, which transfers nutrients to growing seeds and directly affects the 
yield and quality of crops. However, little is known about chlorophyll 
degradation in developing and maturing seeds, in contrast to leaf senescence; 
(2) Methods: RNA-Seq was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes of 
different late-senescent germplasms. A widely untargeted metabolic analysis was 
used to analyze differential metabolites. In addition, qRT-PCR was conducted to 
detect gene expression levels; (3) Results: Transcriptome analysis revealed that 
ZX12 seeds have a higher expression level of the chlorophyll synthesis genes in 
the early stage of maturity, compared with ZX4, and have a lower expression 
level of chlorophyll degradation genes in the late stage of maturity. Flavonoids 
were the primary differential metabolites, and ZX12 contains the unique and 
highest expression of three types of metabolites, including 
farrerol-7-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-o-(6'-o-feruloyl) glucoside, and 
kaempferide-3-o-(6'-malonyl) glucoside. Among them, farrerol-7-O-glucoside and 
cyanidin-3-o-(6'-o-feruloyl) glucoside are flavonoid derivatives containing mono 
and dihydroxy-B-ring chemical structures, respectively; and (4) Conclusions: It 
is speculated that the two metabolites can slow down the degradation process of 
chlorophyll by scavenging oxygen-free radicals in the chloroplast."
1897,"Oxidative stress has been identified as a key mechanism in liver damage caused 
by various chemicals. The transcription factor FOXO3a has emerged as a critical 
regulator of redox imbalance. Multiple post-translational changes and epigenetic 
processes closely regulate the activity of FOXO3a, resulting in synergistic or 
competing impacts on its subcellular localization, stability, protein-protein 
interactions, DNA binding affinity, and transcriptional programs. Depending on 
the chemical nature and subcellular context, the oxidative-stress-mediated 
activation of FOXO3a can induce multiple transcriptional programs that play 
crucial roles in oxidative injury to the liver by chemicals. Here, we mainly 
review the role of FOXO3a in coordinating programs of genes that are essential 
for cellular homeostasis, with an emphasis on exploring the regulatory 
mechanisms and potential application of FOXO3a as a therapeutic target to 
prevent and treat liver oxidative injury."
1898,"Epidemiological studies suggest cigarette smoking as a probable environmental 
factor for a variety of congenital anomalies, including low bone mass, increased 
fracture risk and poor skeletal health. Human and animal in vitro models have 
confirmed hypomineralization of differentiating cell lines with sidestream smoke 
being more harmful to developing cells than mainstream smoke. Furthermore, first 
reports are emerging to suggest a differential impact of conventional versus 
harm-reduction tobacco products on bone tissue as it develops in the embryo or 
in vitro. To gather first insight into the molecular mechanism of such 
differences, we assessed the effect of sidestream smoke solutions from Camel 
(conventional) and Camel Blue (harm-reduction) cigarettes using a human 
embryonic stem cell osteogenic differentiation model. Sidestream smoke from the 
conventional Camel cigarettes concentration-dependently inhibited in vitro 
calcification triggered by high levels of mitochondrially generated oxidative 
stress, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced ATP production. 
Camel sidestream smoke also induced DNA damage and caspase 9-dependent 
apoptosis. Camel Blue-exposed cells, in contrast, invoked only intermediate 
levels of reactive oxygen species insufficient to activate caspase 3/7. Despite 
the absence of apoptotic gene activation, damage to the mitochondrial phenotype 
was still noted concomitant with activation of an anti-inflammatory gene 
signature and inhibited mineralization. Collectively, the presented findings in 
differentiating pluripotent stem cells imply that embryos may exhibit low bone 
mineral density if exposed to environmental smoke during development."
1899,"During systemic inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in the 
bloodstream, producing large amounts of oxidized HDL (oxHDL). OxHDL loses the 
vascular protective features of native HDL, acquiring detrimental actions. 
Systemic inflammation promotes endothelial fibrosis, characterized by adhesion 
protein downregulation and fibrotic-specific gene upregulation, disrupting 
endothelial monolayer integrity. Severe systemic inflammatory conditions, as 
found in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), exhibit 
endothelial hyperpermeability, hypotension, and organ hypoperfusion, promoting 
organ dysfunction and increased mortality. Because endothelial fibrosis disturbs 
the endothelium, it is proposed that it is the cellular and molecular origin of 
endothelial hyperpermeability and the subsequent deleterious consequences. 
However, whether oxHDL is involved in this process is unknown. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the fibrotic effect of oxHDL on the endothelium, to 
elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanism, and to determine its 
effects on vascular permeability, blood pressure, and mortality. The results 
showed that oxHDL induces endothelial fibrosis through the LOX-1/NOX-2/ROS/NF-κB 
pathway, TGF-β secretion, and ALK-5/Smad activation. OxHDL-treated rats showed 
endothelial hyperpermeability, hypotension, and an enhanced risk of death and 
mortality, which was prevented using an ALK-5 inhibitor and antioxidant diet 
consumption. Additionally, the ICU patients showed fibrotic endothelial cells, 
and the resuscitation fluid volume administered correlated with the plasma oxHDL 
levels associated with an elevated risk of death and mortality. We conclude that 
oxHDL generates endothelial fibrosis, impacting blood pressure regulation and 
survival."
1900,"Cigarette smoking-induced oxidative stress has harmful effects on bone 
metabolism. Maqui berry extract (MBE) and ginseng extract (GE) are two naturally 
occurring antioxidants that have been shown to reduce oxidative stress. By using 
an osteoblast and osteoclast three-dimensional co-culture system, we 
investigated the effects of MBE and GE on bone cells exposed to cigarette smoke 
extract (CSE). The cell viability and function of the co-culture system were 
measured on day 14. Markers of bone cell differentiation and oxidative stress 
were evaluated at gene and protein levels on day 7. The results showed that 
exposure to CSE induced osteoporotic-like alterations in the co-culture system, 
while 1.5 µg/mL MBE and 50 µg/mL GE improved CSE-impaired osteoblast function 
and decreased CSE-induced osteoclast function. The molecular mechanism of MBE 
and GE in preventing CSE-induced bone cell damage is linked with the inhibition 
of the NF-κB signaling pathway and the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. 
Therefore, MBE and GE can reduce CSE-induced detrimental effects on bone cells 
and, thus, prevent smoking-induced alterations in bone cell homeostasis. These 
two antioxidants are thus suitable supplements to support bone regeneration in 
smokers."
1901,"Oenanthe javanica, commonly known as water dropwort, has long been used to treat 
acute and chronic hepatitis, abdominal pain, alcohol hangovers, and inflammation 
in various traditional medicine systems in Asia. However, whether O. javanica 
has beneficial effects on colitis-induced intestinal damage remains elusive. 
This study tested the hypothesis that O. javanica has anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidant activities in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced 
colitis. First, treatment of O. javanica ethanol extract (OJE) inhibited the 
production of inflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-affected macrophages. 
Second, in mice with DSS-induced colitis, OJE administration reduced 
pathological damage to the colon while alleviating weight gain and decreasing 
colon length, including inflammation and mucosal necrosis. In addition, OJE 
significantly (p &lt; 0.01) restricted the activation of nuclear factor-κB 
(NF-κB) and the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and increased the 
expression of Nrf2-phase 2 antioxidant enzymes. The results of 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing workflows for taxonomic assignment analysis confirmed that the 
diversity (richness and evenness) of fecal microbiota was markedly elevated in 
the OJE group. OJE administration reduced the abundance of Proteobacteria 
including Escherichia and increased the abundance of the genus Muribaculum. 
These results suggested that OJE exerts beneficial effects on inflammation and 
gut microbial composition in a mouse model of colitis."
1902,"BACKGROUND: CD4+ T cells critically contribute to the initiation and 
perturbation of inflammation. When CD4+ T cells enter inflamed tissues, they 
adapt to hypoxia and oxidative stress conditions, and to a reduction in 
nutrients. We aimed to investigate how this distinct environment regulates T 
cell responses within the inflamed joints of patients with childhood rheumatism 
(JIA) by analyzing the behavior of NRF2-the key regulator of the anti-oxidative 
stress response-and its signaling pathways.
METHODS: Flow cytometry and quantitative RT-PCR were used to perform metabolic 
profiling of T cells and to measure the production of inflammatory cytokines. 
Loss of function analyses were carried out by means of siRNA transfection 
experiments. NRF2 activation was induced by treatment with 4-octyl-Itaconate 
(4-OI).
RESULTS: Flow cytometry analyses revealed a high metabolic status in CD4+ T 
cells taken from synovial fluid (SF) with greater mitochondrial mass, and 
increased glucose and fatty acid uptake. This resulted in a heightened oxidative 
status of SF CD4+ T cells. Despite raised ROS levels, expression of NRF2 and its 
target gene NQO1 were lower in CD4+ T cells from SF than in those from blood. 
Indeed, NRF2 activation of CD4+ T cells downregulated oxidative stress markers, 
altered the metabolic phenotype and reduced secretion of IFN-γ.
CONCLUSION: NRF2 could be a potential regulator in CD4+ T cells during chronic 
inflammation and could instigate a drift toward disease progression or 
regression, depending on the inflammatory environment."
1903,"Decreased selenium (Se) levels during childhood and infancy are associated with 
worse respiratory health. Se is biologically active after incorporation into 
Se-containing antioxidant enzymes (AOE) and proteins. It is unknown how 
decreased maternal Se during pregnancy and lactation impacts neonatal pulmonary 
selenoproteins, growth, and lung development. Using a model of neonatal Se 
deficiency that limits Se intake to the dam during pregnancy and lactation, we 
evaluated which neonatal pulmonary selenoproteins are decreased in both the 
saccular (postnatal day 0, P0) and early alveolar (postnatal day 7, P7) stages 
of lung development. We found that Se deficient (SeD) pups weigh less and 
exhibit impaired alveolar development compared to Se sufficient (SeS) pups at 
P7. The activity levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin 
reductase (Txnrd) were decreased at P0 and P7 in SeD lungs compared to SeS 
lungs. Protein content of GPx1, GPx3 and Txnrd1 were decreased in SeD lungs at 
P0 and P7, whereas Txnrd2 content was unaltered compared to SeS controls. The 
expression of NRF-2 dependent genes and several non-Se containing AOE were 
similar between SeS and SeD lungs. SeD lungs exhibited a decrease in 
selenoprotein N, an endoplasmic reticulum protein implicated in alveolar 
development, at both time points. We conclude that exposure to Se deficiency 
during pregnancy and lactation impairs weight gain and lung growth in offspring. 
Our data identify multiple selenoproteins in the neonatal lung that are 
vulnerable to decreased Se intake, which may impact oxidative stress and cell 
signaling under physiologic conditions as well as after oxidative stressors."
1904,"A 10-week growth trial was conducted to investigate the effects of a phytogenic 
feed additive (PFA) containing olive by-products and green tea extracts 
supplemented to a reduced fishmeal/high soybean meal diet on the growth 
performance, hepatic antioxidant capacity, lipid metabolism, and liver health of 
largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Three experimental diets were tested: 
(1) a control high fishmeal (40%) and low soybean meal (15.57%) diet (named 
HFM), (2) a reduced fishmeal (30%) and high soybean meal (30.97%) diet (named 
HSB), and (3) a HSB diet supplemented with the PFA at 500 mg/kg (named HSB+P). 
Each diet was assigned to four replicate tanks, each containing 30 largemouth 
bass (initial body weight, IBW = 48.33 ± 0.01 g). The results showed that 
increasing the soybean meal content in the diet did not negatively affect growth 
performance, whereas supplementation with PFA significantly increased weight 
gain and specific growth rate of largemouth bass compared to both HFM and HSB 
groups. Reducing fishmeal and increasing soybean meal in the diet caused 
oxidative stress with a higher content of ROS in the liver. However, the hepatic 
antioxidant capacity was enhanced, with reduced ROS and increased GSH-Px levels 
in the HSB+P group. Moreover, the decrease of plasma TG, LDL-C, and LDL-C/TC, 
and downregulation of lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis gene expression in 
liver, indicated that supplementation with the PFA improved fish lipid 
metabolism. Protein retention efficiency was also significantly increased in 
largemouth bass fed the diet with PFA supplementation, which regulated 
(enhanced) AKT-mTOR phosphorylation. These results clearly indicated that a PFA 
containing olive by-product and green tea extracts can positively improve growth 
performance, protein retention efficiency, antioxidant capacity, and lipid 
metabolism of largemouth bass fed a reduced fishmeal/high soybean meal diet."
1905,"Excess alcohol consumption is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular 
diseases and is linked to accelerated aging. Drug discovery to reduce toxic 
cellular events of alcohol is required. Here, we investigated the effects of 
ethanol on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and explored if 
doxycycline attenuates ethanol-mediated molecular events in endothelial cells. 
Initially, a drug screening using a panel of 170 drugs was performed, and 
doxycycline was selected for further experiments. HUVECs were treated with 
different concentrations (300 mM and 400 mM) of ethanol with or without 
doxycycline (10 µg/mL). Telomere length was quantified as telomere to 
single-copy gene (T/S) ratio. Telomere length and the mRNA expression were 
quantified by qRT-PCR, and protein level was analyzed by Western blot (WB). 
Ethanol treatment accelerated cellular aging, and doxycycline treatment 
recovered telomere length. Pathway analysis showed that doxycycline inhibited 
mTOR and NFκ-B activation. Doxycycline restored the expression of 
aging-associated proteins, including lamin b1 and DNA repair proteins KU70 and 
KU80. Doxycycline reduced senescence and senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype (SASP) in ethanol-treated HUVECs. In conclusion, we report that 
ethanol-induced inflammation and aging in HUVECs were ameliorated by 
doxycycline."
1906,"Photosynthesis is an important plant metabolic mechanism that improves carbon 
absorption and crop yield. Photosynthetic efficiency is greatly hampered by cold 
stress (CS). Melatonin (ME) is a new plant growth regulator that regulates a 
wide range of abiotic stress responses. However, the molecular mechanism of 
ME-mediated photosynthetic regulation in cold-stressed plants is not well 
understood. Our findings suggest that under low-temperature stress (15/5 °C for 
7 days), spraying the plant with ME (200 µM) enhanced gas exchange 
characteristics and the photosynthetic pigment content of pepper seedlings, as 
well as upregulated their biosynthetic gene expression. Melatonin increased the 
activity of photosynthetic enzymes (Rubisco and fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase) 
while also enhancing starch, sucrose, soluble sugar, and glucose content under 
CS conditions. Low-temperature stress significantly decreased the photochemical 
activity of photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI), specifically their 
maximum quantum efficiency PSII (Fv/Fm) and PSI (Pm). In contrast, ME treatment 
improved the photochemical activity of PSII and PSI. Furthermore, CS 
dramatically reduced the actual PSII efficiency (ΦPSII), electron transport rate 
(ETR) and photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), while enhancing 
nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ); however, ME treatment substantially mitigated 
the effects of CS. Our results clearly show the probable function of ME 
treatment in mitigating the effects of CS by maintaining photosynthetic 
performance, which might be beneficial when screening genotypes for CS 
tolerance."
1907,"BACKGROUND: Autophagy can confer protection to pancreatic β-cells from the 
harmful effects of metabolic stress by delaying apoptosis. Curcumin (CUR) 
alleviates oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, activates autophagy, 
reduces inflammation, and decreases β-cell damage in type I diabetes. Liposomal 
CUR (LPs-CUR) has a higher therapeutic value and better pharmacokinetics than 
CUR.
OBJECTIVES: We determined LPs-CUR's ability to alleviate stress, reduce β-cell 
damage and unraveled the mechanism underlying its protective effect using a 
streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type I diabetic rat model.
METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped into vehicle control, STZ-diabetic 
(STZ 65 mg/kg), STZ-diabetic-3-MA (3-methyladenine [3-MA] 10 mg/kg b.wt), STZ. 
diabetic-LPs-CUR (LPs-CUR 10 mg/kg b.wt), and STZ diabetic-LPs-CUR-3-MA (LPs-CUR 
10 mg/kg b.wt; 3-MA 10 mg/kg b.wt).
RESULTS: LPs-CUR significantly reduced blood glucose, oxidative stress, and 
cellular inflammation in the pancreatic tissue (p &lt; 0.001). ER 
stress-dependent genes included ATF-6, eIF-2, CHOP, JNK, BiP, and XBP LPs-CUR 
significantly suppressed fold changes, while it upregulated the autophagic 
markers Beclin-1 and LC3-II.
CONCLUSIONS: LP-CUR ameliorates β-cell damage by targeting the autophagy pathway 
with the regulatory miRNAs miR-137 and miR-29b, which functionally abrogates ER 
stress in β-cells. This study presents a new therapeutic target for managing 
type I diabetes using miR-137 and miR-29b."
1908,"This 56-day study aimed to evaluate the effects of histidine levels on 
intestinal antioxidant capacity and endoplasmic-reticulum stress (ERS) in 
largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). The initial weights of the largemouth 
bass were (12.33 ± 0.01) g. They were fed six graded levels of histidine: 0.71% 
(deficient group), 0.89%, 1.08%, 1.26%, 1.48%, and 1.67%. The results showed 
that histidine deficiency significantly suppressed the intestinal antioxidant 
enzyme activities, including SOD, CAT, GPx, and intestinal level of GSH, which 
was supported by significantly higher levels of intestinal MDA. Moreover, 
histidine deficiency significantly lowered the mRNA level of nrf2 and 
upregulated the mRNA level of keap1, which further lowered the mRNA levels of 
the downstream genes sod, cat, and gpx. Additionally, 
histidine-deficiency-induced intestinal ERS, which was characterized by 
activating the PEPK-signalling pathway and IRE1-signalling pathway, including 
increased core gene expression of pepk, grp78, eif2α, atf4, chopα, ire1, xbp1, 
traf2, ask1, and jnk1. Dietary histidine deficiency also induced apoptosis and 
necroptosis in the intestine by upregulating the expressions of proapoptotic 
genes, including caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, and bax, and 
necroptosis-related genes, including mlkl and ripk3, while also lowering the 
mRNA level of the antiapoptotic gene bcl-2. Furthermore, histidine deficiency 
activated the NF-κB-signalling pathway to induce an inflammatory response, 
improving the mRNA levels of the proinflammatory factors tnf-α, hepcidin 1, 
cox2, cd80, and cd83 and lowering the mRNA levels of the anti-inflammatory 
factors tgf-β1 and ikbα. Similarly, dietary histidine deficiency significantly 
lowered the intestinal levels of the anti-inflammatory factors TGF-β and IL-10 
and upregulated the intestinal levels of the proinflammatory factor TNF-α, 
showing a trend similar to the gene expression of inflammatory factors. However, 
dietary histidine deficiency inhibited only the level of C3, and no significant 
effects were observed for IgM, IgG, HSP70, or IFN-γ. Based on the MDA and T-SOD 
results, the appropriate dietary histidine requirements of juvenile largemouth 
bass were 1.32% of the diet (2.81% dietary protein) and 1.47% of the diet (3.13% 
dietary protein), respectively, as determined by quadratic regression analysis."
1909,"Plants are an entity essential to the function of the biosphere as well as human 
health. In the context of human health, this research investigated the effect of 
Lasia spinosa (Lour) leaf methanolic extracts (LSML) on antioxidative enzymes 
and gene expression as well as biochemical and histological markers in a 
streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model. Fructose-fed streptozotocin 
(STZ)-induced diabetic animals were subjected to a four-week intervention 
followed by the assessment of the animal's blood and tissues for enzymatic, 
biochemical, histological, and genetic changes. LSML-treated groups were shown 
to decrease plasma glucose levels and improve body and organ weights compared to 
the untreated group in a dose-dependent manner. At the doses of 125 and 250 
mg/kg b.w., LSML were able to normalize serum, hepatic, and renal biochemical 
parameters and restore the pancreas, kidney, liver, and spleen tissue 
architectures to their native state. A considerable increase (p &lt; 0.01) of 
liver antioxidant enzymes CAT, SOD, GSH, and a decrease of MDA level in 
LSML-treated groups were found at higher doses. The improved mRNA expression 
level of antioxidant genes CAT, SOD2, PON1, and PFK1 was also found at the doses 
of 125 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg BW when compared to untreated control groups. The 
results demonstrate that LSML impacts the upregulation of antioxidative gene 
expressions, thus improving the diabetic complications in animal models which 
need to be affirmed by compound-based antioxidative actions for therapeutic 
development."
1910,"Oxidative stress and gut dysbiosis have been known to precede Parkinson's 
disease (PD). An antioxidant-rich product, mangosteen pericarp (MP), has the 
ability to counterbalance excessive free radicals and the imbalanced gut 
microbiota composition, suggesting the MP's capacity to delay PD progression. In 
this study, we explored the effects of two doses of MP extract in a unilateral 
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rat model. We revealed that the 8-week 
supplementation of a low dose (LMP) and a high dose of the MP extract (HMP) 
improved motor function, as observed in decreased contralateral rotation, 
improved time spent on rod, and higher dopamine binding transporter (DAT) in the 
substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The MP extract, especially the HMP, also 
increased antioxidant-related gene expressions, restored muscle mitochondrial 
function, and remodeled fecal microbiota composition, which were followed by 
reduced reactive oxygen species levels in brain and inflammation in plasma. 
Importantly, bacterial genera Sutterella, Rothia, and Aggregatibacter, which 
were negatively correlated with antioxidant gene expressions, decreased in the 
HMP group. It is imperative to note that in addition to directly acting as an 
antioxidant to reduce excessive free radicals, MP extract might also increase 
antioxidant state by rebuilding gut microbiota, thereby enhanced 
anti-inflammatory capacity and restored mitochondrial function to attenuate 
motor deficit in 6-OHDA-induced PD-like condition. All in all, MP extract is a 
potential candidate for auxiliary therapy for PD."
1911,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can improve plant cadmium (Cd) tolerance, but 
the tolerance mechanism in wheat is not fully understood. This study aimed to 
examine the physiological properties and transcriptome changes in wheat 
inoculated with or without Glomus mosseae (GM) under Cd stress (0, 5, and 10 
mg·kg-1 CdCl2) to understand its role in wheat Cd tolerance. The results showed 
that the Cd content in shoots decreased while the Cd accumulation in roots 
increased under AMF symbiosis compared to the non-inoculation group and that AMF 
significantly promoted the growth of wheat seedlings and reduced Cd-induced 
oxidative damage. This alleviative effect of AMF on wheat under Cd stress was 
mainly attributed to the fact that AMF accelerated the ascorbate-glutathione 
(AsA-GSH) cycle, promoted the production of GSH and metallothionein (MTs), 
improved the degradation of methylglyoxal (MG), and induced GRSP 
(glomalin-related soil protein) secretion. Furthermore, a comparative analysis 
of the transcriptomes of the symbiotic group and the non-symbiotic group 
revealed multiple differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 'metal ion 
transport', 'glutathione metabolism', 'cysteine and methionine metabolism', and 
'plant hormone signal transduction' terms. The expression changes of these DEGs 
were basically consistent with the changes in physio-biochemical 
characteristics. Overall, AMF alleviated Cd stress in wheat mainly by promoting 
immobilization and sequestration of Cd, reducing ROS production and accelerating 
their scavenging, in which the rapid metabolism of GSH may play an important 
role."
1912,"Chemotherapy-provoked peripheral neuropathy and its linked comorbidities 
severely reduce the quality of a patient's life. Its therapy is not completely 
resolved and has become an important clinical challenge. The protective actions 
of molecular hydrogen (H2) in many neurological disorders have been described, 
but its effects on memory and the emotional deficits accompanying neuropathic 
pain induced by chemotherapy remain unknown. In this study, using male mice 
injected with paclitaxel (PTX), we examined the effects of systemic treatment 
with hydrogen-rich water (HRW) in: (i) the mechanical and thermal allodynia 
provoked by PTX and the pathways involved; (ii) the memory deficits, anxiety- 
and depressive-like behaviors associated with PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy 
(PIPN); and (iii) the plasticity (p-extracellular signal-regulated protein 
kinase; p-ERK ½), nociceptive (p-protein kinase B, p-Akt), inflammatory 
(p-nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, 
alpha; p-IKBα), and oxidative (4-hydroxynonenal: 4-HNE) alterations provoked by 
PIPN in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The results revealed: (1) the antiallodynic 
actions of HRW administered at one or two times per day during 7 and 3 
consecutive days; (2) the participation of Kv7 potassium channels and the 
Nrf2-heme oxygenase 1-NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 pathway in the 
painkiller effects of HRW; (3) the inhibition of memory deficits and the 
anxiodepressive-like behaviors related with PIPN induced by HRW; and (4) the 
normalization of p-ERK ½, p-Akt and 4-HNE up-regulation and the activation of 
antioxidant enzymes produced by this treatment in PFC. This study proposes HRW 
as a possible effective and safe therapy for PIPN and its associated cognitive 
and emotional deficits."
1913,"Dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms promote transcriptomic and phenotypic 
alterations in cardiovascular diseases. The role of histone methylation-related 
pathways in atherosclerosis is largely unknown. We hypothesize that 
lysine-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1/KDM1A) regulates key molecular effectors 
and pathways linked to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Human 
non-atherosclerotic and atherosclerotic tissue specimens, ApoE-/- mice, and in 
vitro polarized macrophages (Mac) were examined. Male ApoE-/- mice fed a 
normal/atherogenic diet were randomized to receive GSK2879552, a highly specific 
LSD1 inhibitor, or its vehicle, for 4 weeks. The mRNA and protein expression 
levels of LSD1/KDM1A were significantly elevated in atherosclerotic human 
carotid arteries, atherosclerotic aortas of ApoE-/- mice, and M1-Mac. Treatment 
of ApoE-/- mice with GSK2879552 significantly reduced the extent of 
atherosclerotic lesions and the aortic expression of NADPH oxidase subunits 
(Nox1/2/4, p22phox) and 4-hydroxynonenal-protein adducts. Concomitantly, the 
markers of immune cell infiltration and vascular inflammation were significantly 
decreased. LSD1 blockade down-regulated the expression of genes associated with 
Mac pro-inflammatory phenotype. Nox subunit transcript levels were significantly 
elevated in HEK293 reporter cells overexpressing LSD1. In experimental 
atherosclerosis, LSD1 mediates the up-regulation of molecular effectors 
connected to oxidative stress and inflammation. Together, these data indicate 
that LSD1-pharmacological interventions are novel targets for supportive 
therapeutic strategies in atherosclerosis."
1914,"Reduced angiotensin 1-7 bioavailability due to inhibition of 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may contribute to increased mortality in 
hypertensive individuals during COVID-19. However, effects of ACE2 inhibitor 
MLN-4760 in brain functions remain unknown. We investigated the selected 
behavioural and hemodynamic parameters in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) 
after a 2-week s.c. infusion of MLN-4760 (dose 1 mg/kg/day). The biochemical and 
molecular effects of MLN-4760 were investigated in the brainstem and blood 
plasma. MLN-4760 had no effects on hemodynamic and behavioural parameters. 
However, MLN-4760 increased plasma hydrogen sulfide (H2S) level and total nitric 
oxide (NO) synthase activity and conjugated dienes in the brainstem. Increased 
NO synthase activity correlated positively with gene expression of Nos3 while 
plasma H2S levels correlated positively with gene expressions of H2S-producing 
enzymes Mpst, Cth and Cbs. MLN-4760 administration increased gene expression of 
Ace2, Sod1, Sod2, Gpx4 and Hmox1, which positively correlated with expression of 
Nfe2l2 gene encoding the redox-sensitive transcription factor NRF2. 
Collectively, MLN-4760 did not exacerbate pre-existing hypertension and 
behavioural hyperactivity/anxiety in SHRs. However, MLN-4760-induced oxidative 
damage in brainstem was associated with activation of NO- and H2S-mediated 
compensatory mechanisms and with increased gene expression of antioxidant, NO- 
and H2S-producing enzymes that all correlated positively with elevated Nfe2l2 
expression."
1915,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common respiratory 
complication of prematurity as younger and smaller infants are surviving beyond 
the immediate neonatal period. The recognition that oxidative stress (OS) plays 
a key role in BPD pathogenesis has been widely accepted since at least the 
1980s. In this article, we examine the interplay between OS and genetic 
regulation and review 'omics' data related to OS in BPD. Data from animal models 
(largely models of hyperoxic lung injury) and from human studies are presented. 
Epigenetic and transcriptomic analyses have demonstrated several genes related 
to OS to be differentially expressed in murine models that mimic BPD as well as 
in premature infants at risk of BPD development and infants with established 
lung disease. Alterations in the genetic regulation of antioxidant enzymes is a 
common theme in these studies. Data from metabolomics and proteomics have also 
demonstrated the potential involvement of OS-related pathways in BPD. A 
limitation of many studies includes the difficulty of obtaining timely and 
appropriate samples from human patients. Additional 'omics' studies could 
further our understanding of the role of OS in BPD pathogenesis, which may prove 
beneficial for prevention and timely diagnosis, and aid in the development of 
targeted therapies."
1916,"Gentirigeoside B (GTS B) is a dammaren-type triterpenoid glycoside isolated from 
G. rigescens Franch, a traditional Chinese medicinal plant. In the present 
study, the evaluation of the anti-aging effect and action mechanism analysis for 
this compound were conducted. GTS B significantly extended the replicative 
lifespan and chronological lifespan of yeast at doses of 1, 3 and 10 μM. 
Furthermore, the inhibition of Sch9 and activity increase of Rim15, Msn2 
proteins which located downstream of TORC1 signaling pathway were observed after 
treatment with GTS B. Additionally, autophagy of yeast was increased. In 
addition, GTS B significantly improved survival rate of yeast under oxidative 
stress conditions as well as reduced the levels of ROS and MDA. It also 
increased the gene expression and enzymatic activities of key anti-oxidative 
enzymes such as Sod1, Sod2, Cat and Gpx. However, this molecule failed to extend 
the lifespan of yeast mutants such as ∆cat, ∆gpx, ∆sod1, ∆sod2, ∆skn7 and ∆uth1. 
These results suggested that GTS B exerts an anti-aging effect via inhibition of 
the TORC1/Sch9/Rim15/Msn signaling pathway and enhancement of autophagy. 
Therefore, GTS B may be a promising candidate molecule to develop leading 
compounds for the treatment of aging and age-related disorders."
1917,"Berberine (BBR) ameliorates cellular oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy 
induced by lipid metabolism disorder, however, the molecular mechanism 
associated with it is not well known. To study the mechanism, we started with 
m6A methylation modification to investigate its role in lipid deposition 
zebrafish hepatocytes (ZFL). The results showed that BBR could change the 
cellular m6A RNA methylation level, increase m6A levels of Camk1db gene 
transcript and alter Camk1db gene mRNA expression. Via knockdown of the Camk1db 
gene, Camk1db could promote cellular ERK phosphorylation levels. Berberine 
regulated the expression level of Camk1db mRNA by altering the M6A RNA 
methylation of the Camk1db gene, which further affected the synthesis of 
calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and activated ERK signaling pathway 
resulting in changes in downstream physiological indicators including ROS 
production, cell proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy. In conclusion, 
berberine could regulate cellular oxidative stress, apoptosis and autophagy by 
mediating Camk1db m6A methylation through the targeting of the Camk1db/ERK

1918,"There is a serious problem with soil salinization that affects the growth and 
development of plants. Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb (T. ramosissima), as a 
halophyte, is widely used for afforestation in salinized soils. At present, 
there are few reports on the antioxidant mechanism of T. ramosissima under NaCl 
stress. In this study, we learned about the superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) activities, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 
and malondialdehyde (MDA) content changes in T. ramosissima. We also mined the 
relevant metabolic pathways in the antioxidant mechanism, candidate key genes, 
and their related differential metabolites and verified them using quantitative 
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results show that the SOD, POD, and CAT activities, 
and the H2O2 and MDA content reached the highest values in the roots of T. 
ramosissima. Simultaneously, 92 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to 
antioxidant enzyme activities changed during 48 and 168 h of NaCl stress, and 
these DEGs were mainly upregulated in 168 h. Based on the association analysis 
of transcriptomic and metabolomic data, we found Unigene0089358 and 
Unigene0007782 as genes related to key enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthesis 
pathway. They were located in the upstream positive regulation at 48 and 168 h 
under NaCl stress, and their respective related metabolites (phloretin and 
pinocembrin) were involved in resistance to NaCl stress, and they were 
significantly correlated with their respective metabolites. In conclusion, at 48 
and 168 h under NaCl stress, the roots of T. ramosissima resist NaCl stress by 
enhancing enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant mechanisms, scavenging ROS 
generated by high-salt stress, alleviating NaCl toxicity, and maintaining the 
growth of T. ramosissima. This study provides genetic resources and a scientific 
theoretical basis for further breeding of salt-tolerant Tamarix plants and the 
molecular mechanism of antioxidants to alleviate NaCl toxicity."
1919,"Compositions and activities of bacterial flora in the gastrointestinal tract 
significantly influence the metabolism, health, and disease of host humans and 
animals. These enteric bacteria can switch between aerobic and anaerobic growth 
if oxygen tension becomes limited. Interestingly, the switching mechanism is 
important for preventing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antibiotic 
tolerance. Studies have also shown that intracellular and extracellular sulfide 
molecules are involved in this switching control, although the mechanism is not 
fully clarified. Here, we found that YgaV, a sulfide-responsive transcription 
factor SqrR/BigR homolog, responded to sulfide compounds in vivo and in vitro to 
control anaerobic respiratory gene expression. YgaV also responded to H2O2 
scavenging in the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli. Although the wild-type 
(WT) showed increased antibiotic tolerance under H2S-atmospheric conditions, the 
ygaV mutant did not show such a phenotype. Additionally, antibiotic sensitivity 
was higher in the mutant than in the WT of both types in the presence and 
absence of exogenous H2S. These results, therefore, indicated that 
YgaV-dependent transcriptional regulation was responsible for maintaining redox 
homeostasis, ROS scavenging, and antibiotic tolerance."
1920,"Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is a mycotoxin that poses a great threat to agricultural 
production and the health of humans and animals. Pterostilbene (PTE) is a 
natural plant polyphenolic compound with good anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and 
cell regeneration effects, yet its effectiveness in treating FB1-induced 
cytotoxicity remains to be explored. In this study, we used porcine alveolar 
macrophages (3D4/21) as a model to characterize the cytotoxicity induced by FB1, 
and to investigate the potential alleviating effect of PTE on FB1-induced 
cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that FB1 induces cytotoxicity, apoptosis, 
pro-inflammatory cytokine production and mitochondrial damage, which can be 
largely recovered by PTE treatment, suggesting the promising application of PTE 
to treat FB1-induced damage. Mechanistically, FB1 activates the JAK/STAT 
signaling pathway, while PTE attenuates FB1-induced cytotoxicity through the 
inhibition of key JAK/STAT genes such as JAK2 and STAT3. Overall, our study 
characterized the molecular mechanism for FB1-induced cytotoxicity and found PTE 
to be a promising component which can alleviate FB1-induced cytotoxicity by 
interfering in the activation of JAK/STAT pathway."
1921,"Dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids found in fish has been reported to reduce 
the risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Stearidonic acid (SDA), a plant-based 
omega-3 fatty acid, has been targeted as a potential surrogate for fish-based 
fatty acids. However, its role in neuronal degeneration is unknown. This study 
was designed to evaluate effects of SDA on Amyloid-β(A-β)-induced neurotoxicity 
in rat hippocampal cells. Results showed that SDA effectively converted to 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in hippocampal cells. Aβ-induced apoptosis in H19-7 
cells was protected by SDA pretreatment as evidenced by its regulation on the 
expression of relevant pro- and anti-apoptotic genes, as well as the inhibition 
on caspase activation. SDA also protected H19-7 cells from Aβ-induced oxidative 
stress by regulating the expression of relevant pro- and anti-oxidative genes, 
as well as the improvement in activity of catalase. As for Aβ/LPS-induced 
neuronal inflammation, SDA pretreatment reduced the release of IL-1β and TNFα. 
Further, we found that the anti-Aβ effect of SDA involves its inhibition on the 
expression of amyloid precursor protein and the regulation on MAPK signaling. 
These results demonstrated that SDAs have neuroprotective effect in Aβ-induced 
H19-7 hippocampal cells. This beneficial effect of SDA was attributed to its 
antiapoptotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties."
1922,"Manganese Superoxide Dismutase (MnSOD) represents a mitochondrial protein that 
scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsible for oxidative stress. A 
known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4880 on the SOD2 gene, causing a 
mutation from alanine to valine (Ala16Val) in the primary structure of immature 
MnSOD, has been associated with several types of cancer and other autoimmune 
diseases. However, no conclusive correlation has been established yet. This 
study aims to determine the effect of the alanine to valine mutation on the 
secondary structure of the MnSOD mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). A model 
for each variant of the MTS was prepared and extensively simulated with 
molecular dynamics simulations using the CHARMM36m force field. The results 
indicate that the alanine variant of the MTS preserves a uniform α-helical 
secondary structure favorable for the protein transport into mitochondria, 
whereas the valine variant quickly breaks down its α-helix. Thus, the alanine 
MTS represents the more active MnSOD variant, the benefits of which have yet to 
be determined experimentally."
1923,"Increased oxidative stress in osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage mediates catabolic 
signal transduction leading to extracellular matrix degradation and chondrocyte 
apoptosis. This study aimed to explore the contribution of NADPH oxidase (NOX), 
a major source of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), to the catabolic 
process of chondrocytes and to OA. The inhibition of NOX isoforms with a pan-NOX 
inhibitor, APX-115, significantly decreased IL-1β-induced ROS production in 
primary chondrocytes and, most potently, suppressed the expression of oxidative 
stress marker genes and catabolic proteases compared with the inhibition of 
other ROS sources. Catabolic stimuli by IL-1β treatment and in post-traumatic OA 
conditions upregulated the expression of NOX2 and NOX4 in chondrocytes. In the 
post-traumatic OA model, the pharmacologic inhibition of NOX protected mice 
against OA by modulating the oxidative stress and the expression of MMP-13 and 
Adamts5 in chondrocytes. Mechanistically, NOX inhibition suppresses Rac1, p38, 
and JNK MAPK signaling consistently and restores oxidative phosphorylation in 
IL-1β-treated chondrocytes. In conclusion, NOX inhibition prevented the 
development of OA by attenuating the catabolic signaling and restoring the 
mitochondrial metabolism and can thus be a promising class of drug for OA."
1924,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is due to the oxidation of alpha synuclein (αSyn) 
contributing to motor impairment. We developed a transgenic mouse model of PD 
that overexpresses the mutated human αSyn gene (A53T) crossed to a mouse 
expressing the human MPO gene. This model exhibits increased oxidation and 
chlorination of αSyn leading to greater motor impairment. In the current study, 
the hMPO-A53T mice were treated with thiocyanate (SCN-) which is a favored 
substrate of MPO as compared to chlorine. We show that hMPO-A53T mice treated 
with SCN- have less chlorination in the brain and show an improvement in motor 
skills compared to the nontreated hMPO-A53T mice. Interestingly, in the 
hMPO-A53T mice we found a possible link between MPO-related disease and the 
glymphatic system which clears waste including αSyn from the brain. The 
untreated hMPO-A53T mice exhibited an increase in the size of periventricular 
glymphatic vessels expressing the glymphatic marker LYVE1 and aquaporin 4 
(AQP4). These vessels also exhibited an increase in MPO and HOCl-modified 
epitopes in the glymphatic vessels correlating with loss of ependymal cells 
lining the ventricles. These findings suggest that MPO may significantly promote 
the impairment of the glymphatic waste removal system thus contributing to 
neurodegeneration in PD. Moreover, the inhibition of MPO chlorination/oxidation 
by SCN- may provide a potential therapeutic approach to this disease."
1925,"Oxidative stress is an important factor on both aging and disease. Among foods 
endowed with beneficial healthy properties, rice is a very useful material, not 
only because it has a good amino acid ratio and produces antioxidant peptides 
through microbial fermentation, but also for its inexpensive availability. In 
this study, rice was treated with Lactobacillus plantarum, and the resulting 
mixture of small peptides with less than 11 amino acids (RFP) was extracted and 
purified from the fermentation broth. Subsequently, the antioxidant activity of 
RFP was assessed using the chemical model, cell biology, and animal model 
methods. RFP enhanced the expression of the antioxidant enzyme genes downstream 
of the KEAP1-NRF2/ARE pathway by promoting nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related 
factor 2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation while simultaneously removing lipid 
oxidation products and excess free radicals. These results suggest that RFP is a 
potential substance for resisting aging and disease caused by oxidative stress."
1926,"Lettuce is sensitive to high temperature, and exogenous spermidine can improve 
heat tolerance in lettuce, but its intrinsic mechanism is still unclear. We 
analyzed the effects of exogenous spermidine on the leaf physiological 
metabolism, transcriptome and metabolome of lettuce seedlings under 
high-temperature stress using the heat-sensitive lettuce variety 'Beisansheng 
No. 3' as the material. The results showed that exogenous spermidine increased 
the total fresh weight, total dry weight, root length, chlorophyll content and 
total flavonoid content, increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as 
superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT), and decreased 
malondialdehyde (MDA) content in lettuce under high temperature stress. 
Transcriptome and metabolome analyses revealed 818 differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) and 393 metabolites between water spray and spermidine spray 
treatments under high temperature stress, and 75 genes from 13 transcription 
factors (TF) families were included in the DEGs. The Kyoto encyclopedia of genes 
and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of DEG contains pathways for 
plant-pathogen interactions, photosynthesis-antennal proteins, mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and flavonoid biosynthesis. A total of 
19 genes related to flavonoid synthesis were detected. Most of these 19 DEGs 
were down-regulated under high temperature stress and up-regulated after 
spermidine application, which may be responsible for the increase in total 
flavonoid content. We provide a possible source and conjecture for exploring the 
mechanism of exogenous spermidine-mediated heat tolerance in lettuce."
1927,"In the present study, we evaluated the acute response of mice exposed to IQOS 
aerosol, a brand-name heated tobacco product (HTP), in the lung tissue. First, 
the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) value was measured as an 
index to assess oxidative stress, and a significant increase was observed after 
exposure, followed by a significant increase in the total lung GSH 
concentration. The stress responses induced by IQOS aerosols was then analyzed 
by focusing on the changes in Nrf2 and ATF4, which are transcription factors 
that induce the expression of genes involved in GSH biosynthesis or metabolism. 
Although Nrf2 activation was not observed, significant accumulation of ATF4 in 
the nuclear fraction was noted three hours after exposure to IQOS aerosols. Upon 
an examination of changes in factors in the GSH biosynthetic system, a 
significant increase in cystine concentration in the lung tissue was measured, 
and an increase in xCT expression level was observed in the cell membrane 
fraction three-six hours after IQOS exposure. Furthermore, characteristic 
changes in HO-1, a stress-response protein regulated by ATF4, was discovered six 
hours after IQOS exposure. Moreover, analysis of the upstream ATF4 regulatory 
system revealed that phosphorylation of eIF2α was enhanced in the lung 
cytoplasmic fraction three hours after exposure to IQOS aerosols. These findings 
suggest that ER stress might be induced as an early response to IQOS aerosol 
exposure, accompanied by the activation of the eIF2α-ATF4 axis. These 
intracellular changes have also been reported after exposure to combustible 
cigarette smoke. Thus, the acute response found in the lungs of mice in the 
present study demonstrate that the inhalation of aerosols from IQOS elicits a 
biological response similar to that of combustible cigarette smoke. In 
conclusion, our results provide evidence that the biological effects of HTPs, 
such as IQOS, cannot be ignored in the lungs."
1928,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are normal products of a number of biochemical 
reactions and are important signaling molecules. However, at the same time, they 
are toxic to cells and have to be strictly regulated by their antioxidant 
systems. The etiology and pathogenesis of many diseases are associated with 
increased ROS levels, and many external stress factors directly or indirectly 
cause oxidative stress in cells. Within this context, the overexpression of 
genes encoding the proteins in antioxidant systems seems to have become a viable 
approach to decrease the oxidative stress caused by pathological conditions and 
to increase cellular stress resistance. However, such manipulations unavoidably 
lead to side effects, the most dangerous of which is an increased probability of 
healthy tissue malignization or increased tumor aggression. The aims of the 
present review were to collect and systematize the results of studies devoted to 
the effects resulting from the overexpression of antioxidant system genes on 
stress resistance and carcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In most cases, the 
overexpression of these genes was shown to increase cell and organism 
resistances to factors that induce oxidative and genotoxic stress but to also 
have different effects on cancer initiation and promotion. The last fact greatly 
limits perspectives of such manipulations in practice. The overexpression of 
GPX3 and SOD3 encoding secreted proteins seems to be the ""safest"" among the 
genes that can increase cell resistance to oxidative stress. High efficiency and 
safety potential can also be found for SOD2 overexpression in combinations with 
GPX1 or CAT and for similar combinations that lead to no significant changes in 
H2O2 levels. Accumulation, systematization, and the integral analysis of data on 
antioxidant gene overexpression effects can help to develop approaches for 
practical uses in biomedical and agricultural areas. Additionally, a number of 
factors such as genetic and functional context, cell and tissue type, 
differences in the function of transcripts of one and the same gene, regulatory 
interactions, and additional functions should be taken into account."
1929,"The flowering of chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.), inhibited by 
long-day lighting, can be reversed with a short period of low supplemental blue 
light (S-BL). Both flowering and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging 
processes are primarily driven by sugars created by photosynthetic carbon 
assimilation. In addition, the antioxidant ability potentially affects flowering 
in photoperiod- and/or circadian rhythm-dependent manners. This indicates that 
there is an interactive relationship among blue (B) light, photosynthetic 
efficiency, sugar accumulation, and antioxidant ability in flowering regulation. 
Here, 4 h of 30 μmol·m-2·s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) S-BL was 
applied at the end of a 13-h long-day period (LD13 + 4B) at different intervals 
during 60 days of experimental duration. The five experimental groups were named 
according to the actual number of days of S-BL and their intervals: applied once 
every day, ""60 days-(LD13 + 4B) (100.0%)""; once every other day, ""30 days-(LD13 
+ 4B) (50.0%)""; once every three days, ""15 days-(LD13 + 4B) (25.0%)""; once every 
five days, ""10 days-(LD13 + 4B) (16.7%)""; and once every seven days, ""7 
days-(LD13 + 4B) (11.7%)"". Two non-S-BL control groups were also included: 60 
10-h short days (60 days-SD10) and 13-h long days (60 days-LD13). At the harvest 
stage, varying degrees of flowering were observed except in ""60 days-LD13"" and 
""7 days-(LD13 + 4B) (11.7%)"". The number of flowers increased and the flower 
buds appeared earlier as the proportion of S-BL days increased in LD13 
conditions, although the ""60 days-SD10"" gave the earliest flowering. The 
proportion of initial, pivotal, and optimal flowering was 16.7% (""10 days-(LD13 
+ 4B)""), 50.0% (""30 days-(LD13 + 4B)""), and 100.0% (""60 days-(LD13 + 4B)""), 
respectively. Meanwhile, a series of physiological parameters such as the 
production of enzymatic or non-enzymatic antioxidants, chlorophyll content, 
photosynthetic efficiency, enzyme activities, and carbohydrate accumulation were 
significantly improved by ""30 days-(LD13 + 4B) (50.0%)"" as a turning point until 
the peaks appeared in ""60 days-(LD13 + 4B) (100.0%)"", as well as the expression 
of florigenic or anti-florigenic and some antioxidant-synthetic genes. 
Furthermore, the results of principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that 
S-BL days positively regulated flowering, photosynthesis, carbohydrate 
accumulation, and antioxidant production. In aggregate, the pivotal and optimal 
proportions of S-BL days to reconcile the relationship among flowering, 
photosynthetic carbon assimilation, and antioxidant ability were 50.0% and 
100.0%, respectively. However, there are still significant gaps to be filled in 
order to determine the specific involvement of blue light and antioxidant 
abilities in flowering regulation."
1930,"Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is a vital lipid that functions as an electron carrier in the 
mitochondrial electron transport chain and as a membrane-soluble antioxidant. 
Deficiencies in CoQ lead to metabolic diseases with a wide range of clinical 
manifestations. There are currently few treatments that can slow or stop disease 
progression. Primary CoQ10 deficiency can arise from mutations in any of the COQ 
genes responsible for CoQ biosynthesis. While many mutations in these genes have 
been identified, the clinical significance of most of them remains unclear. Here 
we analyzed the structural and functional impact of 429 human missense single 
nucleotide variants (SNVs) that give rise to amino acid substitutions in the 
conserved and functional regions of human genes encoding a high molecular weight 
complex known as the CoQ synthome (or Complex Q), consisting of the COQ3-COQ7 
and COQ9 gene products. Using structures of COQ polypeptides, close homologs, 
and AlphaFold models, we identified 115 SNVs that are potentially pathogenic. 
Further biochemical characterizations in model organisms such as Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae are required to validate the pathogenicity of the identified SNVs. 
Collectively, our results will provide a resource for clinicians during patient 
diagnosis and guide therapeutic efforts toward combating primary CoQ10 
deficiency."
1931,"The transient receptor potential plays a critical role in the sensory nervous 
systems of vertebrates in response to various mechanisms and stimuli, such as 
environmental temperature. We studied the physiological adaptive evolution of 
the TRP gene in the saurian family and performed a comprehensive analysis to 
identify the evolution of the thermo-TRPs channels. All 251 putative TRPs were 
divided into 6 subfamilies, except TRPN, from the 8 saurian genomes. Multiple 
characteristics of these genes were analyzed. The results showed that the most 
conserved proteins of TRP box 1 were located in motif 1, and those of TRP box 2 
were located in motif 10. The TRPA and TRPV in saurian tend to be one cluster, 
as a sister cluster with TRPC, and the TRPM is the root of group I. The TRPM, 
TRPV, and TRPP were clustered into two clades, and TRPP were organized into 
TRP&amp;nbsp;PKD1-like and PKD2-like. Segmental duplications mainly occurred in 
the TRPM subfamily, and tandem duplications only occurred in the TRPV subfamily. 
There were 15 sites to be under positive selection for TRPA1 and TRPV2 genes. In 
summary, gene structure, chromosomal location, gene duplication, synteny 
analysis, and selective pressure at the molecular level provided some new 
evidence for genetic adaptation to the environment. This result provides a basis 
for identifying and classifying TRP genes and contributes to further elucidating 
their potential function in thermal sensors."
1932,"The RNA-Seq data provides new opportunities for the detection of transcriptome 
variants' single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in various species and tissues. 
Herein, milk samples from two sheep breeds and two cow breeds were utilized to 
characterize the genetic variation in the coding regions in three stages 
(before-peak (BP), peak (P), and after-peak (AP)) of the lactation process. In 
sheep breeds Assaf and Churra, 100,462 and 97,768, 65,996 and 62,161, and 78,656 
and 39,245 variants were observed for BP, P, and AP lactation stages, 
respectively. The number of specific variants was 59,798 and 76,419, 11,483 and 
49,210, and 104,033 and 320,817 in cow breeds Jersy and Kashmiri, respectively, 
for BP, P, and AP stages. Via the transcriptome analysis of variation in regions 
containing QTL for fat, protein percentages, and milk yield, we detected a 
number of pathways and genes harboring mutations that could influence milk 
production attributes. Many SNPs detected here can be regarded as appropriate 
markers for custom SNP arrays or genotyping platforms to conduct association 
analyses among commercial populations. The results of this study offer new 
insights into milk production genetic mechanisms in cow and sheep breeds, which 
can contribute to designing suitable breeding systems for optimal milk 
production."
1933,"The Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis, Kaup 1858), a marine flatfish, belongs 
to the Pleuronectiformes order. It is a commercially important species for 
fisheries and aquaculture. However, in aquaculture, several production 
bottlenecks have still to be resolved, including skeletal deformities and high 
mortality during the larval and juvenile phase. The study aims to characterize 
the hox gene clusters in S. senegalensis to understand better the developmental 
and metamorphosis process in this species. Using a BAC library, the clones that 
contain hox genes were isolated, sequenced by NGS and used as BAC-FISH probes. 
Subsequently the hox clusters were studied by sequence analysis, comparative 
genomics, and cytogenetic and phylogenetic analysis. Cytogenetic analysis 
demonstrated the localization of four BAC clones on chromosome pairs 4, 12, 13, 
and 16 of the Senegalese sole cytogenomic map. Comparative and phylogenetic 
analysis showed a highly conserved organization in each cluster and different 
phylogenetic clustering in each hox cluster. Analysis of structural and 
repetitive sequences revealed accumulations of polymorphisms mediated by 
repetitive elements in the hoxba cluster, mainly retroelements. Therefore, a 
possible loss of the hoxb7a gene can be established in the Pleuronectiformes 
lineage. This work allows the organization and regulation of hox clusters to be 
understood, and is a good base for further studies of expression patterns."
1934,"Tattoo skin disease (TSD) is a poxviral dermatopathy diagnosed in cetaceans. We 
review the literature on TSD aetiology, clinical characteristics, pathology and 
epidemiology and evaluate immune responses against the virus. In addition, 
necropsy reports for fifty-five harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), 
twenty-two Delphinidae and four Kogiidae stranded in northern California in 
2018-2021 were checked for diagnostic tattoo lesions. TSD occurs in the 
Mediterranean, North and Barents Seas, as well as in the Atlantic, eastern 
Pacific and Indian Oceans in at least 21 cetacean species, with varying 
prevalence. Two cetacean poxvirus (CePV) clades are recognised: CePV-1 in 
odontocetes and CePV-2 in mysticetes. CePV-1 isolates were recovered from six 
Delphinidae and one Phocoenidae in the Americas, Europe and Hong Kong. Strains 
from Delphinidae are closely related. Among Phocoenidae, poxviruses were sampled 
only in harbour porpoises around the British Isles. CePV-2 isolates were 
obtained from southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) and a bowhead whale 
(Balaena mysticetus). In healthy animals, an immune response develops over time, 
with young calves protected by maternal immunity. Salinity and sea surface 
temperature do not seem to influence TSD prevalence in free-ranging cetaceans. 
High concentrations of immunotoxic halogenated organochlorines may cause a more 
severe clinical disease. Substitution and loss of genes involved in anti-viral 
immunity may favour CePV entry, replication and persistence in the epidermis. 
Off California, Delphinidae were less often (26.3%) affected by TSD than harbour 
porpoises (43.6%). Male porpoises were significantly more prone (58.1%) to show 
clinical disease than females (25%). Among males, TSD affected a high proportion 
of juveniles and subadults. TSD was not detected in the Kogiidae."
1935,"This study assessed the effect of rice protein meal replacement for fish meal on 
the growth, nonspecific immunity, and disease resistance on juvenile shrimp 
Litopenaeus vannamei. Six groups of iso-nitrogenous and iso-lipid feeds named 
FM, R10, R20, R40, R60, and R80 were prepared by replacing 0%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 
60%, and 80% in FM protein with RPM, respectively, and then fed to the shrimps 
(0.54 ± 0.01 g). An amount of 720 healthy and evenly sized shrimps were 
allocated to six groups (three replicates per group) and fed four times a day 
(7:00, 11:00, 17:00 and 21:00) for eight weeks. Results revealed no significant 
differences in WG, FCR, and SGR of shrimps after replacing FM with 10% RPM (p 
&gt; 0.05). In the R10 and R20 groups, SOD and T-AOC activities were 
significantly higher than those in the FM group, whereas the opposite was 
observed for MDA content (p &lt; 0.05). CAT, ACP, and LZM were all significantly 
higher in the R10, R20, and R40 groups than in the FM group (p &lt; 0.05). 
GSH-Px activity in the R10 group was significantly higher than the activity in 
the FM group (p &lt; 0.05). AKP, PO, TYS, GPT, and GOT activities were 
significantly higher in the R10 group than in the FM group (p &lt; 0.05). 
Compared to the FM group, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3K 
(eif3k) gene was significantly up-regulated in the R10 group, whereas the 
penaiedin 3a (pen 3a) and anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (alf) genes were 
significantly up-regulated in the R10 and R20 groups (p &lt; 0.05). The crustin 
a (cru a), immune deficiency (imd), and lysozyme (lzm) mRNA levels were 
significantly higher in the R10, R20, and R40 groups than in the other groups (p 
&lt; 0.05). The prophenoloxidase (PO) mRNA levels in the R20 group were 
significantly higher than those in the FM group (p &lt; 0.05). The replacement 
of 10-40% of FM with RPM improved the gut flora composition of shrimps, 
increasing beneficial bacteria (Bacteroidetes) abundance and reducing harmful 
bacteria (Aspergillus and Vibrio) abundance. After the challenge test of Vibrio 
parahaemolyticus (7 days), the cumulative mortality in the R10 group 
significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, replacement of 10% FM by 
RPM significantly improved digestibility, protein synthesis, antioxidant 
capacity, and disease resistance in L. vannamei."
1936,"The continuous ovulation of laying hens during the peak period is likely to 
cause oxidative stress, resulting in a reduction in the laying cycle over time. 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant effects of Aronia 
melanocarpa (AM) in the diet and its effect on the yolk precursor content caused 
by ovulation in laying hens during the peak period. A total of 300 25-week-old 
Roman brown laying hens were randomly divided into five groups with six 
replicates in each group, 10 in each replicate. The control group was fed a 
basal diet, the positive control group was fed a Vitamin C (VC) plus basal diet, 
and the experimental group was fed 1%, 4%, and 7% doses of AM plus diet 
according to the principle of energy and nitrogen requirements, which lasted 
eight weeks. At the end of the study, the egg quality, biochemical, and 
antioxidant markers, as well as mRNA and protein expressions, were evaluated to 
determine the potential signaling pathways involved. Results showed that the 
addition of AM to the feed increased the weight of laying hens at the peak of 
egg production and improved egg quality. The biochemical markers, as well as the 
antioxidant parameters in the serum, liver, and ovarian tissues, were 
ameliorated. The gene and protein expression of recombinant kelch-like 
ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in the liver and ovarian tissues was decreased, 
while nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 
(HO-1) expression was increased. The feed supplemented with AM also increased 
the estrogen contents and lipid parameters, as well as the gene and protein 
expressions related to the yolk precursor. Feed supplemented with AM could 
improve the egg quality and the oxidative stress caused by the ovulation process 
of laying hens during the peak egg production period by activating the 
Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. These results suggest that the feed supplemented 
with 1% AM and 4% AM can improve egg production in peak laying hens."
1937,"The species living in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau provide an excellent model 
system for studying the relationship between molecular convergent evolution and 
adaptation. Distant species experiencing the same selection pressure (i.e., 
hypoxia, low temperature and strong ultraviolet radiation) are likely to evolve 
similar genetic adaptations independently. Here, we performed comparative 
genomics studies on six independently evolved high-altitude species. The results 
also showed that the convergent evolution of the six species was mainly 
reflected at the level of rapidly evolving genes, and the functions of these 
rapidly evolving genes were mainly related to hypoxia response and DNA damage 
repair. In addition, we found that high-altitude species had more gene family 
changes than their low-altitude relatives, except for the order Lagomorpha. The 
results also show that the convergence of the gene family contraction of 
high-altitude species is much greater than that of expansion, revealing a 
possible pattern of species in adapting to high-altitude. Furthermore, we 
detected a positive selection signature in four genes related to hypoxia 
response and ultraviolet radiation damage in these six species (FYCO1, ERBIN, 
SCAMP1 and CXCL10). Our study reveals that hypoxia response might play an 
important role in the adaptation of independently evolved species to a 
high-altitude environment, providing a basic perspective for further exploring 
the high-altitude adaptation mechanism of different related species in the 
future."
1938,"The photoperiod regulates the seasonal reproduction of mammals by affecting the 
follicle development, for which the granulosa cells provide nutrition. However, 
the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus 
sungorus) were raised under different photoperiods to study the ovarian status 
and explore the potential mechanism of the follicle development mediated by the 
FSH-Nodal/ALK7 signaling pathway. Compared with the moderate daylight (MD) 
group, the short daylight (SD) group exhibited a significant decrease in the 
ovarian weight and increase in the atretic follicle number and granulosa cell 
apoptosis, whereas the long daylight (LD) group showed an increase in the 
ovarian weight, the growing follicle number, and the antral follicle number, but 
a decrease in the granulosa cell apoptosis. Based on these findings, the key 
genes of the Nodal/ALK7 signaling pathway controlling the granulosa cell 
apoptosis were studied using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction and western blotting. In the SD group, the follicle-stimulating hormone 
(FSH) concentration significantly decreased and the Nodal/ALK7/Smad signaling 
pathways were activated, while the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3)/Akt 
signaling pathway was inhibited. The BAX expression was significantly increased, 
while the Bcl-xL expression was significantly decreased, leading to an increase 
in the caspase-3 activity, the granulosa cell apoptosis, and ovarian 
degeneration. However, in the LD group, the FSH concentration significantly 
increased, the Nodal/ALK7/Smad signaling pathway was inhibited, and the PIK3/Akt 
signaling pathway was activated. Taken together, our results indicate that the 
photoperiod can regulate the apoptosis of the granulosa cells by regulating the 
concentration of FSH, activating or inhibiting the Nodal/ALK7 signaling pathway, 
thereby affecting the ovarian function. Our research provides an important 
theoretical basis for understanding the photoperiod-regulated mechanisms of the 
mammalian seasonal reproduction."
1939,"Pain, usually caused by a strong or disruptive stimulus, is an unpleasant 
sensation that serves as a warning to organisms. To adapt to extreme 
environments, some terrestrial animals have evolved to be inherently insensitive 
to pain. Cetaceans are known as supposedly indifferent to pain from soft tissue 
injury representatives of marine mammals. However, the molecular mechanisms that 
explain how cetaceans are adapted to pain in response to seawater environment 
remain unclear. Here, we performed a molecular evolutionary analysis of 
pain-related genes in selected representatives of cetaceans. ASIC4 gene was 
identified to be pseudogenized in all odontocetes (toothed whales) except from 
Physeter macrocephalus (sperm whales), and relaxed selection of this gene was 
detected in toothed whales with pseudogenized ASIC4. In addition, positive 
selection was detected in pain perception (i.e., ASIC3, ANO1, CCK, and SCN9A) 
and analgesia (i.e., ASIC3, ANO1, CCK, and SCN9A) genes among the examined 
cetaceans. In this study, potential convergent amino acid substitutions within 
predicted proteins were found among the examined cetaceans and other terrestrial 
mammals, inhabiting extreme environments (e.g., V441I of TRPV1 in cetaceans and 
naked mole rats). Moreover, specific amino acid substitutions within predicted 
sequences of several proteins were found in the studied representatives of 
cetaceans (e.g., F56L and D163A of ASIC3, E88G of GRK2, and F159L of OPRD1). 
Most of the substitutions were located within important functional domains of 
proteins, affecting their protein functions. The above evidence suggests that 
cetaceans might have undergone adaptive molecular evolution in pain-related 
genes through different evolutionary patterns to adapt to pain, resulting in 
greater sensitivity to pain and more effective analgesia. This study could have 
implications for diagnosis and treatment of human pain."
1940,"From 100 to 200 days of gestation, 52 cows carrying male (n = 30) or female (n = 
22) fetuses were assigned to CON (basal diet-5.5% of CP, n = 26) or SUP (basal 
diet + protein supplement [40% CP, 3.5 g/kg BW]-12% of CP, n = 26) treatments. 
Glucose concentrations decreased at 200 (p ≤ 0.01; CON = 46.9 and SUP = 54.7 
mg/dL) and 270 days (p ≤ 0.05; CON = 48.4 and SUP = 53.3 mg/dL) for CON compared 
to SUP. The same pattern occurred for insulin (p ≤ 0.01). At parturition, the 
NEFA concentration was greater (p = 0.01, 0.10 vs. 0.08 mmol/L) for CON than for 
SUP. Total AA increased in SUP (p ≤ 0.03) at mid- and late-gestation compared to 
CON. At 200 days, CON dams carrying females had less essential AA (p = 0.01) 
than cows carrying males. The SUP dams had greater expressions of protein 
synthesis markers, namely eIf4E and GSK3β (p ≤ 0.04), at day 200 and of MuFR1 
(protein degradation marker, p ≤ 0.04) at parturition. Supplemented cows had 
higher hepatic pyruvate carboxylase expressions (p = 0.02). Therefore, PS 
alleviates the restriction overload on maternal metabolism."
1941,"Epigenetic factors, including non-coding RNA regulation, play a vital role in 
the development of obesity and have been well researched. Transfer RNA-derived 
small RNA (tsRNA) is a class of non-coding RNA proven to be involved in various 
aspects of mammalian biology. Here we take pigs as a model for obesity research 
and use tsRNA-seq to investigate the difference in tsRNA expression in the 
subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese and lean pigs to elucidate the role of 
tsRNA in obesity development. A total of 482 tsRNAs were identified in pig 
adipose tissue, of which 123 were significantly differentially accumulated 
tsRNAs compared with the control group. The tRF-5c was the main type of these 
tsRNAs. The largest number of tsRNAs produced was the Gly-carrying tRNA, which 
produced 81 tsRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that differential 
tsRNAs indirectly participated in MAPK, AMPK, insulin resistance, the TNF 
signaling pathway, adipocytokine signaling pathway, and other signaling pathways 
by interacting with target genes. These are involved in bioenergetic metabolic 
regulatory processes, suggesting that tsRNAs may influence these pathways to 
mediate the regulation of energy metabolism in porcine adipocytes to promote 
lipid deposition, thus contributing to obesity. Our findings suggest a potential 
function of tsRNA in regulating obesity development."
1942,"Triclosan is a chlorinated biphenolic with a broad spectrum of antiseptic 
activities used in cosmetics and hygiene products. Continuous exposure can lead 
to absorption and bioaccumulation of this substance with harmful health effects. 
In fact, previous studies have shown that Triclosan acts as an 
endocrine-disrupting chemical on reproductive organs, with consequent negative 
effects on reproductive physiology. Therefore, to assess potential adverse 
impacts on fertility, we tested Triclosan on swine granulosa cells, a model of 
endocrine reproductive cells. We examined its effects on the main features of 
granulosa cell functions such as cell growth (BrdU incorporation and ATP 
production) and steroidogenesis (17-β estradiol and progesterone secretion). 
Moreover, since oxidant-antioxidant balance plays a pivotal role in follicular 
function, redox status markers (superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide 
production, enzymatic and non-enzymatic scavenging activity) were studied. Our 
results show that Triclosan significantly inhibits cell growth (p &lt; 0.001), 
steroidogenesis (p &lt; 0.001), superoxide and nitric oxide production (p &lt; 
0.001), while it increases (p &lt; 0.05) enzymatic defense systems. 
Collectively, these data suggest a disruption of the main granulosa cell 
functions, i.e., proliferation and hormone production, as well as an imbalance 
in redox status. On these bases, we can speculate that Triclosan would impair 
granulosa cell functions, thus exerting negative effects on reproductive 
function. Further studies are needed to explore lower Triclosan concentrations 
and to unravel its mechanisms of action at gene level."
1943,"The purpose of this study was to investigate annual changes in BoRVA strains by 
examining the VP4 and VP7 genes of rotaviruses in Korean calves. Between 2014 
and 2018, 35 out of 138 samples of calf diarrhea feces collected nationwide were 
positive for BoRVA. Further genetic characterization of the VP7 and VP4 genes of 
35 BoRVA isolates identified three different G-genotypes (G6, G8, and G10) and 
two different P genotypes (P[5] and P[11]). The G6 genotype was most common 
(94.3%) in BoRVA-positive calves, followed by the P[5] genotype (82.9%). Four 
genotypes comprised combinations of VP4 and VP7: 80% were G6P[5], 14.2% were 
G6P[11], 2.9% were G8P[5], and 2.9% were G10P[11]. Susceptibility to infection 
was highest in calves aged &lt; 10 days (35%) and lowest in calves aged 30-50 
days (15.4%). The data presented herein suggest that the G6P[5] genotype is the 
main causative agent of diarrhea in Korean calves. In addition, it is predicted 
that G6P[5] will continue to act as a major cause of diarrhea in Korean calves."
1944,"Toxocara vitulorum (Ascaridida: Nematoda) is one of the most common intestinal 
nematodes of cattle and buffalos and, therefore, represents a serious threat to 
their populations worldwide. Despite its significance in veterinary health the 
epidemiology, population genetics, and molecular ecology of this nematode remain 
poorly understood. The mitogenome can yield a foundation for studying these 
areas and assist in the surveillance and control of T. vitulorum. Herein, the 
first whole mitogenome of T. vitulorum was sequenced utilizing Illumina 
technology and characterized with bioinformatic pipeline analyses. The entire 
genome of T. vitulorum was 15,045 bp in length and contained 12 protein-coding 
genes (PCGs), 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). The gene 
arrangement (GA) of T. vitulorum was similar to those of other Toxocara species 
under GA3. The whole genome showed significant levels of AT and GC skew. 
Comparative mitogenomics including sequence identities, Ka/Ks, and sliding 
window analysis, indicated a purifying selection of 12 PCGs with cox1 and nad6 
having the lowest and highest evolutionary rate, respectively. Whole amino acid 
sequence-based phylogenetic analysis supported a novel sister-species 
relationship of T. vitulorum with the congeneric species Toxocara canis, 
Toxocara cati, and Toxocara malaysiensis in the family Toxocaridae. Further, 12 
(PCGs) single gene-based phylogenies suggested that nad4 and nad6 genes shared 
same topological trees with that of the whole genome, suggesting that these 
genes were suitable as novel genetic markers for phylogenetic and evolutionary 
studies of Ascaridida species. This complete mitogenome of T. vitulorum refined 
phylogenetic relationships in Toxocaridae and provided the resource of markers 
for population genetics, systematics, and epidemiology of this bovine nematode."
1945,"The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes a highly 
contagious disease in domestic swine. Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule 
family member 1 (SLAMF1) is a costimulatory factor that is involved in innate 
immunity, inflammation, and infection. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression 
of the SLAMF1 gene inhibited PRRSV replication significantly and reduced the 
levels of key signaling pathways, including MyD88, RIG-I, TLR2, TRIF, and 
inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-β, TNF-α, and IFN-α in vitro. 
However, the knockdown of the SLAMF1 gene could enhance replication of the PRRSV 
and the levels of key signaling pathways and inflammatory factors. Overall, our 
results identify a new, to our knowledge, antagonist of the PRRSV, as well as a 
novel antagonistic mechanism evolved by inhibiting innate immunity and 
inflammation, providing a new reference and direction for PRRSV disease 
resistance breeding."
1946,"Pigs have become an ideal model system for human disease research and 
development and an important farm animal that provides a valuable source of 
nutrition. To profile the all-sided gene expression and their biological 
functions across multiple tissues, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of gene 
expression on a large scale around the side of housekeeping genes (HKGs), tissue 
specific genes (TSGs), and the co-expressed genes in 14 various tissues. In this 
study, we identified 2351 HKGs and 3018 TSGs across tissues, among which 4 HKGs 
(COX1, UBB, OAZ1/NPFF) exhibited low variation and high expression levels, and 
31 particular TSGs (e.g., PDC, FKBP6, STAT2, and COL1A1) were exclusively 
expressed in several tissues, including endocrine brain, ovaries, livers, 
backfat, jejunum, kidneys, lungs, and longissimus dorsi muscles. We also 
obtained 17 modules with 230 hub genes (HUBGs) by weighted gene co-expression 
network analysis. On the other hand, HKGs functions were enriched in the 
signaling pathways of the ribosome, spliceosome, thermogenesis, oxidative 
phosphorylation, and nucleocytoplasmic transport, which have been highly 
suggested to involve in the basic biological tissue activities. While TSGs were 
highly enriched in the signaling pathways that were involved in specific 
physiological processes, such as the ovarian steroidogenesis pathway in ovaries 
and the renin-angiotensin system pathway in kidneys. Collectively, these stable, 
specifical, and co-expressed genes provided useful information for the 
investigation of the molecular mechanism for an understanding of the genetic and 
biological processes of complex traits in pigs."
1947,"Molecular breeding can accelerate the process of animal breeding and improve the 
breeding efficiency. To date, many Indel molecular markers have been identified 
in livestock and poultry, but how Indels affect economic traits is not well 
understood. For molecular breeding, it is crucial to reveal the mechanism of 
action of Indels and to provide more accurate information. The purpose of this 
study was to investigate how the 52/224-bp multiallelic Indels of the chicken 
QPCTL promoter area affect the daily weight gain of chickens and the potential 
regulatory mechanism of the QPCTL gene. The analysis was conducted by 
association analysis, qPCR, dual-fluorescence assay and Western blotting. The 
results showed that Indels in the QPCTL promoter region were significantly 
associated with the daily weight gain in chickens and that QPCTL expression 
showed a decreasing trend in embryonic breast muscle tissues. Furthermore, QPCTL 
expression was significantly higher in breast muscle tissues of the AC genotype 
than in those of the AB and BB genotypes. Based on the transcriptional activity 
results, the pGL3-C vector produced more luciferase activity than pGL3-A and 
pGL3-B. In addition, overexpression of QPCTL promoted chicken primary myoblast 
(CPM) proliferation and inhibited differentiation. The results of this study 
suggest that Indels in the promoter region of the QPCTL gene may regulate the 
proliferation and differentiation of CPMs by affecting the expression of QPCTL, 
which ultimately affects the growth rate of chickens. These Indels have 
important value for the molecular breeding of chickens, and QPCTL can be used as 
a candidate gene to regulate and improve chicken growth and development."
1948,"GPX2 has been recognized as a potential candidate gene for feed efficiency in 
pigs. This article aimed to elucidate polymorphism of GPX2 associated with feed 
efficiency and its related molecular mechanism. In this study, seven single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of GPX2 were found among 383 Duroc pigs. In 
addition, seven SNPs and ALGA0043483 (PorcineSNP60 BeadChip data in 600 Duroc 
pigs), which are near the GPX2 gene, were identified in one haplotypes block. 
Furthermore, associated studies showed that the genotype of GPX2 has significant 
association with weaning weight and 100 kg BF in Duroc pigs. In addition, the AG 
had no effect when the backfat became thinner, and the FCR and RFI traits had a 
tendency to decrease in the G3 + TT combination genotype, accompanied by an 
increase of GPX2 expression in backfat and muscle tissues. At the cellular 
level, the adipocyte proliferation and ability of adipogenic differentiation 
were reduced, and the lipid degradation increased in 3T3-L1 when there was 
overexpression of GPX2. In contrast, overexpression of the GPX2 gene can promote 
the muscle cell proliferation and myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells. In 
other words, GPX2 has the effect of reducing fat deposition and promoting muscle 
development, and it is a candidate gene for backfat and feed efficiency."
1949,"Body conformation traits assessed based on visual scores are widely used in Zebu 
cattle breeding programs. The aim of this study was to identify genomic regions 
and biological pathways associated with body conformation (CONF), finishing 
precocity (PREC), and muscling (MUSC) in Nellore cattle. The measurements based 
on visual scores were collected in 20,807 animals raised in pasture-based 
systems in Brazil. In addition, 2775 animals were genotyped using a 35 K SNP 
chip, which contained 31,737 single nucleotide polymorphisms after quality 
control. Single-step GWAS was performed using the BLUPF90 software while 
candidate genes were identified based on the Ensembl Genes 69. PANTHER and 
REVIGO platforms were used to identify key biological pathways and STRING to 
create gene networks. Novel candidate genes were revealed associated with CONF, 
including ALDH9A1, RXRG, RAB2A, and CYP7A1, involved in lipid metabolism. The 
genes associated with PREC were ELOVL5, PID1, DNER, TRIP12, and PLCB4, which are 
related to the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids, lipid metabolism, and muscle 
differentiation. For MUSC, the most important genes associated with muscle 
development were SEMA6A, TIAM2, UNC5A, and UIMC1. The polymorphisms identified 
in this study can be incorporated in commercial genotyping panels to improve the 
accuracy of genomic evaluations for visual scores in beef cattle."
1950,"Duck plague (DP) is a highly contagious viral disease in ducks caused by the 
duck plague virus (DPV). The DPV, a member of Herpesviridae, poses a severe 
threat to the waterfowl farming industry worldwide. In this study, we reported a 
recent outbreak of DPV in domestic laying ducks at 310 days of age from southern 
China in December 2021. The gross lesion, histopathologic examination, molecular 
detection, and genetic characterization studies of DPV are described here. As a 
result, gross lesions such as an enlarged congestive spleen and liver were 
observed. Liver with vacuolar degeneration and small vacuoles and spleen with 
hemosiderosis were remarkable microscopic findings. Our results suggested that 
the liver had the highest viral load, followed by the trachea, pancreas, kidney, 
brain, spleen, and heart. In addition, DPV was successfully isolated in chicken 
embryo fibroblast cell culture and designated as DP-GD-305-21. The UL2, UL12, 
UL41, UL47, and LORF11 genes of DP-GD-305-21 shared a high nucleotide homology 
with the Chinese virulent (CHv) strain and the Chinese variant (CV) strain. In 
conclusion, this study reports the isolation and molecular characterization of 
DPV from a recent outbreak in southern China. Our results contributed to the 
understanding of the pathological and molecular characterization of currently 
circulating DPV in China."
1951,"Diarrhea has been a global health problem for centuries, and the treatment has 
become increasingly difficult duo to the antibiotics overuse and resistance. 
Quercetin is a common flavonoid of extracts of vegetables, fruits, and 
traditional Chinese herbs, however, the mechanism of quercetin alleviating 
LPS-induced duodenal inflammation remains elusive. Specific pathogen-free 
chicken embryos (n = 120) were allocated to groups including control, PBS with 
or without alcohol, LPS (125 ng/egg) with or without quercetin (10, 20, or 40 
nmol/egg, respectively), and quercetin groups (10, 20, or 40 nmol/egg). Fifteen 
day-old embryonated eggs were inoculated with abovementioned solutions via the 
allantoic cavity. At embryonic day 19, the duodena of the embryos were collected 
for histopathological examination, RNA extraction and real-time polymerase chain 
reaction, immunohistochemical investigations, and Western blotting. The results 
demonstrated quercetin enhanced the inflammatory cell infiltration in the 
Peyer's patch of the intestinal mucosa after LPS induction. The LPS-induced 
expressions of these inflammation-related factors (TLR4, IL-1β, MMP3, MMP9, 
NFKB1, IFNγ, IL-8, IL-6) were completely blocked by quercetin. Quercetin also 
decreased the protein expression of TLR4, IL-1β, MMP3, and MMP9 after LPS 
induction. Quercetin could down-regulate autophagy gene expression (ATG5, LC3-1, 
LC3-2, and LKB1), and decreased the protein expression of ATG5, and LC3-1/LC3-2 
after LPS induction. Quercetin treatment prevented LPS-induced increases of the 
gene expressions of programmed cell death factors (TNFα, Fas, CASP1, CASP3, 
CASP12, Drp1, and RIPK1); meanwhile, quercetin decreased the protein expression 
of CASP1 and CASP3 after LPS challenge. LPS reduced the gene expression of mucin 
2, but upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of claudin 1, occludin, and 
ZO-1, and this was balanced by quercetin. This evidence suggests that quercetin 
can alleviate duodenal inflammation induced by LPS through modulating autophagy, 
programmed cell death, intestinal barrier function."
1952,"Developing nonantibiotic livestock growth promoters attracts intensive interest 
in the post-antibiotic era. In this study, we investigated the growth-promoting 
efficacy of Zhenqi granules (ZQ) in pigs and further explored the possible 
mechanisms by transcriptomics analysis. Weaned piglets (52 days old with an 
average body weight of 17.92 kg) were fed with diets supplemented with different 
doses of ZQ (0 g/kg, 1 g/kg, and 2 g/kg) for 30 days and continued observations 
for an additional 32 days after removing ZQ from the diets. Compared with the 
control group, the average daily gain, carcass weight, average back fat 
thickness, and fat meat percentage of the group supplemented with 1 g/kg of ZQ 
showed a significant increase, and the feed/gain ratio was lower. The group 
supplemented with 2 g/kg of ZQ also showed a significant increase in average 
daily gain and average backfat thickness. A transcriptomics analysis revealed 
that the supplementation of ZQ at 1 g/kg upregulated the expression of genes 
related to collagen biosynthesis and lipid biosynthesis in skeletal muscle and 
liver. This effect was primarily through upregulating the mRNA levels of 
structural proteins and lipid-related enzymes. This study demonstrates the 
growth-promoting efficacy of ZQ and provides some insights of the mechanism of 
growth promotion."
1953,"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is an important pathogen of the bovine 
respiratory disease complex (BRDC); however, its prevalence and molecular 
characteristics in China remain largely unknown. In this study, 788 nasal swabs 
from 51 beef cattle farms with BRDC outbreaks in 16 provinces and one 
municipality were collected from October 2020 to July 2022, and 18.65% (147/788) 
of samples from 23 farms across 11 provinces were detected as BRSV-positive by 
reverse transcription-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) assay. Further, 18 
complete G gene sequences were classified into BRSV subgroup III, and 25 
complete F gene sequences were obtained from 8 and 10 provinces. Compared to the 
known BRSV strains in GenBank, the G proteins and F proteins in this study 
shared several identical amino acid (aa) mutations. Moreover, five nearly 
complete genome sequences were obtained and clustered into a large branch with 
two America BRSV subgroup III strains (KU159366 and OM328114) rather than the 
sole Chinese strain (MT861050) but were located in an independent small branch. 
In conclusion, this study reveals that BRSV has a wide geographical distribution 
in China, and subgroup III strains, which have unique evolution characteristics, 
are the dominant strains. The results contribute to a better understanding of 
the prevalence and genetic evolution of BRSV."
1954,"An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of various dietary 
levels of garlic juice processing waste (GJPW) on the growth, feed utilization, 
digestive and antioxidant enzyme activity, growth- and antioxidant-related gene 
expression, and resistance to Streptococcus iniae infection of juvenile black 
rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii). A total of 450 juvenile rockfish were randomly 
distributed into 30 L rectangular tanks (30 fish per tank). Five experimental 
diets were prepared in triplicate. The fish were fed experimental diets 
supplemented with GJPW at concentrations of 0 (GJPW0, control), 2.5 (GJPW2.5), 5 
(GJPW5), 7.5 (GJPW7.5), and 10 g kg-1 (GJPW10) diet. All of the 
GJPW-supplemented treatments (2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 g kg-1) significantly enhanced 
weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency (FE), protein 
efficiency ratio (PER), and digestive enzyme activity (amylase, trypsin, and 
lipase). A decreasing trend was seen in plasma aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), 
alanine aminotransferase (AST), and glucose (GLU) content with increasing 
dietary levels of GJPW. In contrast, plasma lysozyme and antioxidant enzyme 
activities were significantly increased with increasing dietary GJPW levels. 
Furthermore, GJPW administration significantly upregulated the expression of 
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase 
(CAT), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the liver of rockfish. A challenge 
test with S. iniae showed significantly higher resistance in the 
GJPW-supplemented treatments than in the control. In short, dietary 
supplementation GJPW enhanced growth performance and antioxidant response in 
juvenile black rockfish, with suitable effects in fish fed with 2.5 g kg-1 GJPW 
for 8 weeks."
1955,"New Zealand has the fourth largest feral horse population in the world. The 
Kaimanawas (KHs) are feral horses descended from various domestic horse breeds 
released into the Kaimanawa ranges in the 19th and 20th centuries. Over time, 
the population size has fluctuated dramatically due to hunting, large-scale 
farming and forestry. Currently, the herd is managed by an annual round-up, 
limiting the number to 300 individuals to protect the native ecosystem. Here, we 
genotyped 96 KHs for uniparental markers (mitochondrial DNA, Y-chromosome) and 
assessed their genetic similarity with respect to other domestic horses. We show 
that at least six maternal and six paternal lineages contributed unequally to 
the KH gene pool, and today's KH population possibly represents two 
sub-populations. Our results indicate that three horse breeds, namely Welsh 
ponies, Thoroughbreds and Arabian horses had a major influence in the 
genetic-makeup of the extant KH population. We show that mitochondrial genetic 
diversity in KHs (π = 0.00687 ± 0.00355) is closer to that of the Sable Island 
horses (π = 0.0034 ± 0.00301), and less than other feral horse populations 
around the world. Our current findings, combined with ongoing genomic research, 
will provide insight into the population-specific genetic variation and 
inbreeding among KHs. This will largely advance equine research and improve the 
management of future breeding programs of these treasured New Zealand horse."
1956,"In this study, genome-wide CNVs were identified using a total of 469 horses from 
four horse populations (Jeju horses, Thoroughbreds, Jeju riding horses, and 
Hanla horses). We detected a total of 843 CNVRs throughout all autosomes: 281, 
30, 301, and 310 CNVRs for Jeju horses, Thoroughbreds, Jeju riding horses, and 
Hanla horses, respectively. Of the total CNVRs, copy number losses were found to 
be the most abundant (48.99%), while gains and mixed CNVRs accounted for 41.04% 
and 9.96% of the total CNVRs, respectively. The length of the CNVRs ranged from 
0.39 kb to 2.8 Mb, while approximately 7.2% of the reference horse genome 
assembly was covered by the total CNVRs. By comparing the CNVRs among the 
populations, we found a significant portion of the CNVRs (30.13%) overlapped; 
the highest number of shared CNVRs was between Hanla horses and Jeju riding 
horses. When compared with the horse CNVRs of previous studies, 26.8% of CNVRs 
were found to be uniquely detected in this study. The CNVRs were not randomly 
distributed throughout the genome; in particular, the Equus caballus autosome 
(ECA) 7 comprised the largest proportion of its genome (16.3%), while ECA 24 
comprised the smallest (0.7%). Furthermore, functional analysis was applied to 
CNVRs that overlapped with genes (genic-CNVRs); these overlapping areas may be 
potentially associated with the olfactory pathway and nervous system. A racing 
performance QTL was detected in a CNVR of Thoroughbreds, Jeju riding horses, and 
Hanla horses, and the CNVR value was mixed for three breeds."
1957,"The level of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is associated with the growth 
of the antler, a fast-growing bone organ of Cervidae. However, the benefits of 
25(OH)D supplementation on antler growth and the underlying mechanisms remain 
unclear. Here, the antler growth profile and transcriptome, plasma parameters, 
rumen bacteria, and metabolites (volatile fatty acids and amino acids) were 
determined in sika deer in a 25(OH)D supplementation group (25(OH)D, n = 8) and 
a control group (Ctrl, n = 8). 25(OH)D supplementation significantly increased 
the antler weight and growth rate. The levels of IGF-1,25(OH)D and 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were significantly higher in the 25(OH)D group than in 
the Ctrl group, while the levels of LDL-C were lower. The levels of valerate and 
branched-chain amino acids in the rumen fluid were significantly different 
between the 25(OH)D and Ctrl groups. The bacterial diversity indices were not 
significantly different between the two groups. However, the relative abundances 
of the butyrate-producing bacteria (families Lachnospiraceae and 
Succinivibrionaceae) and the pyruvate metabolism pathway were higher in the 
25(OH)D group. The transcriptomic profile of the antler was significantly 
different between the 25(OH)D and Ctrl groups, with 356 up- and 668 
down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 25(OH)D group. The 
up-regulated DEGs were enriched in the proteinaceous extracellular matrix and 
collagen, while the down-regulated DEGs were enriched in the immune system and 
lipid metabolism pathways. Overall, these results provide novel insights into 
the effects of 25(OH)D supplementation on the host metabolism, rumen microbiota, 
and antler transcriptome of sika deer."
1958,"Ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), ghrelin, and GHSR have been reported to play 
important roles that influence feed intake in mammals. LEAP2, an endogenous 
antagonist of GHSR, plays an important role in the regulation of feed intake. 
However, chicken ghrelin has also been reported to have an inhibitory effect on 
feed intake. The role of the GOAT-Ghrelin-GHSR-LEAP2 axis in chicken-feed intake 
remains unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically evaluate the 
changes in the tissue expression levels of these genes under different energy 
states. In this study, broiler chicks in different energy states were subjected 
to starvation and feeding, and relevant gene expression levels were measured 
using quantitative real-time PCR. Different energy states significantly 
modulated the expression levels of LEAP2 and GHSR but did not significantly 
affect the expression levels of GOAT and ghrelin. A high expression level of 
LEAP2 was detected in the liver and the whole small intestine. Compared to the 
fed group, the fasted chicks showed significantly reduced LEAP2 expression 
levels in the liver and the small intestine; 2 h after being refed, the LEAP2 
expression of the fasted chicks returned to the level of the fed group. 
Transcription factor prediction and results of a dual luciferase assay indicated 
that the transcription factor CDX4 binds to the LEAP2 promoter region and 
positively regulates its expression. High expression levels of GHSR were 
detected in the hypothalamus and pituitary. Moreover, we detected GHSR highly 
expressed in the jejunum-this finding has not been previously reported. Thus, 
GHSR may regulate intestinal motility, and this aspect needs further 
investigation. In conclusion, this study revealed the function of chicken LEAP2 
as a potential feed-intake regulator and identified the potential mechanism 
governing its intestine-specific expression. Our study lays the foundations for 
future studies on avian feed-intake regulation."
1959,"Nasturtium officinale contains high amounts of phytochemical compounds that work 
against oxidative damages leading to improved health conditions in animals as 
well as humans. The study was performed to investigate the health benefits of 
nonencapsulated and nanoliposome-encapsulated phenolic rich fractions obtained 
from Nasturtium officinale on mice induced colorectal cancer. The experiment 
focused on encapsulation efficiency in improving the effectiveness of plant 
bioactive compounds. Phenolic rich fractions (PRF) were successfully loaded in 
the nanoliposome structure, a nanometer in size, of spherical shape and with 
homogeneous dispersion. Induction of colorectal cancer in mice impaired weight 
gain and feed intake, liver function and structural characteristics of ileum, 
while the dietary administration of nanoliposome-encapsulated PRF regulated the 
expression of Caspase 3, Bax, Bcl2, iNOS and SOD genes in the tumor tissue. The 
addition of nonencapsulated PRF and nanoliposome encapsulated PRF at the 
concentration of 100 mg TPC/kg BW/day improved the genes expression, although 
the nanoliposome-encapsulated PRF revealed better health outcomes compared to 
nonencapsulated PRF. Furthermore, both PRF improved intestinal morphology when 
the mice were challenged with colorectal cancer. The higher health promoting 
activity of nanoliposome-encapsulated PRF could be associated with its enhanced 
intestinal absorption, bioavailability, bioaccessibility and bioactivity. 
Consequently, the nanoliposome-encapsulated PRF could be considered as a 
promising anticancer agent against colorectal cancer."
1960,"The protozoan Sarcocystis bertrami (syn. Sarcocystis fayeri) infects horses and 
has dogs as definitive hosts. Herein we aimed to detect S. bertrami in Brazilian 
horses destined for human consumption and to determine the frequency of 
infection in the examined animals. Muscle fragments from 51 horses were 
collected in a slaughterhouse in Bahia State during three different seasons of 
the year. Samples from six tissues from each animal were prepared for 
macroscopic and microscopic evaluation, using tissue grinding, squash and 
histology. Sarcocystis sp. was observed in 100% of the examined horses. Selected 
samples were processed for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Species 
identification was confirmed using a PCR targeted to the mitochondrial 
cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1). Histological examination revealed 
sarcocysts with variable sizes and shapes, and dispersed within the muscle 
fibers. When observed by TEM, the sarcocyst wall was wavy and covered by an 
electrodense layer. The villar protrusions were digitiform and bent. To our 
knowledge, this study is the first morphological and molecular confirmation of 
S. bertrami in horses in Brazil and South America."
1961,"Agriophyllum squarrosum (sand rice), a widespread desert plant, possesses 
anti-hyperglycemic and anti-inflammatory properties, and has been used in 
traditional Chinese medicine for many years. However, its effects on ruminants 
are unknown. To fill this gap, we examined the effects of A. squarrosum on the 
immune and anti-inflammatory responses of lambs. A total of 23, 6-month-old Tan 
ewe-lambs (27.6 ± 0.47 kg) were divided into four groups and offered a basic 
diet (C-control), or a diet that contained 10%, 20%, or 30% A. squarrosum, on a 
dry matter basis, for 128 days. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol were 
lower (p = 0.004) in the 30% supplemented lambs than controls, while 
concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower (p = 0.006) in 
the 10% and 20%, but not in 30% supplemented lambs than controls. Serum-cortisol 
concentrations were lower (p = 0.012) in the 30% supplemented lambs and free 
fatty acid concentrations were higher in the 10% and 20% supplemented lambs than 
in control lambs (p &lt; 0.001). Supplementation with A. squarrosum decreased (p 
&lt; 0.05) the area of adipocytes in subcutaneous adipose tissue, but there was 
no difference between the 20% and 30% diets. Conversely, the area in visceral 
adipose tissue (VAT) increased (p &lt; 0.05), especially for the 10% and 20% 
supplemented diets. Supplementation with A. squarrosum also enriched immune and 
anti-inflammatory related and lipid and glucose-metabolic pathways and 
associated differentially expressed gene expressions in adipose tissue. A total 
of 10 differential triacylglycerol, 34 differential phosphatidylcholines and 
seven differential phosphatidylethanolamines decreased in the diet with 30% 
supplementation, when compared to the other diets. Finally, 
adipocyte-differentiation genes, and immune and inflammatory response-related 
gene expression levels decreased in lamb adipocytes cultured with an aqueous A. 
squarrosum extract. In conclusion, supplementing lamb diets with A. squarrosum 
reduced blood lipids, enhanced immunity and anti-inflammatory capacities, and 
mediated lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and adipocytes of Tan lambs. A level 
of approximately 10% is recommended, but further research is required to 
determine the precise optimal level."
1962,"In the present study, we analyzed the combination of non-toxic concentrations 
per se, of Cd and a pesticide the imidacloprid (IMI) (10 and 50 μM for Cd and 
195 μM for IMI), to highlight early developmental toxicity and possible damage 
to retinal cells. Co-exposure to Cd and IMI showed a toxic effect in zebrafish 
larval development, with lowered degrees of survival and hatching, and in some 
cases the induction of structural alterations and edema. In addition, 
co-exposure to 50 and 195 μM, respectively, for Cd and IMI, also showed 
increased apoptosis in eye cells, accompanied by up regulation of genes 
associated with antioxidant markers (cat, sod1, nrf2 and ho-1). Thus, the 
present study aims to highlight how the presence of multiple contaminants, even 
at low concentrations, can be a risk factor in a model of zebrafish (Danio 
rerio). The presence of other contaminants, such as IMI, can cause an 
enhancement of the toxic action of Cd on morphological changes in the early life 
stage of zebrafish, but more importantly disrupt the normal development of the 
retina, eventually triggering apoptosis."
1963,"this study aimed to investigate the growth mechanism in a local breed of 
chickens by comparing the highest weight (HW) and the lowest weight in their 
microbiota, histological characteristics, and gene expression. Golden Montazah 
chickens, an Egyptian breed, were reared until they were 49 days old. All of the 
birds were fed ad libitum by a starter diet from day 1 until day 21, followed by 
a grower diet from day 21 to the end of the study. At 49 days old, the 
forty-eight birds with the heaviest body weight (HW) and the lightest body 
weight (LW) were chosen. Blood biochemical and histological morphometric 
parameters, electron microscopy, and intestinal nutrient transporter gene 
expression were studied in the sampled jejunum. The microbial composition and 
functions of the content and mucosa in HW and LW chickens were studied using 16S 
rRNA gene sequencing. The histological morphometric parameters were all more 
significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased in the HW chickens than in the LW 
chickens. Total protein, albumin, and triglycerides in serum were significantly 
higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the HW chickens than in the LW chickens. The microbiome 
profile in the gut showed that Microbacterium and Sphingomonas were positively 
correlated with the body weights. In the local breed, there were significant 
differences in the intestinal microstructure which could enhance the growth 
mechanism and body weight. Our findings showed that some microbial components 
were significantly associated with body weight and their interactions with the 
host could be inferred to explain why these interactions might alter the host's 
metabolic responses. Further investigation into combining bioinformatics with 
lab experiments in chickens will help us to understand how gut bacteria can 
change the host's metabolism by special metabolic features in the 
gastrointestinal system."
1964,"The aim of the current study was to identify the major genes and pathways 
involved in the process of hypertrophy and skeletal muscle maturation that is 
common for Bos taurus, Ovis aries, and Sus scrofa species. Gene expression 
profiles related to Bos taurus, Ovis aries, and Sus scrofa muscle, with 
accession numbers GSE44030, GSE23563, and GSE38518, respectively, were 
downloaded from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were 
screened out using the Limma package of R software. Genes with Fold Change &gt; 
2 and an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 were identified as significantly different 
between two treatments in each species. Subsequently, gene ontology and pathway 
enrichment analyses were performed. Moreover, hub genes were detected by 
creating a protein-protein interaction network (PPI). The results of the 
analysis in Bos taurus showed that in the period of 280 dpc-3-months old, a 
total of 1839 genes showed a significant difference. In Ovis aries, however, 
during the period of 135dpc-2-months old, a total of 486 genes were 
significantly different. Additionally, in the 91 dpc-adult period, a total of 
2949 genes were significantly different in Sus scrofa. The results of the KEGG 
pathway enrichment analysis and GO function annotation in each species 
separately revealed that in Bos taurus, DEGs were mainly enriched through 
skeletal muscle fiber development and skeletal muscle contraction, and the 
positive regulation of fibroblast proliferation, positive regulation of skeletal 
muscle fiber development, PPAR signaling pathway, and HIF-1 signaling pathway. 
In Ovis aries, DEGs were mainly enriched through regulating cell growth, 
skeletal muscle fiber development, the positive regulation of fibroblast 
proliferation, skeletal muscle cell differentiation, and the PI3K-Akt signaling, 
HIF-1 signaling, and Rap1 signaling pathways. In Sus scrofa, DEGs were mainly 
enriched through regulating striated muscle tissue development, the negative 
regulation of fibroblast proliferation and myoblast differentiation, and the 
HIF-1 signaling, AMPK signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Using a Venn 
diagram, 36 common DEGs were identified between Bos taurus, Ovis aries, and Sus 
scrofa. A biological pathways analysis of 36 common DEGs in Bos taurus, Ovis 
aries, and Sus scrofa allowed for the identification of common 
pathways/biological processes, such as myoblast differentiation, the regulation 
of muscle cell differentiation, and positive regulation of skeletal muscle fiber 
development, that orchestrated the development and maturation of skeletal 
muscle. As a result, hub genes were identified, including PPARGC1A, MYOD1, 
EPAS1, IGF2, CXCR4, and APOA1, in all examined species. This study provided a 
better understanding of the relationships between genes and their biological 
pathways in the skeletal muscle maturation process."
1965,"Restrictions on antibiotics are driving the search for alternative feed 
additives to promote gastrointestinal health and development in broiler chicken 
production. Proteins including antimicrobial peptides can potentially be applied 
as alternatives to antibiotics and are one of the most promising alternatives. 
We investigated whether the addition of MPX to the diet affects the production 
performance, immune function and the intestinal flora of the caecal contents of 
broiler chickens. One hundred one-day-old chickens were randomly divided into 
two groups: control (basal diet) and MPX (20 mg/kg) added to the basal diet. The 
results indicated that dietary supplementation with MPX improved the performance 
and immune organ index, decreased the feed conversion ratio, increased the 
villus length, maintained the normal intestinal morphology and reduced the IL-6 
and LITNF mRNA expression levels of inflammation-related genes. In addition, MPX 
increased the mRNA expression of the digestive enzymes FABP2 and SLC2A5/GLUT5 
and the tight junction proteins ZO-1, Claudin-1, Occludin, JAM-2 and MUC2, 
maintained the intestinal permeability and regulated the intestinal morphology. 
Moreover, MPX increased the CAT, HMOX1 and SOD1 mRNA expression levels of the 
antioxidant genes. Furthermore, a 16S rRNA microflora analysis indicated that 
the abundance of Lactobacillus and Lactococcus in the cecum was increased after 
addition of MPX at 14 d and 28 d. This study explored the feasibility of using 
antimicrobial peptides as novel feed additives for broiler chickens and provides 
a theoretical basis for their application in livestock."
1966,"Previous studies have found that the copy number variation (CNV) and 
insertion/deletion (indels) located in the sorting nexin 29 (SNX29) gene, which 
is an important candidate gene related to meat production and quality, are 
associated with growth traits of African goats and Shaanbei white cashmere 
goats. However, the genetic effects of SNX29 genetic variation on growth traits 
of Xiangdong black (XDB) goat (a representative meat goat breed in China) are 
still unclear. The purpose of this study was to detect the mRNA expression level 
of SNX29 and to explore the genetic effects of CNV and indel within SNX29 on 
growth traits and gene expression in XDB goat. The SNX29 mRNA expression profile 
showed that the SNX29 was highly expressed in adipose tissues, indicating that 
the SNX29 gene could play a key role in subcutaneous adipose deposition of XDB 
goat. 17 bp indel (g.10559298-10559314), 21 bp indel (g.10918982-10919002) and 
CNV were detected in 516 individuals of XDB goat by PCR or qPCR. The association 
analysis of SNX29 CNV with growth traits in XDB goats showed that SNX29 CNV was 
significantly correlated with chest circumference and abdominal circumference (p 
&lt; 0.01), and the normal type of SNX29 CNV goat individuals were more 
advantageous. For the mRNA expression of SNX29 gene, individuals with SNX29 copy 
number normal type had a higher trend than that of SNX29 gene with copy number 
gain type in longissimus dorsi muscle (p = 0.07), whereas individuals with SNX29 
copy number gain type had a higher trend in abdominal adipose (p = 0.09). 
Overall, these results suggested that the SNX29 gene could play an important 
role in growth and development of XDB goats and could be used for 
marker-assisted selection (MAS) in XDB goats."
1967,"Transferrin is an important iron-binding glycosylated protein and plays key 
roles in iron-binding and immune response. Here, a 2037-bp open reading frame 
was obtained from our previous transcriptome sequencing data of Amur 
stickleback, which encoded a 679 amino acid putative transferrin protein 
harbored obvious N-lobe and C-lobe domains. The tissue-specific expression 
pattern showed that the transcript was detected in a variety of tissues, with 
the highest signal in liver. Moreover, Streptococcus iniae pathogen stimulation 
can increase the expression level of this transcript, implying important immune 
properties for organisms. Next, N-lobes and C-lobes were obtained from 45 fish 
species. The phylogenetic tree showed that N-lobes and C-lobes were in two 
different evolutionary branches, and they had different motif composition. 
Functional divergence indicated a higher evolutionary rate or site-specific 
alteration among the N-lobe and C-lobe groups. Ka/Ks value of C-lobe group was 
relatively higher than that of N-lobe group, indicating a faster change rate of 
C-lobe sequences in evolution. Moreover, some sites experiencing positive 
selection were also found, which may be involved in the iron- or anion-binding, 
pathogen resistance and diversification of transferrin protein. Differential 
iron-binding activity was also detected between N-lobe and C-lobe of Amur 
stickleback transferrin protein with Chrome Azurol S assay. Compared with the 
C-lobe, the N-lobe showed stronger growth inhibitory activity of Escherichia 
coli, implying their potential antibacterial properties. This study will give a 
reference for subsequent research of transferrin proteins."
1968,"The cilia- and flagella-associated protein 43 (CFAP43) gene encodes a member of 
the cilia- and flagellum-associated protein family. Cilia on the cell surface 
influence intercellular signaling and are involved in biological processes such 
as osteogenesis and energy metabolism in animals. Previous studies have shown 
that insertion/deletion (InDel) variants in the CFAP43 gene affect litter size 
in Shaanbei white cashmere (SBWC) goats, and that litter size and body traits 
are correlated in this breed. Therefore, we hypothesized that there is a 
significant relationship between InDel variants within the CFAP43 gene and body 
traits in SBWC goats. Herein, we first investigated the association between 
three InDel variant loci (L-13, L-16, and L-19 loci) within CFAP43 and body 
traits in SBWC goats (n = 1827). Analyses revealed that the L-13, L-16, and L-19 
loci were significantly associated with chest depth, four body traits, and three 
body traits, respectively. The results of this study are in good agreement with 
those previously reported and could provide useful molecular markers for the 
selection and breeding of goats for body traits."
1969,"It is believed that polar regions are influenced by global warming more 
significantly, and because polar regions are less affected by human activities, 
they have certain reference values for future predictions. This study aimed to 
investigate the effects of climate warming on soil microbial communities in lake 
areas, taking Kitezh Lake, Antarctica as the research area. Below-peak soil, 
intertidal soil, and sediment were taken at the sampling sites, and we 
hypothesized that the diversity and composition of the bacterial and archaeal 
communities were different among the three sampling sites. Through 16S rDNA 
sequencing and analysis, bacteria and archaea with high abundance were obtained. 
Based on canonical correspondence analysis and redundancy analysis, pH and 
phosphate had a great influence on the bacterial community whereas pH and 
nitrite had a great influence on the archaeal community. Weighted gene 
coexpression network analysis was used to find the hub bacteria and archaea 
related to geochemical factors. The results showed that in addition to pH, 
phosphate, and nitrite, moisture content, ammonium, nitrate, and total carbon 
content also play important roles in microbial diversity and structure at 
different sites by changing the abundance of some key microbiota."
1970,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is highly aggressive with poor patient outcomes, 
and a deeper understanding of ovarian cancer tumorigenesis could help guide 
future treatment development. We proposed an optimized hit network-target sets 
model to systematically characterize the underlying pathological mechanisms and 
intra-tumoral heterogeneity in human ovarian cancer. Using TCGA data, we 
constructed an epithelial ovarian cancer regulatory network in this study. We 
use three distinct methods to produce different HNSs for identification of the 
driver genes/nodes, core modules, and core genes/nodes. Following the creation 
of the optimized HNS (OHNS) by the integration of DN (driver nodes), CM (core 
module), and CN (core nodes), the effectiveness of various HNSs was assessed 
based on the significance of the network topology, control potential, and 
clinical value. Immunohistochemical (IHC), qRT-PCR, and Western blotting were 
adopted to measure the expression of hub genes and proteins involved in 
epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We discovered that the OHNS has two key 
advantages: the network's central location and controllability. It also plays a 
significant role in the illness network due to its wide range of capabilities. 
The OHNS and clinical samples revealed the endometrial cancer signaling, and the 
PI3K/AKT, NER, and BMP pathways. MUC16, FOXA1, FBXL2, ARID1A, COX15, COX17, 
SCO1, SCO2, NDUFA4L2, NDUFA, and PTEN hub genes were predicted and may serve as 
potential candidates for new treatments and biomarkers for EOC. This research 
can aid in better capturing the disease progression, the creation of potent 
multi-target medications, and the direction of the therapeutic community in the 
optimization of effective treatment regimens by various research objectives in 
cancer treatment."
1971,"Abdominal fat percentage (AFP) is an important economic trait in chickens. 
Intensive growth selection has led to the over-deposition of abdominal fat in 
chickens, but the genetic basis of AFP is not yet clear. Using 520 female 
individuals from selection and control lines of Jingxing yellow chicken, we 
investigated the genetic basis of AFP using a genome-wide association study 
(GWAS) and fixation indices (FST). A 0.15 MB region associated with AFP was 
located on chromosome 27 and included nine significant single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs), which could account for 3.34-5.58% of the phenotypic 
variation. In addition, the π value, genotype frequency, and dual-luciferase 
results identified SNP rs312715211 in the intron region of ZNF652 as the key 
variant. The wild genotype was associated with lower AFP and abdominal fat 
weight (AFW), but higher body weight (BW). Finally, annotated genes based on the 
top 1% SNPs were used to investigate the physiological function of ZNF652. Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis suggested that ZNF652 may 
reduce AFW and BW in broilers through the TGF-β1/SMad2/3 and MAPK/FoxO pathways 
via EGFR and TGFB1. Our findings elucidated the genetic basis of chicken AFP, 
rs312715211 on the ZNF652 gene, which can affect BW and AFW and was the key 
variant associated with AFP. These data provide new insight into the genetic 
mechanism underlying AF deposition in chickens and could be beneficial in 
breeding chickens for AF."
1972,"Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is an opportunistic pathogen associated 
with nosocomial infections. In this study, 100 raw milk samples were collected 
from Qena, Egypt, and subjected to conventional and molecular assays to 
determine the presence of A. baumannii and investigate their antimicrobial 
resistance and biofilm formation. Our findings revealed that, among the 100 
samples, Acinetobacter spp. were found in 13 samples based on CHROM agar 
results. We further characterized them using rpoB and 16S-23SrRNA sequencing and 
gyrB multiplex PCR analysis and confirmed that 9 out of the 13 Acinetobacter 
spp. isolates were A. baumannii and 4 were other species. The A. baumannii 
isolates were resistant to β-lactam drugs, including cefotaxime (44%), 
ampicillin-sulbactam and levofloxacin (33.3% for each), imipenem, meropenem and 
aztreonam (22.2% for each). We observed different antimicrobial resistance 
patterns, with a multi-antibiotic resistant (MAR) index ranging from 0.2 to 0.3. 
According to the PCR results, blaOXA-51 and blaOXA-23 genes were amplified in 
100% and 55.5% of the A. baumannii isolates, respectively, while the blaOXA-58 
gene was not amplified. Furthermore, the metallo-β-lactamases (MBL) genes blaIMP 
and blaNDM were found in 11.1% and 22.2% of isolates, respectively, while blaVIM 
was not amplified. Additionally, eight A. baumannii isolates (88.8%) produced 
black-colored colonies on Congo red agar, demonstrating their biofilm production 
capacity. These results showed that, besides other foodborne pathogens, raw milk 
should also be examined for A. baumannii, which could be a public health 
concern."
1973,"By expressing different genes and proteins that regulate osteoclast as well as 
osteoblast formation, osteocytes orchestrate bone metabolism. The aim of this 
project was the evaluation of the differences in the osteocytes' secretory 
activity in the low bone mass mouse strain C57BL/6J and the high bone mass 
strain C3H/J. The femura of eight- and sixteen-week-old male C57BL/6J and C3H/J 
mice-six animals per group-were analyzed. Using immunohistochemistry, osteocytes 
expressing dickkopf 1, sclerostin, periostin, fibroblast growth factor 23 
(FGF23), and osteoprotegerin were detected. By means of the OsteoMeasure-System, 
92.173 osteocytes were counted. At the age of eight weeks, approximately twice 
as many cortical and trabecular osteocytes from the C57BL/6J mice compared to 
the C3H/J mice expressed dickkopf 1 (p &lt; 0.005). The number of cortical 
osteocytes expressing sclerostin was also higher in the C57BL/6J mice (p &lt; 
0.05). In contrast, the cortical and trabecular osteocytes expressing periostin 
were twice as high in the C3H/J mice (p &lt; 0.005). The dickkopf 1 expressing 
osteocytes of the C57BL/6J mice decreased with age and showed a strain-specific 
difference only in cortical bone by 16 weeks of age (p &lt; 0.05). In the C3H/J 
mice, the amount of osteocytes expressing periostin tended to increase with age. 
Thus, strain-related differences were maintained in 16-week-old rodents (p &lt; 
0.005). No strain-specific differences in the expression of FGF23 or 
osteoprotegerin in the cortical compartment could be detected. This experimental 
study showed that the osteocytes' protein expression reflects differences in 
bone characteristics and strain-related differences during skeletal maturation. 
Besides the osteocytes' expression of sclerostin, their expression of dickkopf 1 
and periostin seems to be important for bone properties as well."
1974,"Environmental drought stress threatens rice production. Previous studies have 
reported that related NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC) transcription factors play an 
important role in drought stress. Herein, we identified and characterized 
OsNAC092, encoding an NAC transcription factor that is highly expressed and 
induced during drought tolerance. OsNAC092 knockout lines created using the 
clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 
9 (Cas9) system exhibited increased drought resistance in rice. RNA sequencing 
showed that the knockout of OsNAC092 caused a global expression change, and 
differential gene expression is chiefly associated with ""response to light 
stimulus,"" ""MAPK signaling pathway,"" ""plant hormone signal transduction,"" 
""response to oxidative stress,"" ""photosynthesis,"" and ""water deprivation."" In 
addition, the antioxidants and enzyme activities of the redox response were 
significantly increased. OsNAC092 mutant rice exhibited a higher ability to 
scavenge more ROS and maintained a high GSH/GSSG ratio and redox level under 
drought stress, which could protect cells from oxidant stress, revealing the 
importance of OsNAC092 in the rice's response to abiotic stress. Functional 
analysis of OsNAC092 will be useful to explore many rice resistance genes in 
molecular breeding to aid in the development of modern agriculture."
1975,"Stress-inducible promoters are vital for the desirable expression of genes, 
especially transcription factors, which could otherwise compromise growth and 
development when constitutively overexpressed in plants. Here, we report on the 
characterization of the promoter region of a stress-responsive gene SaAsr1 from 
monocot halophyte cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Several cis-acting 
elements, such as ABRE (ABA-responsive element), DRE-CRT (dehydration 
responsive-element/C-Repeat), LTRE (low temperature-responsive element), ERE 
(ethylene-responsive element), LRE (light-responsive element), etc. contributed 
at varying degrees to salt-, drought- and ABA-enhanced expression of gusA 
reporter gene in Arabidopsis&amp;nbsp;thaliana under the full-length promoter, 
pAsr11875 and its deletion derivatives with an assortment of cis-regulatory 
motifs. The smallest promoter, pAsr1491, with three cis-acting elements (a CCAAT 
box-heat responsive, an LRE, and a copper responsive element) conferred 
drought-enhanced expression of gusA; pAsr1755 (with an ABRE and a DRE) presented 
the highest expression in ABA and drought; and pAsr1994 with seven ABREs and two 
DREs conferred optimal induction of gusA, especially under drought and ABA. 
Arabidopsis transgenics expressing a known abiotic stress-responsive gene, 
SaADF2 (actin depolymerization factor 2), under both pAsr11875 and p35S 
promoters outperformed the wild type (WT) with enhanced drought and salt 
tolerance contributed by higher relative water content and membrane stability 
with no significant difference between pAsr11875:SaADF2 or p35S:SaADF2 lines. 
However, pAsr11875:SaADF2 lines produced healthy plants with robust shoot 
systems under salt stress and control compared to slightly stunted growth of the 
p35S:SaADF2 plants. This reestablished the evidence that transgene expression 
under a stress-inducible promoter is a better strategy for the genetic 
manipulation of crops."
1976,"SARS-CoV-2 infections are highly correlated with the overexpression of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines in what is known as a cytokine storm, leading to high 
fatality rates. Such infections are accompanied by SIRS, ARDS, and sepsis, 
suggesting a potential link between the three phenotypes. Currently, little is 
known about the transcriptional similarity between these conditions. Herein, 
weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) clustering was applied to 
RNA-seq datasets (GSE147902, GSE66890, GSE74224, GSE177477) to identify modules 
of highly co-expressed and correlated genes, cross referenced with dataset 
GSE160163, across the samples. To assess the transcriptome similarities between 
the conditions, module preservation analysis was performed and functional 
enrichment was analyzed in DAVID webserver. The hub genes of significantly 
preserved modules were identified, classified into upregulated or downregulated, 
and used to screen candidate drugs using Connectivity Map (CMap) to identify 
repurposed drugs. Results show that several immune pathways (chemokine 
signaling, NOD-like signaling, and Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation) are 
conserved across the four diseases. Hub genes screened using intramodular 
connectivity show significant relevance with the pathogenesis of cytokine 
storms. Transcriptomic-driven drug repurposing identified seven candidate drugs 
(SB-202190, eicosatetraenoic-acid, loratadine, TPCA-1, pinocembrin, mepacrine, 
and CAY-10470) that targeted several immune-related processes. These identified 
drugs warrant further study into their efficacy for treating cytokine storms, 
and in vitro and in vivo experiments are recommended to confirm the findings of 
this study."
1977,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a severe disease mostly caused by asbestos 
exposure. Today, one of the best available biomarkers is the soluble 
mesothelin-related protein (SMRP), also known as mesothelin. Recent studies have 
shown that mesothelin levels are influenced by individual genetic variability. 
This study aimed to investigate the influence of three mesothelin (MSLN) gene 
variants (SNPs) in the 5'-untranslated promoter region (5'-UTR), MSLN rs2235503 
C &gt; A, rs3764246 A &gt; G, rs3764247 A &gt; C, and one (rs1057147 G &gt; A) 
in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the MSLN gene on plasma concentrations 
of mesothelin in 410 asbestos-exposed males without cancer and 43 males with 
prediagnostic MM (i.e., with MM diagnosed later on) from the prospective MoMar 
study, as well as 59 males with manifest MM from Germany. The mesothelin 
concentration differed significantly between the different groups (p &lt; 
0.0001), but not between the prediagnostic and manifest MM groups (p = 0.502). 
Five to eight mutations of the four SNP variants studied were associated with 
increased mesothelin concentrations (p = 0.001). The highest mesothelin 
concentrations were observed for homozygous variants of the three promotor SNPs 
in the 5'-UTR (p &lt; 0.001), and the highest odds ratio for an elevated 
mesothelin concentration was observed for MSLN rs2235503 C &gt; A. The four 
studied SNPs had a clear influence on the mesothelin concentration in plasma. 
Hence, the analysis of these SNPs may help to elucidate the diagnostic 
background of patients displaying increased mesothelin levels and might help to 
reduce false-positive results when using mesothelin for MM screening in 
high-risk groups."
1978,"Mitigating the function of acquired transgenes in crop wild/weedy relatives can 
provide an ideal strategy to reduce the possible undesired environmental impacts 
of pollen-mediated transgene flow from genetically engineered (GE) crops. To 
explore a transgene mitigation system in rice, we edited the seed-shattering 
genes, SH4 and qSH1, using a weedy rice line (""C9"") that originally had strong 
seed shattering. We also analyzed seed size-related traits, the total genomic 
transcriptomic data, and RT-qPCR expression of the SH4 or qSH1 gene-edited and 
SH4/qSH1 gene-edited weedy rice lines. Substantially reduced seed shattering was 
observed in all gene-edited weedy rice lines. The single gene-edited weedy rice 
lines, either the SH4 or qSH1 gene, did not show a consistent reduction in their 
seed size-related traits. In addition, reduced seed shattering was closely 
linked with the weakness and absence of abscission layers and reduced abscisic 
acid (ABA). Additionally, the genes closely associated with ABA biosynthesis and 
signaling transduction, as well as cell-wall hydrolysis, were downregulated in 
all gene-edited weedy rice lines. These findings facilitate our deep insights 
into the underlying mechanisms of reduced seed shattering in plants in the rice 
genus Oryza. In addition, such a mitigating technology also has practical 
applications for reducing the potential adverse environmental impacts caused by 
transgene flow and for managing the infestation of weedy rice by acquiring the 
mitigator from GE rice cultivars through natural gene flow."
1979,"The influence of climate change on microbial communities inhabiting the sparsely 
vegetated patterned ground soils that are widespread across the High Arctic is 
poorly understood. Here, in a four-year experiment on Svalbard, we warmed 
patterned ground soil with open top chambers and biannually irrigated the soil 
to predict the responses of its microbial community to rising temperatures and 
precipitation. A 1 °C rise in summertime soil temperature caused 44% and 78% 
increases in CO2 efflux and CH4 consumption, respectively, and a 32% increase in 
the frequency of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Bacterial alpha diversity 
was unaffected by the treatments, but, of the 40 most frequent bacterial taxa, 
warming caused 44-45% reductions in the relative abundances of a Sphingomonas 
sp. and Ferruginibacter sp. and 33-91% increases in those of a Phenylobacterium 
sp. and a member of the Acetobacteraceae. Warming did not influence the 
frequency of fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 copies, and irrigation had no 
effects on the measured variables. Our study suggests rapid changes to the 
activities and abundances of microbes, and particularly bacteria, in High Arctic 
patterned ground soils as they warm. At current rates of soil warming on 
Svalbard (0.8 °C per decade), we anticipate that similar effects to those 
reported here will manifest themselves in the natural environment by 
approximately the mid 2030s."
1980,"Hydroxylated polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) are a unique class of flavonoid 
compounds mainly found in citrus plants. We investigated the anti-inflammatory 
effects of one major 5-hydroxy PMF, namely 5-demethylnobiletin (5DN) and its 
metabolites 5, 3'-didemethylnobiletin (M1), 5, 4'-didemethylnobiletin (M2), and 
5, 3', 4'-tridemethylnobiletin (M3) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 
264.7 macrophage cells. The results showed that M2 and M3 produced stronger 
inhibitory effects on the production of nitric oxide (NO) than their parent 
compound at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Western blotting and real-time PCR 
analyses demonstrated that M2 and M3 significantly decreased iNOS and COX-2 gene 
expression. The results also showed that M1 and M3 induced heme 
oxygenase-1(HO-1) gene expression. Overall, our results demonstrated that 
metabolites of 5DN significantly inhibited LPS-induced inflammation in RAW 264.7 
macrophage cells and generally possessed more potent anti-inflammatory activity 
than the parent compound, 5DN."
1981,"Paternal factors play an important role in embryonic morphogenesis and 
contribute to sexual dimorphism in development. To assess the effect of paternal 
DNA on sexual dimorphism of embryonic genome activation, we compared X and Y 
sperm and different sexes of embryos before sex determination. Through 
transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) 
of X and Y sperm, we found a big proportion of upregulated genes in Y sperm, 
supported by the observation that genome-wide DNA methylation level is slightly 
lower than in X sperm. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, TGF-beta, and 
toll-like receptor pathways play important roles in spermatogenesis. Through 
whole-genome re-sequencing (WGRS) of parental fish and RNA-seq of five early 
embryonic stages, we found the low-blastocyst time point is a key to maternal 
transcriptome degradation and zygotic genome activation. Generally, sexual 
differences emerged from the bud stage. Moreover, through integrated analysis of 
paternal SNPs and gene expression, we evaluated the influence of paternal 
inheritance on sexual dimorphism of genome activation. Besides, we screened out 
gata6 and ddx5 as potential instructors for early sex determination and gonad 
development in yellow catfish. This work is meaningful for revealing the 
molecular mechanisms of sex determination and sexual dimorphism of fish species."
1982,"Valine-glutamine (VQ) motif-containing proteins are a class of highly conserved 
transcriptional regulators in plants and play key roles in plant growth, 
development, and response to various stresses. However, the VQ family genes in 
mustard have not yet been comprehensively identified and analyzed. In this 
study, a total of 120 VQ family genes (BjuVQ1 to BjuVQ120), which were unevenly 
distributed on 18 chromosomes (AA_Chr01 to BB_Chr08), were characterized in 
mustard. A phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the BjuVQ proteins were 
clustered into nine distinct groups (groups I to IX), and members in the same 
group shared a highly conserved motif composition. A gene structure analysis 
suggested that most BjuVQ genes were intronless. A gene duplication analysis 
revealed that 254 pairs of BjuVQ genes were segmentally duplicated and one pair 
was tandemly duplicated. Expression profiles obtained from RNA-seq data 
demonstrated that most BjuVQ genes have different gene expression profiles in 
different organs, including leaf, stem, root, flower bud, pod, and seed. In 
addition, over half of the BjuVQ genes were differentially expressed at some 
time points under low temperature treatment. The qRT-PCR data revealed that 
BjuVQ23, BjuVQ55, BjuVQ57, BjuVQ67, BjuVQ100, and BjuVQ117 were upregulated in 
response to cold stress. Taken together, our study provides new insights into 
the roles of different BjuVQ genes in mustard and their possible roles in growth 
and development, as well as in response to cold stress."
1983,"Epinephelus cyanopodus is a coral reef-dwelling grouper with important economic 
and ecological value and is widely distributed in the western Pacific Ocean. The 
lack of genomic resources for E. cyanopodus hinders its adaptive evolution and 
phylogeny research. We constructed the first high-quality genome of E. 
cyanopodus based on DNBSEQ, PacBio, and Hic sequencing technologies, with a 
genome size of 998.82 Mb, contig N50 of 5.855 Mb, and scaffold N50 of 41.98 Mb. 
More than 99.7% of contigs were anchored to 24 pseudochromosomes, and 94.2% of 
BUSCO genes were found in the E. cyanopodus genome, indicating a high genome 
assembly completeness. A total of 26,337 protein-coding genes were predicted, of 
which 98.77% were functionally annotated. Phylogenetic analysis showed that E. 
cyanopodus separated from its closely related species Epinephelus akaara about 
11.5-26.5 million years ago, and the uplift of the Indo-Australian archipelago 
may have provided an opportunity for its rapid radiation. Moreover, several gene 
families associated with innate and adaptive immunity were significantly 
expanded in speckled blue grouper compared to other teleost genomes. 
Additionally, we identified several genes associated with immunity, growth and 
reproduction that are under positive selection in E. cyanopodus compared to 
other groupers, suggesting that E. cyanopodus has evolved broad adaptability in 
response to complex survival environment, which may provide the genetic basis 
for its rapid radiation. In brief, the high-quality reference genome of the 
speckled blue grouper provides a foundation for research on its biological 
traits and adaptive evolution and will be an important genetic tool to guide 
aquaculture and resolve its taxonomic controversies in future studies."
1984,"A previous study has reported that exposure to PM2.5 from diesel exhaust (diesel 
particulate matter (DPM)) for 21 days can deteriorate the cardiac recovery from 
myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (IR), where the latter is facilitated by 
the efficiency of mitochondrial subpopulations. Many investigators have 
demonstrated that IR impact on cardiac mitochondrial subpopulations is distinct. 
In the present study, we decipher the role of PM2.5 on IR associated 
mitochondrial dysfunction at the subpopulation level by administrating PM2.5 
directly to isolated female rat hearts via KH buffer. Our results demonstrated 
that PM2.5 administered heart (PM_C) severely deteriorated ETC enzyme activity 
(NQR, SQR, QCR, and COX) and ATP level in both IFM and SSM from the normal 
control. Comparatively, the declined activity was prominent in IFM fraction. 
Moreover, in the presence of IR (PM_IR), mitochondrial oxidative stress was 
higher in both subpopulations from the normal, where the IFM fraction of 
mitochondria experienced elevated oxidative stress than SSM. Furthermore, we 
assessed the in vitro protein translation capacity of IFM and SSM and found a 
declined ability in both subpopulations where the inability of IFM was 
significant in both PM_C and PM_IR groups. In support of these results, the 
expression of mitochondrial genes involved in fission, fusion, and mitophagy 
events along with the DNA maintenance genes such as GUF1, LRPPRC, and HSD17-b10 
were significantly altered from the control. Based on the above results, we 
conclude that PM2.5 administration to the heart inflicted mitochondrial damage 
especially to the IFM fraction, that not only deteriorated the cardiac 
physiology but also reduced its ability to resist IR injury."
1985,"Drought stress influences the vigor of plant seeds and inhibits seed 
germination, making it one of the primary environmental factors adversely 
affecting food security. The seed germination stage is critical to ensuring the 
growth and productivity of soybeans in soils prone to drought conditions. We 
here examined the genetic diversity and drought-tolerance phenotypes of 410 
accessions of a germplasm diversity panel for soybean and conducted quantitative 
genetics analyses to identify loci associated with drought tolerance of seed 
germination. We uncovered significant differences among the diverse genotypes 
for four growth indices and five drought-tolerance indices, which revealed 
abundant variation among genotypes, upon drought stress, and for genotype × 
treatment effects. We also used 158,327 SNP markers and performed GWAS for the 
drought-related traits. Our data met the conditions (PCA + K) for using a mixed 
linear model in TASSEL, and we thus identified 26 SNPs associated with drought 
tolerance indices for germination stage distributed across 10 chromosomes. Nine 
SNP sites, including, for example, Gm20_34956219 and Gm20_36902659, were 
associated with two or more phenotypic indices, and there were nine SNP markers 
located in or adjacent to (within 500 kb) previously reported drought tolerance 
QTLs. These SNPs led to our identification of 41 candidate genes related to 
drought tolerance in the germination stage. The results of our study contribute 
to a deeper understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying drought tolerance 
in soybeans at the germination stage, thereby providing a molecular basis for 
identifying useful soybean germplasm for breeding new drought-tolerant 
varieties."
1986,"The bioindication of oil and gas fields is a field of geomicrobiology that is 
mainly devoted to the detection of hydrocarbon-oxidizing microbial indicator 
species or functional genes in total DNA. However, it appears promising to use 
the physiological properties of microorganisms detection deposit type of 
hydrocarbons, in particular their ability to oxidize hydrocarbons under aerobic 
and anaerobic conditions. In this study, the most promising approach in this 
area was the method used for assessing the anaerobic degradation of 
hydrocarbons. When comparing molecular genetics and cultured methods of 
bioindication, it can be concluded that molecular biomarkers of functional genes 
for the anaerobic destruction of hydrocarbons (masD) make it possible to 
separate areas with traditional and gas-hydrate types of deposits. Using 
cultured methods, we found that representatives of the Nocardiaceae family of 
the phylum Actinomycetota were tied to the areas where gas hydrates were found. 
The ability of aerobic and facultative anaerobic hydrocarbon-oxidizing 
microorganisms to anaerobically utilize hydrocarbons was determined with 
cultured methods. For the first time, this ability was revealed for the genera 
Stenotrophomonas, Psychrobacter, Micrococcus and Peribacillus. The wide 
distribution of this ability that we found in strains isolated from both study 
regions suggests its prominent role in the destruction of hydrocarbons in marine 
sediments."
1987,"Pepper vein yellows virus 5 (PeVYV-5) belongs to a group of emerging 
poleroviruses (family Solemoviridae) which pose a risk to pepper cultivation 
worldwide. Since its first detection in Spain in 2013 and the determination of 
the complete genome sequence of an isolate in 2018, little is known on the 
presence, genomic variation and molecular properties of this pathogen. As other 
members of genus Polerovirus, PeVYV-5 encodes a P0 protein that was predicted to 
act as viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR), one of the major antiviral 
defense mechanisms in plants. The results of the present work have indicated 
that PeVYV-5 P0 is a potent VSR, which is able to induce the degradation of 
Argonaute (AGO) endonucleases, the main effectors of RNA silencing. New viral 
isolates have been identified in samples collected in 2020-2021 and sequencing 
of their P0 gene has revealed limited heterogeneity, suggesting that the protein 
is under negative selection. Analysis of natural and engineered P0 variants has 
pinpointed distinct protein motifs as critical for the VSR role. Moreover, a 
positive correlation between the VSR activity of the protein and its capability 
to promote AGO degradation could be established, supporting that such activity 
essentially relies on the clearance of core components of the RNA silencing 
machinery."
1988,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate 
gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. They are suggested to be 
involved in most biological processes of the cell primarily by targeting 
messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for cleavage or translational repression. Their binding 
to their target sites is mediated by the Argonaute (AGO) family of proteins. 
Thus, miRNA target prediction is pivotal for research and clinical applications. 
Moreover, transfer-RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) and other types of small RNAs 
have been found to be potent regulators of Ago-mediated gene expression. Their 
role in mRNA regulation is still to be fully elucidated, and advancements in the 
computational prediction of their targets are in their infancy. To shed light on 
these complex RNA-RNA interactions, the availability of good quality 
high-throughput data and reliable computational methods is of utmost importance. 
Even though the arsenal of computational approaches in the field has been 
enriched in the last decade, there is still a degree of discrepancy between the 
results they yield. This review offers an overview of the relevant advancements 
in the field of bioinformatics and machine learning and summarizes the key 
strategies utilized for small RNA target prediction. Furthermore, we report the 
recent development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, and explore the 
role of non-miRNA AGO driver sequences."
1989,"BACKGROUND: The vaginal microbiome is closely associated with the onset and 
recurrence of bacterial vaginosis (BV). In the present study, the state of 
vaginal microbiota during the onset and post-treatment asymptomatic stages of BV 
were compared to that of a healthy population to evaluate the changes in 
different characteristic bacteria during the onset, progression, and remission 
of BV.
METHODS: A case-control study was performed to explore these changes. Women with 
clinical symptoms of BV were divided into the disease group (M) and case-control 
group (C) based on the Nugent score. Subjects in the disease group whose 
symptoms were resolved after the treatment were assigned to the treated group 
(T) and healthy subjects were recruited into the normal control (N) group. The 
V3-V4 hypervariable regions of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were sequenced on the 
Illumina MiSeq platform.
RESULTS: The N harbored the highest number of detected species and a higher 
abundance of microbiota; they had a significantly higher abundance of 
Lactobacillus and different bacterial community composition compared to the 
other three groups. In group M, Gardnerella vaginalis was the dominant species, 
whereas Lactobacillus iners was predominant in the other three groups. While 
Lactobacillus was more commonly present in Group C compared to group M. it was 
significantly increased in group T. Alpha diversity analysis of bacterial 
communities revealed significant differences in community richness and diversity 
among all four groups (p &lt; 0.05). Significant differences in the distribution 
of various bacterial communities among the different groups were also observed 
(p &lt; 0.05). Specifically, the abundance of eight bacterial taxa (Megasphaera, 
Aerococcus christensenii, Clostridiales, Gardnerella, Peptostreptococcus, 
Veillonellaceae, Akkermansia, Coriobacteriales) differed significantly among the 
four groups (p &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Significant differences in the composition and alpha diversity of 
the vaginal microbiota at different stages of BV and the distribution of 
bacterial communities were observed among the investigated groups. In addition 
to Gardnerella, Sneathia sanguinegens and Prevotella timonensis play an 
important role in the pathogenesis of BV. The appearance of BV-like clinical 
symptoms was closely associated with the decrease in Prevotella and Atopobium 
vaginae populations."
1990,"Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon spp. are microsporidia with zoonotic 
potential that have been identified in humans, as well as in a large group of 
wild and domestic animals. Several wildlife species have been studied as 
reservoirs of zoonotic microsporidia in mainland Spain, including the European 
rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Due to a lack of data on microsporidia infection 
in wildlife on the Canary Islands, the aim of this work was to analyze the 
prevalence and identify the species of microsporidia in rabbits in Tenerife. 
Between 2015 and 2017, a total of 50 fecal samples were collected from rabbits 
in eight municipalities of Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Seven of the fifty 
samples (14%) were amplified using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
targeting the partial sequence of the 16S rRNA gene, the internal transcribed 
spacer (ITS) region, and the partial sequence of the 5.8S rRNA gene. Sanger 
sequencing reveals the presence of Encephalitozoon cuniculi genotype I in two 
samples (4%), and undescribed microsporidia species in five samples (10%). This 
study constitutes the first molecular detection and genotyping of E. cuniculi in 
rabbits in Spain."
1991,"Growth traits are influential factors that significantly affects the development 
of the sheep industry. A previous TMT proteomic analysis found that a key 
protein in the HIF signaling pathway, ARNT, may influence embryonic skeletal 
muscle growth and development in sheep. The purpose of this study was to better 
understand the association between the polymorphisms of ARNT and growth traits 
of sheep, and the potential function of ARNT. Real-time qPCR (qRT-PCR) of ARNT 
was carried out to compare its expression in different developmental stages of 
the muscle tissues and primary myoblasts in the Hu, Chinese merino, and Gangba 
sheep. The genetic variance of ARNT was detected using the Illumina Ovine SNP 50 
K and 600 K BeadChip in the Hu and Ujimqin sheep populations, respectively. The 
CDS sequence of the ARNT gene was cloned in the Hu sheep using PCR technology. 
Finally, bioinformatic analytical methods were applied to characterize the genes 
and their hypothetical protein products. The qRT-PCR results showed that the 
ARNT gene was expressed significantly in the Chinese merino embryo after 85 
gestation days (D85) (p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, after the sheep were born, the 
expression of ARNT was significant at the weaning stage of the Hu sheep (p &lt; 
0.01). However, there was no difference in the Gangba sheep.In addition, six SNP 
loci were screened using 50 K and 600 K BeadChip. We found a significant 
association between rs413597480 A &gt; G and the Hu sheep weight at weaning and 
backfat thickness in the 5-month-old sheep (p &lt; 0.05), and four SNP loci 
(rs162298018 G &gt; C, rs159644025 G &gt; A, rs421351865 G &gt; A, and 
rs401758103 A &gt; G) were also associated with growth traits in the Ujimqin 
sheep (p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, we found that a G &gt; C mutation at 1948 bp 
in the cloned ARNT CDS sequence of the Hu sheep was the same locus mutation as 
rs162298018 G &gt; C identified using the 600 K BeadChip, which resulted in a 
nonconservative missense point mutation, leading to a change from proline to 
alanine and altering the number of DNA, protein-binding sites, and the α-helix 
of the ARNT protein. There was a strong linkage disequilibrium between 
rs162298018 G &gt; C and rs159644025 G &gt; A, and the ARNT protein was 
conserved among the goat, Hu sheep, and Texel sheep. And, we propose that a 
putative molecular marker for growth and development in sheep may be the G &gt; 
C mutation at 1948 bp in the CDS region of the ARNT gene. Our study 
systematically analyzed the expression, structure, and function of the ARNT gene 
and its encoded proteins in sheep. This provides a basis for future studies of 
the regulatory mechanisms of the ARNT gene."
1992,"An increasing ecological phase shift from coral-dominated reefs to 
macroalgae-dominated reefs as a result of anthropogenic impacts, such as 
eutrophication, sedimentation, and overfishing, has been observed in many reef 
systems around the world. Ocean warming is a universal threat to both corals and 
macroalgae, which may alter the outcome of competition between them. Therefore, 
in order to explore the effects of indirect and direct exposure to macroalgae on 
the physiological, biochemical, and genetic expression of corals at elevated 
temperature, the coral Acropora hyacinthus and highly invasive green algae 
Caulerpa taxifolia were chosen. Physiologically, the results exhibited that, 
between the control and direct contact treatments, the density and chlorophyll a 
content of zooxanthella decreased by 53.1% and 71.2%, respectively, when the 
coral indirectly contacted with the algae at an ambient temperature (27 °C). 
Moreover, the enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) 
in coral tissue were enhanced by interacting with algae. After an increase of 3 
°C, the density and chlorophyll a content of the zooxanthella reduced by 84.4% 
and 93.8%, respectively, whereas the enzyme activities of SOD and CAT increased 
2.3- and 3.1-fold. However, only the zooxanthellae density and pigment content 
decreased when Caulerpa taxifolia was co-cultured with Acropora hyacinthus at 30 
°C. Molecularly, different from the control group, the differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) such as Rab family, ATG family, and Casp7 genes were significantly 
enriched in the endocytosis, autophagy, and apoptosis pathways, regardless of 
whether Acropora hyacinthus was directly or indirectly exposed to Caulerpa 
taxifolia at 27 °C. Under thermal stress without algae interaction, the DEGs 
were significantly enriched in the microbial immune signal transduction 
pathways, such as the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and TNF signaling 
pathway, while multiple cellular immunity (IFI47, TRAF family) and oxidative 
stress (CAT, SODC, HSP70) genes were upregulated. Inversely, compared with 
corals without interaction with algae at 30 °C, the DEGs of the corals that 
interacted with Caulerpa taxifolia at 30 °C were remarkably enriched in 
apoptosis and the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, including the 
transcription factors such as the Casp family and TRAF family. In conclusion, 
the density and chlorophyll a content of zooxanthella maintained a fading 
tendency induced by the macroalgae at ambient temperatures. The oxidative stress 
and immune response levels of the coral was elevated at 30 °C, but the 
macroalgae alleviated the negative effects triggered by thermal stress."
1993,"Rhizosphere microbiome is a dynamic and complex zone of microbial communities. 
This complex plant-associated microbial community, usually regarded as the 
plant's second genome, plays a crucial role in plant health. It is unquestioned 
that plant microbiome collectively contributes to plant growth and fitness. It 
also provides a safeguard from plant pathogens, and induces tolerance in the 
host against abiotic stressors. The revolution in omics, gene-editing and 
sequencing tools have somehow led to unravel the compositions and latent 
interactions between plants and microbes. Similarly, besides standard practices, 
many biotechnological, (bio)chemical and ecological methods have also been 
proposed. Such platforms have been solely dedicated to engineer the complex 
microbiome by untangling the potential barriers, and to achieve better 
agriculture output. Yet, several limitations, for example, the biological 
obstacles, abiotic constraints and molecular tools that capably impact plant 
microbiome engineering and functionality, remained unaddressed problems. In this 
review, we provide a holistic overview of plant microbiome composition, 
complexities, and major challenges in plant microbiome engineering. Then, we 
unearthed all inevitable abiotic factors that serve as bottlenecks by 
discouraging plant microbiome engineering and functionality. Lastly, by 
exploring the inherent role of micro/macrofauna, we propose economic and 
eco-friendly strategies that could be harnessed sustainably and 
biotechnologically for resilient plant microbiome engineering."
1994,"The genus Crassula is the second-largest genus in the family Crassulaceae, with 
about 200 species. As an acknowledged super-barcode, plastomes have been 
extensively utilized for plant evolutionary studies. Here, we first report 10 
new plastomes of Crassula. We further focused on the structural 
characterizations, codon usage, aversion patterns, and evolutionary rates of 
plastomes. The IR junction patterns-IRb had 110 bp expansion to rps19-were 
conservative among Crassula species. Interestingly, we found the codon usage 
patterns of matK gene in Crassula species are unique among Crassulaceae species 
with elevated ENC values. Furthermore, subgenus Crassula species have specific 
GC-biases in the matK gene. In addition, the codon aversion motifs from matK, 
pafI, and rpl22 contained phylogenetic implications within Crassula. The 
evolutionary rates analyses indicated all plastid genes of Crassulaceae were 
under the purifying selection. Among plastid genes, ycf1 and ycf2 were the most 
rapidly evolving genes, whereas psaC was the most conserved gene. Additionally, 
our phylogenetic analyses strongly supported that Crassula is sister to all 
other Crassulaceae species. Our findings will be useful for further evolutionary 
studies within the Crassula and Crassulaceae."
1995,"The success of the degradation of the extraembryonic serosal cuticle and the 
second embryonic cuticle (pro-nymphal cuticle) is essential for the development 
and molting of nymph from egg in Orthoptera Locusta migratoria. Chitinase 5 is 
an important gene for chitin degradation in nymphs and in the egg stage. In this 
study, we investigated the important roles of chitinase 5-1 (LmCht5-1) and 
chitinase 5-2 (LmCht5-2) in the degradation of the serosal and pro-nymphal 
cuticles during locust embryonic development. The serosal cuticle degrades from 
7-day-old embryos (E7) to E13, along with the degradation of the pro-nymphal 
cuticle, which begins at E12 to E14. The mRNA and protein of LmCht5-1 and 
LmCht5-2 are expressed during the degradation process of the serosal cuticle and 
the pro-nymphal cuticle. RNAi experiments at the embryonic stage show that both 
dsLmCht5-1 and dsLmCht5-2 contribute to the failure of development in early and 
late embryogenesis. Further, during the serosal cuticle molting process, 
ultra-structure analysis indicated that dsLmCht5-1 prevented the loss of the 
coarse chitin layer in the upper part in both early and late embryogenesis. 
Meanwhile, dsLmCht5-2 blocked the degradation of the lower fine chitin layer at 
the early stage and blocked the chitin degradation of loose coarse chitin in the 
late molting process. During the degradation of the pro-nymphal cuticle, 
dsLmCht5-1 suppresses chitin degradation between layers in the procuticle, while 
dsLmCht5-2 suppresses chitin degradation into filaments inside of the layer. In 
summary, our results suggest that both LmCht5-1 and LmCht5-2 contribute to the 
degradation of the serosal and pro-nymphal cuticles during the locust embryonic 
stage."
1996,"Due to the geographical, cultural and environmental variability in Xiangxi, 
China, distinctive indigenous cattle populations have formed. Among them, Loudi 
cattle and Xiangxi cattle are the local cattle in Hunan, and the environment in 
Loudi is relatively more enclosed and humid than that in Xiangxi. To study the 
genome and origin of Loudi cattle in hot and humid environments, 29 individuals 
were collected and sequenced by whole-genome resequencing. In addition, genomic 
data were obtained from public databases for 96 individuals representing 
different cattle breeds worldwide, including 23 Xiangxi cattle from western 
Hunan. Genetic analysis indicated that the genetic diversity of Loudi cattle was 
close to that of Chinese cattle and higher than that of other breeds. Population 
structure and ancestral origin analysis indicated the relationship between Loudi 
cattle and other breeds. Loudi has four distinctive seasons, with a stereoscopic 
climate and extremely rich water resources. Selective sweep analysis revealed 
candidate genes and pathways associated with environmental adaptation and 
homeostasis. Our findings provide a valuable source of information on the 
genetic diversity of Loudi cattle and ideas for population conservation and 
genome-associated breeding of local cattle in today's extreme climate 
environment."
1997,"Despite progress in biomedical technologies, cardiovascular disease remains the 
main cause of mortality. This is at least in part because current clinical 
interventions do not adequately take into account aging as a driver and are 
hence aimed at suboptimal targets. To achieve progress, consideration needs to 
be given to the role of cell aging in disease pathogenesis. We propose a model 
unifying the fundamental processes underlying most age-associated cardiovascular 
pathologies. According to this model, cell aging, leading to cell senescence, is 
responsible for tissue changes leading to age-related cardiovascular disease. 
This process, occurring due to telomerase inactivation and telomere attrition, 
affects all components of the cardiovascular system, including cardiomyocytes, 
vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, cardiac fibroblasts, and immune 
cells. The unified model offers insights into the relationship between upstream 
risk factors and downstream clinical outcomes and explains why interventions 
aimed at either of these components have limited success. Potential therapeutic 
approaches are considered based on this model. Because telomerase activity can 
prevent and reverse cell senescence, telomerase gene therapy is discussed as a 
promising intervention. Telomerase gene therapy and similar systems 
interventions based on the unified model are expected to be transformational in 
cardiovascular medicine."
1998,"Food security will be a substantial issue in the near future due to the 
expeditiously growing global population. The current trend in the agriculture 
industry entails the extravagant use of synthesized pesticides and fertilizers, 
making sustainability a difficult challenge. Land degradation, lower production, 
and vulnerability to both abiotic and biotic stresses are problems caused by the 
usage of these pesticides and fertilizers. The major goal of sustainable 
agriculture is to ameliorate productivity and reduce pests and disease 
prevalence to such a degree that prevents large-scale damage to crops. 
Agriculture is a composite interrelation among plants, microbes, and soil. Plant 
microbes play a major role in growth promotion and improve soil fertility as 
well. Bacillus spp. produces an extensive range of bio-chemicals that assist in 
plant disease control, promote plant development, and make them suitable for 
agricultural uses. Bacillus spp. support plant growth by N fixation, P and K 
solubilization, and phytohormone synthesis, in addition to being the most 
propitious biocontrol agent. Moreover, Bacilli excrete extracellular 
metabolites, including antibiotics, lytic enzymes, and siderophores, and 
demonstrate antagonistic activity against phytopathogens. Bacillus spp. boosts 
plant resistance toward pathogens by inducing systemic resistance (ISR). The 
most effective microbial insecticide against insects and pests in agriculture is 
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Additionally, the incorporation of toxin genes in 
genetically modified crops increases resistance to insects and pests. There is a 
constant increase in the identified Bacillus species as potential biocontrol 
agents. Moreover, they have been involved in the biosynthesis of metallic 
nanoparticles. The main objective of this review article is to display the uses 
and application of Bacillus specie as a promising biopesticide in sustainable 
agriculture. Bacillus spp. strains that are antagonistic and promote plant yield 
attributes could be valuable in developing novel formulations to lead the way 
toward sustainable agriculture."
1999,"OBJECTIVE: Hyperandrogenemia (HA) is the main pathophysiological change that 
takes place in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Cyproterone acetate (CYA) is a 
drug commonly used to reduce androgen in patients with PCOS. Long-term and 
continuous exposure to HA can cause ovarian granulosa cells (GCs), pyroptotic 
death, and follicular dysfunction in PCOS mice. The aim of this study was to 
investigate whether CYA could ameliorate the hyperandrogenemia-induced 
pyroptosis of PCOS ovarian GCs by alleviating the activation of the IRE1α 
signaling pathway.
METHODS: Firstly, thirty PCOS patients with HA as their main clinical 
manifestation were selected as the study group, and thirty non-PCOS patients 
were selected as the control group. The GCs and follicular fluid of the patients 
were collected, and the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins was detected. 
Secondly, a PCOS mouse model induced by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was 
constructed, and the treatment group model was constructed with the subcutaneous 
injection of cyproterone acetate in PCOS mice. The expression of 
pyroptosis-related protein in ovarian GCs was detected to explore the 
alleviating effect of CYA on the pyroptosis of ovarian GCs in PCOS mice. 
Thirdly, KGN cells-i.e., from the human GC line-were cultured with 
dihydrotestosterone, CYA, and ERN1 (IRE1α gene) small interfering RNA in vitro 
to explore whether CYA can alleviate the activation of the IRE1α signaling 
pathway and ameliorate the hyperandrogenemia-induced pyroptosis of PCOS ovarian 
GCs.
RESULTS: The expression of pyroptosis-related proteins was significantly 
increased in ovarian GCs of PCOS patients with HA as the main clinical 
manifestation, and in the PCOS mouse model induced by DHEA. After treatment with 
CYA, the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins in the ovarian GCs of mice 
was significantly lower than that in PCOS mice. In vitro experiments showed that 
CYA could ameliorate KGN cells' pyroptosis by alleviating the activation of the 
IRE1α signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that CYA could ameliorate the activation of the 
IRE1α signaling pathway in mouse GCs and KGN cells, and also alleviate 
pyroptosis in ovarian GCs. This study provides a new mechanism and evidential 
support for CYA in the treatment of PCOS patients."
2000,"The lack of precise molecular signatures limits the early diagnosis of non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study used gene expression data and 
interaction networks to develop a highly accurate model with the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for predicting NSCLC. The 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in NSCLC compared with 
normal tissues using TCGA and GTEx data. A biological network was constructed 
using DEGs, and the top 20 upregulated and 20 downregulated hub genes were 
identified. These hub genes were used to identify signature genes with penalized 
logistic regression using the LASSO to predict NSCLC. Our model's development 
involved the following steps: (i) the dataset was divided into 80% for training 
(TR) and 20% for testing (TD1); (ii) a LASSO logistic regression analysis was 
performed on the TR with 10-fold cross-validation and identified a combination 
of 17 genes as NSCLC predictors, which were used further for development of the 
LASSO model. The model's performance was assessed on the TD1 dataset and 
achieved an accuracy and an area under the curve of the receiver operating 
characteristics (AUC-ROC) of 0.986 and 0.998, respectively. Furthermore, the 
performance of the LASSO model was evaluated using three independent NSCLC test 
datasets (GSE18842, GSE27262, GSE19804) and achieved high accuracy, with an 
AUC-ROC of &gt;0.99, &gt;0.99, and 0.95, respectively. Based on this study, a 
web application called NSCLCpred was developed to predict NSCLC."
2001,"Current evidence suggests that the heart plays an important role in regulating 
systemic lipid homeostasis, and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity is a major 
cause of cardiovascular disease, although little is known about the specific 
mechanisms involved. Exercise training can reportedly improve abnormal lipid 
metabolism and cardiac dysfunction induced by high-fat diets; however, the 
molecular mechanisms are not yet understood. In the present study, to explore 
the relationship between exercise training and cardiac mtp in HFD flies and 
potential mechanisms by which exercise training affects HFD flies, Drosophila 
was selected as a model organism, and the GAL4/UAS system was used to 
specifically knock down the target gene. Experiments revealed that HFD-fed 
Drosophila exhibited changes in body weight, increased triglycerides (TG) and 
dysregulated cardiac contractility, consistent with observations in mammals. 
Interestingly, inhibition of cardiac mtp expression reduced HFD-induced cardiac 
damage and mitigated the increase in triglycerides. Further studies showed that 
in HFD +w1118, HFD + Hand &gt; w1118, and HFD+ Hand &gt; mtpRNAi, cardiac mtp 
expression downregulation induced by HFD was treated by exercise training and 
mitochondrial β-oxidation capacity in cardiomyocytes was reversed. Overall, 
knocking down mtp in the heart prevented an increase in systemic TG levels and 
protected cardiac contractility from damage caused by HFD, similar to the 
findings observed after exercise training. Moreover, exercise training 
upregulated the decrease in cardiac mtp expression induced by HFD. Increased 
Had1 and Acox3 expression were observed, consistent with changes in cardiac mtp 
expression."
2002,"For the long-term preservation of genetic resources, cryopreservation techniques 
have been developed for strawberry germplasm, mainly using in vitro-grown shoot 
tips. In this study, genetic stability was tested under greenhouse conditions 
for six strawberry accessions (IT232511, PHS0132, IT245810, IT245830, IT245852, 
and IT245860) derived from the following procedures: (1) conventional 
propagation (GH: greenhouse maintained); (2) in vitro propagation (TC: tissue 
culture); (3) pretreatment before cryopreservation (-LN: non-liquid nitrogen 
exposure); and (4) cryopreservation (+LN: liquid nitrogen exposure). To test the 
performance of phenotypic traits, we measured six vegetative and five fruit 
traits. There were no distinct differences in most of the characteristics, but a 
few traits, such as sugar content and pH of fruits in three accessions, showed 
higher values in +LN compared to GH. However, the differences disappeared in the 
first runner generation. To test genetic variations, a total of 102 bands were 
generated by twelve inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers. A few 
polymorphic bands were found only in plants derived from TC of IT245860, which 
was not cryopreserved. The sequencing analysis of four polymorphic bands 
produced by ISSR_15 showed that none of these sequences matched the 
characterized genes in NCBI. Phenotypic abnormality was not observed across all 
plants. This study indicates that cryopreserved plants of the six strawberry 
accessions are phenotypically and genetically stable. Therefore, the results of 
this study can help to implement cryobanking of strawberry germplasm."
2003,"Fish genetically selected for growth (GS) and reference (REF) fish were fed with 
CTRL (15% FM, 5-7% FO) or FUTURE (7.5% FM, 10% poultry meal, 2.2% poultry oil + 
2.5% DHA-algae oil) diets during a 12-months production cycle. Samples from 
initial (t0; November 2019), intermediate (t1; July 2020) and final (t2; 
November 2020) sampling points were used for Illumina 16S rRNA gene amplicon 
sequencing of the adherent microbiota of anterior intestine (AI). Samples from 
the same individuals (t1) were also used for the gene expression profiling of AI 
by RNA-seq, and subsequent correlation analyses with microbiota abundances. 
Discriminant analyses indicated the gut bacterial succession along the 
production cycle with the proliferation of some valuable taxa for facing 
seasonality and different developmental stages. An effect of genetic background 
was evidenced along time, decreasing through the progression of the trial, 
namely the gut microbiota of GS fish was less influenced by changes in diet 
composition. At the same time, these fish showed wider transcriptomic landmarks 
in the AI to cope with these changes. Our results highlighted an enhanced 
intestinal sphingolipid and phospholipid metabolism, epithelial turnover and 
intestinal motility in GS fish, which would favour their improved performance 
despite the lack of association with changes in gut microbiota composition. 
Furthermore, in GS fish, correlation analyses supported the involvement of 
different taxa with the down-regulated expression of pro-inflammatory markers 
and the boosting of markers of extracellular remodelling and response to 
bacterium. Altogether, these findings support the combined action of the gut 
microbiome and host transcriptionally mediated effects to preserve and improve 
gut health and function in a scenario of different growth performance and 
potentiality."
2004,"The molecular mechanisms underlying heat stress tolerance in animals to high 
temperatures remain unclear. This study identified the differentially expressed 
mRNA isoforms which narrowed down the most reliable DEG markers and molecular 
pathways that underlie the mechanisms of thermoregulation. This experiment was 
performed on Sprague Dawley rats housed at 22 °C (control group; CT), and three 
acute heat-stressed groups housed at 42 °C for 30 min (H30), 60 min (H60), and 
120 min (H120). Earlier, we demonstrated that acute heat stress increased the 
rectal temperature of rats, caused abnormal changes in the blood biochemical 
parameters, as well as induced dramatic changes in the expression levels of 
genes through epigenetics and post-transcriptional regulation. Transcriptomic 
analysis using RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data obtained previously from blood (CT 
and H120), liver (CT, H30, H60, and H120), and adrenal glands (CT, H30, H60, and 
H120) was performed. The differentially expressed mRNA isoforms (DEIs) were 
identified and annotated by the CLC Genomics Workbench. Biological process and 
metabolic pathway analyses were performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. A total of 225, 5764, and 
4988 DEIs in the blood, liver, and adrenal glands were observed. Furthermore, 
the number of novel differentially expressed transcript lengths with annotated 
genes and novel differentially expressed transcript with non-annotated genes 
were 136 and 8 in blood, 3549 and 120 in the liver, as well as 3078 and 220 in 
adrenal glands, respectively. About 35 genes were involved in the heat stress 
response, out of which, Dnaja1, LOC680121, Chordc1, AABR07011951.1, Hsp90aa1, 
Hspa1b, Cdkn1a, Hmox1, Bag3, and Dnaja4 were commonly identified in the liver 
and adrenal glands, suggesting that these genes may regulate heat stress 
response through interactions between the liver and adrenal glands. In 
conclusion, this study would enhance our understanding of the complex underlying 
mechanisms of acute heat stress, and the identified mRNA isoforms and genes can 
be used as potential candidates for thermotolerance selection in mammals."
2005,"The multi-domain GTPase (MnmE) is conservative from bacteria to human and 
participates in tRNA modified synthesis. However, our understanding of how the 
MnmE is involved in plant chloroplast development is scarce, let alone in rice. 
A novel rice mutant, thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient mutant 8 (tcd8) was 
identified in this study, which apparently presented an albino phenotype at 20 
°C but a normal green over 24 °C, coincided with chloroplast development and 
chlorophyll content. Map-based cloning and complementary test revealed the TCD8 
encoded a multi-domain GTPase localized in chloroplasts. In addition, the 
disturbance of TCD8 suppressed the transcripts of certain chloroplast-related 
genes at low temperature, although the genes were recoverable to nearly normal 
levels at high temperature (32 °C), indicating that TCD8 governs chloroplast 
development at low temperature. The multi-domain GTPase gene in rice is first 
reported in this study, which endorses the importance in exploring chloroplast 
development in rice."
2006,"Entomopathogenic fungi are promising biocontrol agents of insect-mediated crop 
damage. Microcycle conidiation has shown great potential in enhancing the 
conidial yield and quality of entomopathogenic fungi. Homologs of Cts1, an 
endochitinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, participate in cell separation in 
several fungal spp. and may contribute to the morphological differences that 
occur during the shift to microcycle conidiation. However, the precise functions 
of Cts1 in entomopathogenic fungi remain unclear. Herein, the endochitinase 
gene, MaCts1, was characterized in the model entomopathogen, Metarhizium 
acridum. A loss of function line for MaCts1 led to a delay of 1 h in the median 
germination time, a 28% reduction in conidial yield and significant defects in 
fungal resistances to UV-irradiation (18%) and heat-shock (15%), while fungal 
tolerances to cell wall stressors, oxidative and hyperosmotic stresses and 
virulence remained unchanged. The MaCts1-disruption strain displayed typical 
conidiation on the microcycle conidiation induction medium, SYA. In contrast, 
deletion of key genes in the morphogenesis-related NDR kinase network (MOR 
pathway)/regulation of Ace2 and morphogenesis (RAM pathway) did not affect the 
SYA-induction of microcycle conidiation. This indicates that MaCts1 makes 
contributions to the microcycle conidiation, which may not be dependent on the 
MOR/RAM pathway in M. acridum."
2007,"Bacillus subtilis is a model organism used to study molecular processes in 
prokaryotic cells. Sigma factor B, which associates with RNA polymerase, is one 
of the transcriptional regulators involved in the cell's response to 
environmental stress. This study addresses the key question of how the levels of 
free SigB, which acts as the actual regulator of gene expression, are 
controlled. A set of chemical equations describing the network controlling the 
levels of free SigB was designed, leading to a set of differential equations 
quantifying the dynamics of the network. Utilizing a microarray-measured gene 
expression time series then allowed the simulation of the kinetic behavior of 
the network in real conditions and investigation of the role of phosphatases 
RsbU/RsbP transmitting the environmental signal and controlling the amounts of 
free SigB. Moreover, the role of kinetic constants controlling the formation of 
the molecular complexes, which consequently influence the amount of free SigB, 
was investigated. The simulation showed that although the total amount of sigma 
B is relatively high in the unstressed population, the amount of free SigB, 
which actually controls its regulon, is quite low. The simulation also allowed 
determination of the proportion of all the network members that were free or 
bound in complexes. While previously the qualitative features of B. subtilis 
SigB have been studied in detail, the kinetics of the network have mostly been 
ignored. In summary, the computational results based on experimental data 
provide a quantitative insight into the functioning of the SigB-dependent 
circuit and provide a roadmap for its further exploration in this industrially 
important bacterium."
2008,"Pigments in cyclamen (Cyclamen purpurascens) endows flowers with great 
ornamental and medicinal values. However, little is known about the biosynthetic 
pathways of pigments, especially anthocyanins, in cyclamen flowers. Herein, 
anthocyanins profiling and RNA-Seq were used to decipher the molecular events 
using cyclamen genotypes of red (HXK) or white (BXK) flowers. We found that red 
cyclamen petals are rich in cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, 
delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, malvidin-3-O-glucoside, peonidin-3-O-rutinoside, 
quercetin-3-O-glucoside, and ruti. In addition, our transcriptomics data 
revealed 3589 up-regulated genes and 2788 down-regulated genes comparing the BXK 
to HXK. Our rich dataset also identified eight putative key genes for 
anthocyanin synthesis, including four chalcone synthase (CHS, g13809_i0, 
g12097_i0, g18851_i0, g36714_i0), one chalcone isomerase (CHI, g26337_i0), two 
flavonoid 3-hydroxylase (F3'H, g14710_i0 and g15005_i0), and one anthocyanidin 
synthase (ANS, g18981_i0). Importantly, we found a 2.5 order of magnitude higher 
expression of anthocyanin 3-O-glucosyltransferase (g8206_i0), which encodes a 
key gene in glycosylation of anthocyanins, in HXK compared to BXK. Taken 
together, our multiomics approach demonstrated massive changes in gene 
regulatory networks and anthocyanin metabolism in controlling cyclamen flower 
color."
2009,"Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) has a ZZ/ZW sex determination 
system, but the genotypic female (ZW) can be sex-reversed into phenotypic males, 
namely, pseudomales. Pseudomale fish can produce only Z-type sperm but not W 
sperm. However, the molecular mechanism is unclear. To screen the key genes 
involved in pseudomale sperm abnormalities, we analysed the transcriptomic 
profiles of pseudomale and male sperm. In comparison to male sperm, 592 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in pseudomale sperm, 
including 499 upregulated and 93 downregulated genes. KEGG analysis indicated 
that the FoxO signalling pathway, especially the foxo3a and foxo6-like genes, 
may play an important role in spermatogenesis. The DEGs were mainly distributed 
on sex chromosomes, with 158 downregulated genes on the Z chromosome and 41 
upregulated genes on the W chromosome. A specific area (14-15 M) on the Z 
chromosome was identified, which enriched eight DEGs inside the ~1 M region. In 
addition, there were five gene alleles on the sex chromosomes, which showed the 
opposite transcription pattern (upregulated for the W allele, downregulated for 
the Z allele). This study has provided valuable data for screening candidate 
genes involved in the pseudomale sperm abnormality."
2010,"Parvalbumins are small molecules with important functions in Ca2+ signaling, but 
their sequence comparisons to date, especially in fish, have been relatively 
poor. We here, characterize sequence motifs that distinguish parvalbumin 
subfamilies across vertebrate species, as well as those that distinguish 
individual parvalbumins (orthologues) in fish, and map them to known parvalbumin 
structures. As already observed by others, all classes of jawed vertebrates 
possess parvalbumins of both the α-parvalbumin and oncomodulin subfamilies. 
However, we could not find convincing phylogenetic support for the common habit 
of classifying all non-α-parvalbumins together as ""β-parvalbumins."" In teleost 
(modern bony) fish, we here distinguish parvalbumins 1-to-10, of which the gene 
copy number can differ between species. The genes for α-parvalbumins (pvalb6 and 
pvalb7) and oncomodulins (pvalb8 and pvalb9) are well conserved between teleost 
species, but considerable variation is observed in their copy numbers of the 
non-α/non-oncomodulin genes pvalb1-to-5 and pvalb10. Teleost parvalbumins 1-to-4 
are hardly distinguishable from each other and are highly expressed in muscle, 
and described allergens belong to this subfamily. However, in some fish species 
α-parvalbumin expression is also high in muscle. Pvalb5 and pvalb10 molecules 
form distinct lineages, the latter even predating the origin of teleosts, but 
have been lost in some teleost species. The present study aspires to be a frame 
of reference for future studies trying to compare different parvalbumins."
2011,"Long-term selection or evolution is an important factor governing the 
development of disease resistance in pigs. To better clarify the molecular 
mechanisms underlying different levels of disease resistance, we used 
transcriptomics and proteomics analysis to characterize differences in the 
immunities between six resistant (Min pig) and six susceptible (Large White, LW) 
pigs which were raised in the same environment. A total of 135 proteins and 791 
genes were identified as being differentially expressed between the Large White 
and Min pig groups. Protein expression clustering and functional analysis 
revealed that proteins related to immune system process, humoral immune 
response, the B cell receptor signaling pathway, lymphocyte-mediated immunity, 
and innate immune responses were more highly expressed in Min pigs. 
Transcriptome gene set enrichment analysis was used to reveal that pathways of 
cell adhesion molecules and antigen processing and presentation are 
significantly enriched in Min pigs. Integrated proteomics and transcriptomics 
data analysis identified 16 genes that are differentially expressed at both the 
mRNA and protein levels. In addition, 13 out of these 16 genes were related to 
the quantitative trait loci of immune diseases, including neural EGFL-like 2 
(NELL2) and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), which are involved in innate 
immunity. Correlation analysis between the genes/proteins and cytokines shows 
upregulated proteins in LW pigs in association with 
immunosuppressive/pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL) 10, IL6, 
and tumor necrosis factor alpha. This was further validated using parallel 
reaction monitoring analysis. In summary, we discovered several potential 
candidate pathways and key genes/proteins involved in determining differences in 
disease resistance between the two studied pig breeds, which could provide new 
insights into the breeding of pigs for disease resistance."
2012,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of death and 
morbidity; it may be accompanied by oxidative stress and inflammation with or 
without underlying genetic etiology. Finding circulating biomarkers for COPD 
that can help early diagnosis and predict exacerbation and association with 
respiratory functions has been challenging. There were 40 healthy participants 
and 60 COPD patients in this research. The rs2070600 gene variant was examined 
by PCR-RFLP. Circulating sRAGE and annexin A1 levels were determined by ELISA. 
GSH and MDA were determined by spectrophotometry. In COPD patients, sRAGE serum 
levels were substantially lower, but conversely, annexin A1 levels were much 
greater than in controls. The rs2070600 gene polymorphism's strong association 
with COPD was demonstrated by genotyping and allelic frequency distribution. The 
GA genotype was most distributed in COPD, and it was strongly linked to lower 
serum sRAGE levels. The interrelation between annexin A1, sRAGE, and COPD could 
be explained through effects on inflammatory mediators' pathways. The rs2070600 
gene polymorphism was found to significantly enhance the risk of COPD. Serum 
sRAGE and annexin A1 may be considered potential diagnostic tools for COPD. 
Through impacts on GSH and MDA levels that alter the release of inflammatory 
factors and, therefore, lung damage, it is possible to explain the relationship 
between annexin A1, sRAGE, and COPD."
2013,"A new strategy based on the combination of electrically conductive polymer 
nanocomposites and extracellular Zn2+ ions as a myogenic factor was developed to 
assess its ability to synergically stimulate myogenic cell response. The 
conductive nanocomposite was prepared with a polymeric matrix and a small amount 
of graphene (G) nanosheets (0.7% wt/wt) as conductive filler to produce an 
electrically conductive surface. The nanocomposites' surface electrical 
conductivity presented values in the range of human skeletal muscle tissue. The 
biological evaluation of the cell environment created by the combination of the 
conductive surface and extracellular Zn2+ ions showed no cytotoxicity and good 
cell adhesion (murine C2C12 myoblasts). Amazingly, the combined strategy, 
cell-material interface with conductive properties and Zn bioactive ions, was 
found to have a pronounced synergistic effect on myoblast proliferation and the 
early stages of differentiation. The ratio of differentiated myoblasts cultured 
on the conductive nanocomposites with extracellular Zn2+ ions added in the 
differentiation medium (serum-deprived medium) was enhanced by more than 170% 
over that of non-conductive surfaces (only the polymeric matrix), and more than 
120% over both conductive substrates (without extracellular Zn2+ ions) and 
non-conductive substrates with extracellular Zn2+. This synergistic effect was 
also found to increase myotube density, myotube area and diameter, and 
multinucleated myotube formation. MyoD-1 gene expression was also enhanced, 
indicating the positive effect in the early stages of myogenic differentiation. 
These results demonstrate the great potential of this combined strategy, which 
stands outs for its simplicity and robustness, for skeletal muscle tissue 
engineering applications."
2014,"A new cell line Japanese flounder spleen (JFSP) derived from the spleen of 
Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) was established and characterized in 
this study. The JFSP cells grew rapidly at 29 °C, and the optimum fetal bovine 
serum concentration in the L-15 medium was 15%. Cells were subcultured for more 
than 80 passages. The JFSP cells have a diploid chromosome number of 2n = 68, 
which differs from the chromosome number of normal diploid Japanese flounder. 
The established cells were susceptible to Bohle virus (BIV), Viral hemorrhagic 
septicemia virus (VHSV), Hirame rhabdovirus (HIRRV), Infectious hematopoietic 
necrosis virus (IHNV), and Lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV), as evidenced by 
varying degrees of cytopathic effects (CPE). Replication of the virus in JFSP 
cells was confirmed by qRT-PCR and transmission electron microscopy. In 
addition, the expression of four immune-related genes, TRAF3, IL-1β, TNF-α, and 
TLR2, was differentially altered following viral infection. The results 
indicated that the cells underwent an antiviral immune response. JFSP cell line 
is an ideal tool in vitro for virology. The use of fish cell lines to study the 
immune genes and immune mechanism of fish and to clarify the immune mechanism of 
fish has important theoretical significance and practical application value for 
the fundamental prevention and treatment of fish diseases."
2015,"Hereditary transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis is a severe, progressive, and 
heterogeneous multisystemic condition due to mutations in the TTR gene. Although 
multiple aspects of its molecular pathophysiological mechanisms have been 
elucidated over the years, it is possible to hypothesize different pathogenetic 
pathways. Indeed, we extensively investigated the serum levels of several 
molecules involved in the immune response, in a cohort of ATTRv patients and 
healthy controls (HCs). Sixteen ATTRv patients and twenty-five HCs were included 
in the study. IFN-alpha levels were higher in ATTRv patients than in HCs, as 
well as IFN-gamma levels. By contrast, IL-7 levels were lower in ATTRv patients 
than in HCs. No significant difference between groups was found regarding 
IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-33 levels. Correlation analysis did not reveal 
any significant correlation between IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-7, and demographic and 
clinical data. Larger and longitudinal studies using ultrasensitive methods to 
perform a full cytokine profiling are needed to better elucidate the role of 
inflammation in ATTRv pathogenesis and to test the reliability of these 
molecules as possible biomarkers in monitoring patients' progression."
2016,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a chronic neurodevelopmental psychotic disorder. The 
immune system and neuroinflammation seem to play a central role in the 
pathophysiology of SCZ. Clozapine is an effective atypical antipsychotic used 
for treatment-resistant SCZ. Life-threatening side effects, such as myocarditis, 
limit its use. We investigated the immunomodulatory effects of clozapine in an 
astroglial model of neuroinflammation. We thus assessed the effect of clozapine 
on the production of inflammatory mediators in human-derived astroglial (A172) 
cells, stimulated with a cytokine mix (TNFα, IL-1β, IFNγ). RT-PCR and ELISA 
analyses demonstrated that clozapine suppressed gene expression and production 
of TNFα, IL-1β and IL-8 and increased COX2 mRNA 24 h after stimulation. 
Clozapine inhibited Akt phosphorylation induced by the cytokine mix at 10 min 
and 40 min, as assessed by Western blot analysis with anti-pT308Akt antibody. 
Pretreatment with the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 increased COX2 gene expression in 
cytokine-stimulated cells, suggesting that Akt inhibition may be involved in 
COX2 gene expression upregulation. Clozapine may possess dual beneficial 
effects: inhibiting astroglial production of proinflammatory cytokines, thus 
attenuating neuroinflammation, and upregulating COX2 expression that may be 
relevant to improvement of neural functioning while accounting for some of its 
detrimental effects. Patients with TRS and neuroinflammatory markers may benefit 
particularly from clozapine treatment."
2017,"In GWAS studies, the neural adhesion molecule encoding the neuronal growth 
regulator 1 (NEGR1) gene has been consistently linked with both depression and 
obesity. Although the linkage between NEGR1 and depression is the strongest, 
evidence also suggests the involvement of NEGR1 in a wide spectrum of 
psychiatric conditions. Here we show the expression of NEGR1 both in tyrosine- 
and tryptophan hydroxylase-positive cells. Negr1-/- mice show a time-dependent 
increase in behavioral sensitization to amphetamine associated with increased 
dopamine release in both the dorsal and ventral striatum. Upregulation of 
transcripts encoding dopamine and serotonin transporters and higher levels of 
several monoamines and their metabolites was evident in distinct brain areas of 
Negr1-/- mice. Chronic (23 days) escitalopram-induced reduction of serotonin and 
dopamine turnover is enhanced in Negr1-/- mice, and escitalopram rescued reduced 
weight of hippocampi in Negr1-/- mice. The current study is the first to show 
alterations in the brain monoaminergic systems in Negr1-deficient mice, 
suggesting that monoaminergic neural circuits contribute to both depressive and 
obesity-related phenotypes linked to the human NEGR1 gene."
2018,"PICALM rs3851179, one of the genes most frequently linked to susceptibility of 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), plays a crucial role in regulating 
amyloid precursor protein, and amyloid β (Aβ) transcytosis. To explore the 
effects of PICALM and AD continuum stage on cortex thickness, CSF Aβ, and tau, 
188 cognitively normal controls, 261 MCI patients, and 140 early LOAD patients 
were recruited, and each group was divided into rs3851179 A-carriers and 
GG-carriers. A full factorial ANCOVA was used to analyze the main effects and 
interactive effects of AD continuum stage, and PICALM. The interactive effects 
of AD continuum stage and PICALM on cortex thickness and CSF biomarkers were not 
significant. The main effect of PICALM was significant on the left postcentral 
cortex thickness, and the cortex thickness of A-carriers was less than that of 
GG-carriers. The rs3851179 A-carriers displayed higher Aβ42 levels and Aβ42/40 
ratios, and lower P/T-tau ratios, compared with GG-carriers. A higher MMSE score 
was found in A-carriers among the LOAD patients. In conclusion, the main effects 
of PICALM were independent of AD continuum stage, and PICLAM rs3851179 genotypes 
may modulate left postcentral cortex thickness, Aβ42 level, and P/T-tau ratio. 
The rs3851179 A-allele may protect the cognitive function of LOAD patients."
2019,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key modulator of neuroplasticity 
and has an important role in determining the susceptibility to severe 
psychiatric disorder with a significant neurodevelopmental component such as 
major psychoses. Indeed, a potential association between BDNF serum levels and 
schizophrenia (SCZ) and schizoaffective disorder (SAD) has been tested in 
diverse studies and a considerable amount of them found reduced BDNF levels in 
these disorders. Here, we aimed at testing the association of BDNF serum levels 
with several demographic, clinical, and psychometric measures in 105 patients 
with SCZ and SAD, assessing the moderating effect of genetic variants within the 
BDNF gene. We also verified whether peripheral BDNF levels differed between 
patients with SCZ and SAD. Our findings revealed that BDNF serum levels are 
significantly lower in patients affected by SCZ and SAD presenting more severe 
depressive symptomatology. This finding awaits replication in future independent 
studies and points to BDNF as a possible prognostic indicator in major 
psychoses."
2020,"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are prevalent neurodevelopmental 
disorders. Genetics have been shown to have a role in the severity of alcohol's 
teratogenic effects on the developing brain. We previously identified 
recombinant inbred BXD mouse strains that show high (HCD) or low cell death 
(LCD) in the hippocampus following ethanol exposure. The present study aimed to 
identify gene networks that influence this susceptibility. On postnatal day 7 
(3rd-trimester-equivalent), male and female neonates were treated with ethanol 
(5.0 g/kg) or saline, and hippocampi were collected 7hrs later. Using the 
Affymetrix microarray platform, ethanol-induced gene expression changes were 
identified in all strains with divergent expression sets found between sexes. 
Genes, such as Bcl2l11, Jun, and Tgfb3, showed significant strain-by-treatment 
interactions and were involved in many apoptosis pathways. Comparison of HCD 
versus LCD showed twice as many ethanol-induced genes changes in the HCD. 
Interestingly, these changes were regulated in the same direction suggesting (1) 
more perturbed effects in HCD compared to LCD and (2) limited gene expression 
changes that confer resistance to ethanol-induced cell death in LCD. These 
results demonstrate that genetic background and sex are important factors that 
affect differential cell death pathways after alcohol exposure during 
development that could have long-term consequences."
2021,"INTRODUCTION: microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs playing a myriad 
of important roles in regulating gene expression. Of note, recent work 
demonstrated a critical role of miRNAs in the genesis and progression of brain 
arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). Accordingly, here we examine miRNA 
signatures related to bAVMs and associated gene expression. In so doing we 
expound on the potential prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic significance of 
miRNAs in the clinical management of bAVMs.
METHODS: A PRISMA-based literature review was performed using PubMed/Medline 
database with the following search terms: ""brain arteriovenous malformations"", 
""cerebral arteriovenous malformations"", ""microRNA"", and ""miRNA"". All preclinical 
and clinical studies written in English, regardless of date, were selected. For 
our bioinformatic analyses, miRWalk and miRTarBase machine learning algorithms 
were employed; the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was 
quired for associated pathways/functions.
RESULTS: four studies were ultimately included in the final analyses. Sequencing 
data consistently revealed the decreased expression of miR-18a in 
bAVM-endothelial cells, resulting in increased levels of vascular endodermal 
growth factor (VEGF), Id-1, matrix metalloproteinase, and growth signals. Our 
analyses also suggest that the downregulation of miR-137 and miR-195* within 
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) may foster the activation of inflammation, 
aberrant angiogenesis, and phenotypic switching. In the peripheral blood, the 
overexpression of miR-7-5p, miR-629-5p, miR-199a-5p, miR-200b-3p, and let-7b-5p 
may contribute to endothelial proliferation and nidus development. The machine 
learning algorithms employed confirmed associations between miRNA-related target 
networks, vascular rearrangement, and bAVM progression.
CONCLUSION: miRNAs expression appears to be critical in managing bAVMs' 
post-transcriptional signals. Targets of microRNAs regulate canonical vascular 
proliferation and reshaping. Although additional scientific evidence is needed, 
the identification of bAVM miRNA signatures may facilitate the development of 
novel prognostic/diagnostic tools and molecular therapies for bAVMs."
2022,"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists are a class of medications 
that act as antagonists of the CGRP receptor or ligand. They can be divided into 
monoclonal antibodies and non-peptide small molecules, also known as gepants. 
CGRP antagonists were the first oral agents specifically designed to prevent 
migraines. The second generation of gepants includes rimegepant (BHV-3000, 
BMS-927711), ubrogepant (MK-1602), and atogepant (AGN-241689, MK-8031). 
Zavegepant (BHV-3500, BMS-742413) belongs to the third generation of gepants 
characterized by different administration routes. The chemical and 
pharmacological properties of this new generation of gepants were calculated. 
The clinical trials showed that the new generation of CGRP antagonists is 
effective for the acute and/or preventive treatment of migraines. No increased 
mortality risks were observed to be associated with the second- and 
third-generation gepants. Moreover, the majority of the serious adverse events 
reported probably occurred unrelated to the medications. Interesting facts about 
gepants were highlighted, such as potency, hepatotoxicity, concomitant use with 
monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP, comparative analysis with triptans, 
and the ""acute and preventive"" treatment of migraine. Further studies should 
include an elderly population and compare the medications inside this class and 
with triptans. There are still concerns regarding the long-term side effects of 
these medications, such as chronic vascular hemodynamic impairment. Meanwhile, 
careful pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring should be performed in the 
clinical practice use of gepants."
2023,"(1) Background: Riboflavin transporter deficiency (RTD), formerly known as 
Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, is a rare condition that causes a progressive 
neurological syndrome in early life with features of auditory and optic 
neuropathy, weakness of bulbar muscles and the diaphragm and sensorimotor 
neuropathy. Pathologic mutations in the genes that code for riboflavin 
transporters have been identified as the genetic basis of RTD, and the majority 
of the genetically confirmed cases are caused by mutations of SLC52A3, a 
riboflavin transporter 2 coding gene or compound mutations in SLC52A2, encoding 
riboflavin transporter 3. Fatality in childhood is common if the condition is 
left untreated, but survival into adulthood has been reported in cases treated 
with high-dose oral riboflavin. (2) Case summary: We report two long-term 
survivors of RTD type 2 due to compound heterozygous 185T&gt; G and 1258G&gt;A 
mutations in gene SLC2A2. They are two brothers in a family in which two female 
siblings died in childhood from a similar neurological disorder. Brother one, 
the older RTD survivor, is aged 71, and brother two is aged 58. Both have 
significant visual impairment from optic nerve atrophy and sensory ataxia. Their 
muscle biopsies showed decreased muscle adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase 
activity. No AMPD1 mutation was detected through whole-genome sequencing. (3) 
Conclusion: Co-existing riboflavin transporter deficiency (RTD) type 2 and 
muscle AMP deaminase deficiency has not been previously reported. Apart from the 
possibility that there is a milder phenotype associated with these mutations in 
SLC2A2, AMP deaminase deficiency might have contributed to a survival benefit by 
preserving muscle function through accumulating intracellular AMP."
2024,"Pregnancy morbidity induced by anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL+/PM+) is mainly 
thought to arise from placental abnormalities. We attempted to investigate the 
effect of aPL on the activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in the trophoblast 
and how YAP regulated human trophoblasts function. Thus, HTR-8 cells were 
treated with IgG purified from aPL+/PM+ women or normal controls. We found that 
aPL+/PM+ IgG impacted YAP activity via abrogating YAP expression. Further 
investigation of the anti-β2GPI-IgG/β2GPI complex showed an inhibition of 
nuclear YAP level and translocation in a dose-dependent manner, which might be 
rescued by progesterone in HTR-8 cells. YAP overexpression or knockdown HTR-8 
cells were established for the evaluation of cell function and related gene 
expression in vitro. Loss of YAP arrested cell cycles in the G2/M phase, 
accelerated cell apoptosis by increasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl2, and disrupted 
MMP2/9-mediated cell migration and angiogenesis tube formation by VEGF. These 
findings support a new mechanism of PM associated with aPL through which YAP 
inactivation induced by aPL perturbs the trophoblast cell cycle, apoptosis, 
migration, and angiogenesis, finally developing into pregnancy failure."
2025,"An increasing amount of evidence points to an important role of macrophages in 
peripheral nerve injury (PNI) and associated pain. Peripheral nerve macrophages 
facilitate the regeneration, while dorsal root ganglia (DRG) macrophages might 
propagate the injury after a PNI. These differences might be explained by 
various in vivo models of PNIs or non-uniform methodologies to phenotype the 
macrophages. Unbiased methods to phenotype macrophages using single whole cell 
or nucleus transcriptomics have been rarely applied on PNIs outside the nerves 
themselves. Here, we compare the effects of the transection or crush of the 
sciatic nerve and spinal nerve transection on the DRG macrophage phenotypes 
utilizing a publicly available single-nucleus transcriptomic DRG dataset. Our 
results demonstrate that unique and time-dependent DRG macrophage gene 
expression profiles were produced by the three PNI models with particular 
macrophage clusters being enriched that were dependent on the severity of the 
neuronal injury score. PNI associated DRG macrophages were not purely anti- or 
pro-inflammatory. These results suggest that various functions of DRG macrophage 
subtypes are carefully orchestrated upon a PNI. These findings open a new avenue 
for studying the DRG macrophage subtypes in PNIs and encourage further unbiased 
phenotyping efforts to better understand their relevance in neuropathic pain."
2026,"Most children with developmental disabilities (DD) live in resource-limited 
countries (LMIC) or high-income country medical deserts (HICMD). A social 
contract between healthcare providers and families advocates for accurate 
diagnoses and effective interventions to treat diseases and toxic stressors. 
This bio-social model emphasizes reproductive health of women with 
trimester-specific maternal and pediatric healthcare interactions. Lifelong 
neuronal connectivity is more likely established across 80% of brain circuitries 
during the first 1000 days. Maladaptive gene-environment (G x E) interactions 
begin before conception later presenting as maternal-placental-fetal (MPF) 
triad, neonatal, or childhood neurologic disorders. Synergy between obstetrical 
and pediatric healthcare providers can reduce neurologic morbidities. 
Partnerships between healthcare providers and families should begin during the 
first 1000 days to address diseases more effectively to moderate maternal and 
childhood adverse effects. This bio-social model lowers the incidence and 
lessens the severity of sequalae such as DD. Access to genetic-metabolomic, 
neurophysiologic and neuroimaging evaluations enhances clinical decision-making 
for more effective interventions before full expression of neurologic 
dysfunction. Diagnostic accuracy facilitates developmental interventions for 
effective preschool planning. A description of a mother-child pair in a HIC 
emphasizes the time-sensitive importance for early interventions that influenced 
brain health throughout childhood. Partnership by her parents with healthcare 
providers and educators provided effective healthcare and lessened adverse 
effects. Effective educational interventions were later offered through her high 
school graduation. Healthcare disparities in LMIC and HICMD require that this 
bio-social model of care begin before the first 1000 days to effectively treat 
the most vulnerable women and children. Prioritizing family planning followed by 
prenatal, neonatal and child healthcare improves wellness and brain health. 
Familiarity with educational neuroscience for teachers applies neurologic 
diagnoses for effective individual educational plans. Integrating diversity and 
inclusion into medical and educational services cross socioeconomic, ethnic, 
racial, and cultural barriers with life-course benefits. Families require 
knowledge to recognize risks for their children and motivation to sustain 
relationships with providers and educators for optimal outcomes. The WHO 
sustainable development goals promote brain health before conception through the 
first 1000 days. Improved education, employment, and social engagement for all 
persons will have intergenerational and transgenerational benefits for 
communities and nations."
2027,"Multiple tumor exacerbations and treatment procedures, such as extracellular 
matrix remodeling, metabolic reprogramming, immunological evasion, and 
resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are influenced by intratumoral 
hypoxia. It is becoming increasingly clear how hypoxia interacts with the 
extracellular matrix and how this affects the growth of cancer. We analyzed the 
published sequencing results of hypoxia-stressed mouse kidney tumor cells and 
found that the expression of miR-29b was significantly downregulated. There are 
several sites that are complementary to the miR-29 seed sequence in the 3' 
non-coding regions (3'UTRs) of various extracellular matrix-related genes, 
including collagen IV. We analyzed the sequences of the 3'UTRs of different 
subunits of collagen IV in different species and constructed the corresponding 
phylogenetic trees. We found that the 3'UTRs of Col4a1 and Col4a4 may have been 
subjected to particular evolutionary pressures. By cloning the 3'UTRs of 
collagen IV subunits into the psiCHECKTM-2 vector, we found that seven of the 
eight sites in the Col4a3-Col4a6 gene complementary to miR-29 were significantly 
repressed by miR-29a, b (except for the 7774-7781 of Col4a3 gene). The 
inhibitory efficiency of miR-29a, b on these seven sites was between 27% and 
57%. The research on the regulation of miR-29 and extracellular matrix by 
hypoxia can provide a theoretical basis for tumor and fibrosis research and 
treatment."
2028,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) alters gut microbiota and tight junctions, causing 
bacterial components to enter the portal vein and induce oxidative 
stress-induced inflammation in the liver. Only corticosteroids and liver 
transplants are treatment options for severe alcoholic hepatitis. ALD's 
pathophysiology is unknown. However, acetaldehyde's toxic effects cause 
oxidative stress and intestinal permeability. This study investigates the 
influence of a synbiotic (a combination of aged garlic extract (AGE) and 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus MTCC1423) on colonic oxidative stress and inflammation 
in ALD male Wistar rats and Caco2 cells. MDA measurement by HPLC in CaCo2 cells, 
blood serum, and colon tissue demonstrated that synbiotic treatment in the ALD 
model reduces oxidative stress. Further, fecal high-throughput 16S rRNA gene 
sequencing revealed the microbiome's shift towards Firmicutes in the synbiotic 
group compared to ethanol. In addition, DCFDA labeling and H/E staining 
demonstrate that the synbiotic is beneficial in inhibiting the development of 
ALD. In the colon, the synbiotic reduces the activation of CYP2E1 and the 
inflammatory markers TNF-a and IL-6 while elevating the mRNA expression of ZO-1, 
occludin, and IL-10. Synbiotics colonize Lactobacillus to restore barrier 
function and microbiota and reduce colon oxidative stress. Thus, a synbiotic 
combination can be used in ALD treatment."
2029,"LINE L1 are transposable elements that can replicate within the genome by 
passing through RNA intermediates. The vast majority of these element copies in 
the human genome are inactive and just between 100 and 150 copies are still able 
to mobilize. During evolution, they could have been positively selected for 
beneficial cellular functions. Nonetheless, L1 deregulation can be detrimental 
to the cell, causing diseases such as cancer. The activity of miRNAs represents 
a fundamental mechanism for controlling transcript levels in somatic cells. 
These are a class of small non-coding RNAs that cause degradation or 
translational inhibition of their target transcripts. Beyond this, competitive 
endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), mostly made by circular and non-coding RNAs, have been 
seen to compete for the binding of the same set of miRNAs targeting protein 
coding genes. In this study, we have investigated whether autonomously 
transcribed L1s may act as ceRNAs by analyzing public dataset in-silico. We 
observed that genes sharing miRNA target sites with L1 have a tendency to be 
upregulated when L1 are overexpressed, suggesting the possibility that L1 might 
act as ceRNAs. This finding will help in the interpretation of transcriptomic 
responses in contexts characterized by the specific activation of transposons."
2030,"Inherited cancer predisposition genes are described as risk factors in head and 
neck cancer (HNC) families. To explore the clinical and epidemiological data and 
their association with a family history of cancer, we recruited 74 patients and 
164 relatives affected by cancer. The germline copy number alterations were 
evaluated in 18 patients using array comparative genomic hybridization. Two or 
more first-degree relatives with HNC, tobacco-associated tumor sites (lung, 
esophagus, and pancreas), or other related tumors (breast, colon, kidney, 
bladder, cervix, stomach carcinomas, and melanoma) were reported in 74 families. 
Ten index patients had no exposure to any known risk factors. Family members 
presented tumors of 19 topographies (30 head and neck, 26 breast, 21 colon). In 
first-degree relatives, siblings were frequently affected by cancer (n = 58, 13 
had HNC). Breast cancer (n = 21), HNC (n = 19), and uterine carcinoma (n = 15) 
were commonly found in first-degree relatives and HNC in second-degree relatives 
(n = 11). Nineteen germline genomic imbalances were detected in 13 patients; 
three presented gains of WRD genes. The number of HNC patients, the degree of 
kinship, and the tumor types detected in each relative support the role of 
heredity in these families. Germline alterations may potentially contribute to 
cancer development."
2031,"Alterations in the gut microbiome have been linked to obesity and type 2 
diabetes, in epidemiologic studies and studies of fecal transfer effects in 
germ-free mice. Here, we aimed to identify the effects of specific gut microbes 
on the phenotype of mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). After eight weeks of HFD 
feeding, male C57BL/6J mice in the HFD group ranking in the upper and lower 
quartiles for body weight gain were considered obese prone and obese resistant, 
respectively. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to determine the composition of 
the intestinal microbiota, and fecal transplantation (FMT) was conducted to 
determine whether the microbiota plays a causal role in phenotypic variation. 
Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013 was more abundant in the gut microbes of mice with a 
lean phenotype than in those with an obese phenotype. Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013 
was identified as the most significant biomarker for alleviating obesity by 
random forest analysis. In a correlation analysis of serum parameters and body 
weight, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013 was positively associated with serum HDL-C 
levels and negatively associated with serum TC, TG, and LDL-C levels. To 
conclude, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013 was identified as a novel microbiome biomarker 
for obesity resistance, which may serve as a basis for understanding the 
critical gut microbes responsible for obesity resistance. 
Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013 may serve as a target for microbiome-based diagnoses and 
treatments in the future."
2032,"Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized double-lipid-membrane-bound 
structures, acting mainly as signalling mediators between distant cells and, in 
particular, modulating the immune response and inflammation of targeted cells. 
Milk and colostrum contain high amounts of EVs that could be exploited as 
alternative natural systems in antimicrobial fighting. The aim of this study is 
to evaluate cow colostrum-derived EVs (colosEVs) for their antimicrobial, 
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects in vitro to assess their 
suitability as natural antimicrobial agents as a strategy to cope with the drug 
resistance problem. ColosEVs were evaluated on a model of neonatal calf 
diarrhoea caused by Escherichia coli infection, a livestock disease where 
antibiotic therapy often has poor results. Colostrum from Piedmontese cows was 
collected within 24 h of calving and colosEVs were immediately isolated. IPEC-J2 
cell line was pre-treated with colosEVs for 48 h and then infected with 
EPEC/NTEC field strains for 2 h. Bacterial adherence and IPEC-J2 gene expression 
analysis (RT-qPCR) of CXCL8, DEFB1, DEFB4A, TLR4, TLR5, NFKB1, MYD88, CGAS, RIGI 
and STING were evaluated. The colosEVs pre-treatment significantly reduced the 
ability of EPEC/NTEC strains to adhere to cell surfaces (p = 0.006), suggesting 
a role of ColosEVs in modulating host-pathogen interactions. Moreover, our 
results showed a significant decrease in TLR5 (p &lt; 0.05), CGAS (p &lt; 0.05) 
and STING (p &lt; 0.01) gene expression in cells that were pre-treated with 
ColosEVs and then infected, thus highlighting a potential antimicrobial activity 
of ColosEVs. This is the first preliminarily study investigating ColosEV 
immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects on an in vitro model of neonatal 
calf diarrhoea, showing its potential as a therapeutic and prophylactic tool."
2033,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and one of the leading causes of 
cancer mortality in males. Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective 
strategy to inhibit tumour growth at early stages. However, 10~50% of cases are 
estimated to progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
which currently lacks effective treatments. Clinically, salvage treatment 
measures, such as endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, are mostly used for 
advanced prostate cancer, but their clinical outcomes are not ideal. When the 
existing clinical therapeutic methods can no longer inhibit the development of 
advanced prostate cancer, human adenovirus (HAdV)-based gene therapy and viral 
therapy present promising effects. Pre-clinical studies have shown its powerful 
oncolytic effect, and clinical studies are ongoing to further verify its effect 
and safety in prostate cancer treatment. Targeting the prostate by HAdV alone or 
in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy sheds light on patients with 
castration-resistant and advanced prostate cancer. This review summarizes the 
advantages of oncolytic virus-mediated cancer therapy, strategies of HAdV 
modification, and existing preclinical and clinical investigations of 
HAdV-mediated gene therapy to further evaluate the potential of oncolytic 
adenovirus in prostate cancer treatment."
2034,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (nCRT) represents the standard of 
care for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC); however, there exists no 
biomarker that can predict the cancer's response to treatment as less than 20% 
of patients experience pathological complete response (pCR). Ionizing radiations 
induce double strand breaks (DSBs) and trigger a DNA damage response (DDR) 
involving ATM, ATR, and the MRN complex (MRE11, Rad50, and NBS1). In this study, 
we performed an extensive mutational analysis of the genes involved in the DDR 
pathway in LARC patients who have undergone nCRT.
METHODS: 13 LARC patients with pCR and 11 LARC patients with partial response 
(pPR) were investigated using a NGS dedicated panel, designed for formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, containing ATR, ATM, and MRE11-RAD50-NBN 
genes. The identified variants were classified according to guidelines' 
recommendations.
RESULTS: Eight non-benign variants, six of which were observed in 3 (23%) out of 
13 pCR patients, were identified. In particular, a pCR patient carried out a 
pathogenetic frameshift mutation in exon 21 of the RAD50 gene. The two remaining 
non-benign missense variants were found in 2 (18%) out of 11 patients in the pPR 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the genes involved in the Homologous 
Recombination (HR) pathway are rarely mutated in LARC; however, given the 
identification of a missense mutation in RAD 50 in one case of pCR, it could be 
worth exploring its potential role as a biomarker in larger series."
2035,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) refers to a cluster of metabolic dysregulations, which 
include insulin resistance, obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia and hypertension. 
The complex pathogenesis of MetS encompasses the interplay between environmental 
and genetic factors. Environmental factors such as excessive nutrients and 
sedentary lifestyle are modifiable and could be improved by lifestyle 
modification. However, genetic susceptibility to MetS, a non-modifiable factor, 
has attracted the attention of researchers, which could act as the basis for 
future diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy for MetS. Several cholesterol-related 
genes associated with each characteristic of MetS have been identified, such as 
apolipoprotein, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), cholesteryl ester transfer protein 
(CETP) and adiponectin. This review aims to summarize the genetic information of 
cholesterol-related genes in MetS, which may potentially serve as biomarkers for 
early prevention and management of MetS."
2036,"Antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism (AIP) is the most common type of 
extrapyramidal side effect (EPS), caused by the blockage of dopamine receptors. 
Since dopamine availability might influence the AIP risk, the dopamine 
transporter (DAT) and serotonin receptors (5-HTRs), which modulate the dopamine 
release, may be also involved in the AIP development. As some of the individual 
differences in the susceptibility to AIP might be due to the genetic background, 
this study aimed to examine the associations of SLC6A3, HTR2C and HTR6 gene 
polymorphisms with AIP in haloperidol-treated schizophrenia patients. The 
Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) was used to evaluate AIP as a 
separate entity. Genotyping was performed using a PCR, following the extraction 
of blood DNA. The results revealed significant associations between HTR6 
rs1805054 polymorphism and haloperidol-induced tremor and rigidity. 
Additionally, the findings indicated a combined effect of HTR6 T and SLC6A3 9R 
alleles on AIP, with their combination associated with significantly lower 
scores of ESRS subscale II for parkinsonism, ESRS-based tremor or hyperkinesia 
and ESRS subscales VI and VIII. These genetic predictors of AIP could be helpful 
in better understanding its pathophysiology, recognizing the individuals at risk 
of developing AIP and offering personalized therapeutic strategies for the 
patients suffering from this EPS."
2037,"(1) Background: T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) is a potential 
immunotherapeutic target in a variety of malignant entities, and antibody-based 
treatments are currently under investigation in clinical trials. While promising 
results were observed in patients with lung cancer, the role of TIGIT in oral 
squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) as a biomarker as well as a therapeutic target 
remains elusive. Therefore, we evaluated the role of TIGIT as a prognostic 
factor in OSCC. (2) Methods: Here, we describe the results of a retrospective 
tissue microarray (TMA) OSCC cohort. Using immunohistochemistry, TIGIT 
expression was correlated with overall and recurrence-free survival (OAS and 
RFS, respectively). Additionally, in silico analysis was performed based on the 
TCGA Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) cohort in order to correlate 
patients' survival with TIGIT and CD274 (encoding for PD-L1) gene expression 
levels. (3) Results: Database analysis revealed a beneficial outcome in OAS for 
tumor patients with high intraepithelial CD3-TIGIT-expression (n = 327). Hereby, 
OAS was 53.9 months vs. 30.1 months for patients with lower TIGIT gene 
expression levels (p = 0.033). In our retrospective OSCC-TMA cohort, elevated 
TIGIT levels on CD3+ cells correlated significantly with improved OAS (p = 
0.025) as well as distant RFS (p = 0.026). (4) Conclusions: This study 
introduces TIGIT as a novel prognostic factor in OSCC, indicating the improved 
outcome of OSCC patients relative to their increased TIGIT expression. TIGIT 
might provide therapeutic implications for future immunotherapy in 
advanced-stage OSCC patients."
2038,"Kupffer cells are maintained via self-renewal in specific microenvironmental 
niches, primarily the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). In this study, 
we propagated tissue-resident macrophages (Mø) from mouse liver using mixed 
culture with hepatic fibroblastic cells. Propagated liver Mø express Id3, Lxra 
and Spic transcription factors, which are required for Kupffer cell 
characterization. Thus, Kupffer cell properties are likely to be maintained in 
liver Mø propagated using mixed culture with fibroblastic cells. We revealed (i) 
gene expression of certain Eph receptors and ephrin ligands including EphA2, 
ephrin-A1, EphB4, and ephrin-B1 in propagated liver Mø and primary LSECs, (ii) 
immunohistochemical localization of these Eph/ephrin member molecules indicating 
common expression in Kupffer cells and LSECs, and (iii) surface expression of 
several integrin α and β subunits, including α4β1, αLβ2, αMβ2, and αXβ2 integrin 
in propagated liver Mø and that of the corresponding ligands ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 
in primary LSECs. Moreover, EphA/ephrin-A and EphB/ephrin-B interactions 
promoted liver Mø adhesion to the ICAM-1-adsorbed surface, which mimicked that 
of LSECs and may be implicated in the residence of Kupffer cells in the liver 
sinusoid. Further studies on regulating the residence and regeneration of 
Kupffer cells in related hepatic disorders are required to validate our 
findings."
2039,"People with Down syndrome (PWDS) are more at risk for developing obesity, 
oxidative stress disorders, metabolic disorders, and lipid and carbohydrate 
profile disorders than the general population. The presence of an additional 
copy of genes on chromosome 21 (i.e., the superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1) and 
gene coding for the cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) enzyme) raises the risk for 
cardiovascular disease (CVD). As a result of disorders in metabolic processes 
and biochemical pathways, theoretically protective factors (low homocysteine 
level, high SOD1 level) do not fulfil their original functions. Overexpression 
of the CBS gene leads to the accumulation of homocysteine-a CVD risk factor. An 
excessive amount of protective SOD1, in the case of a lack of compensatory 
increase in the activity of catalase and peroxidase, leads to intensifying free 
radical processes. The occurrence of metabolic disorders and the amplified 
effect of oxidative stress carries higher risk of exposure of people with DS to 
CVD. At present, classic predispositions are known, but it is necessary to 
identify early risk factors in order to be able to employ CVD and obesity 
prophylaxis. Detailed determination of the metabolic and lipid profile may 
provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying CVD."
2040,"Genetic regulation of vascular patterning is not fully understood. Here, we 
report a novel gene, gtpbp1l (GTP-binding protein 1-like), that regulates 
vascular development in zebrafish. Amino acid sequence comparison and a 
phylogenetic study showed that gtpbp1l is conserved in vertebrates. Gtpbp1l mRNA 
is expressed in the vasculature during embryogenesis. Knockdown of gtpbp1l by 
morpholino impairs the patterning of the intersegmental vessel (ISV) and caudal 
vein plexus (CVP), indicating the role of gtpbp1l in vasculature. Further 
apoptosis assays and transgenic fish tests suggested that vascular defects in 
gtpbp1l morphants are not due to cell death but are likely caused by the 
impairment of migration and proliferation. Moreover, the altered expression of 
vessel markers is consistent with the vascular defects in gtpbp1l morphants. 
Finally, we revealed that gtpbp1l is regulated by VEGF/notch and BMP signaling. 
Collectively, these findings showed that gtpbp1l plays a critical role in 
vascular patterning during zebrafish development."
2041,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. 
Hereditary CRC syndromes account for approximately 5-10% of all CRC, with a 
lifetime risk of CRC that approaches 50-80% in the absence of endoscopic or 
surgical treatment. Hereditary CRC syndromes can be phenotypically divided into 
polyposis and non-polyposis syndrome, mainly according to the conditions of 
polyps. The typical representatives are familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and 
Lynch syndromes (LS), respectively. Over the past few decades, molecular 
genetics enhanced the discovery of cancer-predisposing genes and revolutionized 
the field of clinical oncology. Hereditary CRC syndromes have been a key part of 
this effort, with data showing that pathogenic variants are present in up to 10% 
of cases. Molecular phenotypes of tumors can not only help identify individuals 
with genetic susceptibility to CRC but also guide the precision prevention and 
treatment for the development of CRC. This review emphasizes the molecular basis 
and prevention strategies for hereditary CRC syndromes."
2042,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor exhibiting rapid and infiltrative 
growth, with less than 10% of patients surviving over 5 years, despite 
aggressive and multimodal treatments. The poor prognosis and the lack of 
effective pharmacological treatments are imputable to a remarkable histological 
and molecular heterogeneity of GBM, which has led, to date, to the failure of 
precision oncology and targeted therapies. Identification of molecular 
biomarkers is a paradigm for comprehensive and tailored treatments; 
nevertheless, biopsy sampling has proved to be invasive and limited. 
Radiogenomics is an emerging translational field of research aiming to study the 
correlation between radiographic signature and underlying gene expression. 
Although a research field still under development, not yet incorporated into 
routine clinical practice, it promises to be a useful non-invasive tool for 
future personalized/adaptive neuro-oncology. This review provides an up-to-date 
summary of the recent advancements in the use of magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) radiogenomics for the assessment of molecular markers of interest in GBM 
regarding prognosis and response to treatments, for monitoring recurrence, also 
providing insights into the potential efficacy of such an approach for survival 
prognostication. Despite a high sensitivity and specificity in almost all 
studies, accuracy, reproducibility and clinical value of radiomic features are 
the Achilles heel of this newborn tool. Looking into the future, investigators' 
efforts should be directed towards standardization and a disciplined approach to 
data collection, algorithms, and statistical analysis."
2043,"Density-dependent regulation of cell growth is presumed to be caused by 
cell-cell contact, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not yet clearly 
defined. Here, we report that receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase-kappa 
(R-PTP-κ) is an important regulator of cell contact-dependent growth inhibition. 
R-PTP-κ expression increased in proportion to cell density. siRNA-mediated 
R-PTP-κ downregulation led to the loss of cell contact-mediated growth 
inhibition, whereas its upregulation reduced anchorage-independent cell growth 
in soft agar as well as tumor growth in nude mice. Expression profiling and 
luciferase reporter system-mediated signaling pathway analysis revealed that 
R-PTP-κ induced under cell contact conditions distinctly suppressed E2F 
activity. Among the structural domains of R-PTP-κ, the cytoplasmic domain 
containing the tandemly repeated PTP motif acts as a potent downregulator of the 
E2F pathway. Specifically, R-PTP-κ suppressed CDK2 activity through the 
induction of p21Cip1/WAF-1 and p27Kip1, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G1 
phase. In transcriptome-based public datasets generated from four different 
tumor types, R-PTP-κ expression was negatively correlated with the expression 
pattern and prognostic value of two known E2F1 target genes (CCNE1 and CDC25A). 
Therefore, our results indicate that the R-PTP-κ-E2F axis plays a crucial role 
in cell growth-inhibitory signaling arising from cell-cell contact conditions."
2044,"Heme is a member of the porphyrins family of cyclic tetrapyrroles and influences 
various cell processes and signalling pathways. Enzyme deficiencies in the heme 
biosynthetic pathway provoke rare human inherited metabolic diseases called 
porphyrias. Protein levels and activity of enzymes involved in the heme 
biosynthetic pathway and especially 5'-Aminolevulinate Synthase 1 are featured 
by 24-h rhythmic oscillations driven by the biological clock. Heme biosynthesis 
and circadian pathways intermingle with mutual modulatory roles. Notably, heme 
is a ligand of important cogs of the molecular clockwork, which upon heme 
binding recruit co-repressors and inhibit the transcription of numerous genes 
enriching metabolic pathways and encoding functional proteins bringing on 
crucial cell processes. Herein, we assessed mRNA levels of circadian genes in 
patients suffering from porphyrias and found several modifications of core clock 
genes and clock-controlled genes expression, associated with metabolic and 
electrolytic changes. Overall, our results show an altered expression of 
circadian genes accompanying heme biosynthesis disorders and confirm the need to 
deepen the knowledge of the mechanisms through which the alteration of the 
circadian clock circuitry could take part in determining signs and symptoms of 
porphyria patients and then again could represent a target for innovative 
therapeutic strategies."
2045,"The clinical pathology of Taxol-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN), 
characterized by loss of sensory sensitivity and pain, is mirrored in a 
preclinical pharmacological mice model in which Gabapentin, produced 
anti-thermal hyperalgesia and anti-allodynia effects. The study aimed to 
investigate the hypothesis that gabapentin may protect against Taxol-induced 
neuropathic pain in association with an effect on intra-epidermal nerve fibers 
density in the TIPN mice model. A TIPN study schedule was induced in mice by 
daily injection of Taxol during the first week of the experiment. Gabapentin 
therapy was performed during the 2nd and 3rd weeks. The neuropathic pain was 
evaluated during the whole experiment by the Von Frey, tail flick, and hot plate 
tests. Intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) density in skin biopsies was measured 
at the end of the experiment by immunohistochemistry of ubiquitin 
carboxyl-terminal hydrolase PGP9.5 pan-neuronal and calcitonin gene-related 
(CGRP) peptides-I/II- peptidergic markers. Taxol-induced neuropathy was 
expressed by 80% and 73% reduction in the paw density of IENFs and CGPR, and 
gabapentin treatment corrected by 83% and 46% this reduction, respectively. 
Gabapentin-induced increase in the IENF and CGRP nerve fibers density, thus 
proposing these evaluations as an additional objective end-point tool in TIPN 
model studies using gabapentin as a reference compound."
2046,"Axons in the peripheral nervous system have the ability to repair themselves 
after damage, whereas axons in the central nervous system are unable to do so. A 
common and important characteristic of damage to the spinal cord, brain, and 
peripheral nerves is the disruption of axonal regrowth. Interestingly, intrinsic 
growth factors play a significant role in the axonal regeneration of injured 
nerves. Various factors such as proteomic profile, microtubule stability, 
ribosomal location, and signalling pathways mark a line between the central and 
peripheral axons' capacity for self-renewal. Unfortunately, glial scar 
development, myelin-associated inhibitor molecules, lack of neurotrophic 
factors, and inflammatory reactions are among the factors that restrict axonal 
regeneration. Molecular pathways such as cAMP, MAPK, JAK/STAT, ATF3/CREB, 
BMP/SMAD, AKT/mTORC1/p70S6K, PI3K/AKT, GSK-3β/CLASP, BDNF/Trk, Ras/ERK, 
integrin/FAK, RhoA/ROCK/LIMK, and POSTN/integrin are activated after nerve 
injury and are considered significant players in axonal regeneration. In 
addition to the aforementioned pathways, growth factors, microRNAs, and 
astrocytes are also commendable participants in regeneration. In this review, we 
discuss the detailed mechanism of each pathway along with key players that can 
be potentially valuable targets to help achieve quick axonal healing. We also 
identify the prospective targets that could help close knowledge gaps in the 
molecular pathways underlying regeneration and shed light on the creation of 
more powerful strategies to encourage axonal regeneration after nervous system 
injury."
2047,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterized by alterations in 
processes that regulate both synaptic plasticity and functional connectivity 
between brain regions. Antipsychotics are the cornerstone of schizophrenia 
pharmacological treatment and, beyond occupying dopamine D2 receptors, can 
affect multiple molecular targets, pre- and postsynaptic sites, as well as 
intracellular effectors. Multiple lines of evidence point to the involvement of 
antipsychotics in sculpting synaptic architecture and remodeling the neuronal 
functional unit. Furthermore, there is an increasing awareness that 
antipsychotics with different receptor profiles could yield different 
interregional patterns of co-activation. In the present systematic review, we 
explored the fundamental changes that occur under antipsychotics' 
administration, the molecular underpinning, and the consequences in both acute 
and chronic paradigms. In addition, we investigated the relationship between 
synaptic plasticity and functional connectivity and systematized evidence on 
different topographical patterns of activation induced by typical and atypical 
antipsychotics."
2048,"A migraine is a neurological condition that can cause multiple symptoms. It is 
up to three times more common in women than men, thus, estrogen may play an 
important role in the appearance attacks. Its exact pathomechanism is still 
unknown; however, the activation and sensitization of the trigeminal system play 
an essential role. We aimed to use an animal model, which would better 
illustrate the process of repeated episodic migraine attacks to reveal possible 
new mechanisms of trigeminal pain chronification. Twenty male (M) and forty 
ovariectomized (OVX) female adult rats were used for our experiment. Male rats 
were divided into two groups (M + SIF, M + IS), while female rats were divided 
into four groups (OVX + SIF, OVX + IS, OVX + E2 + SIF, OVX + E2 + IS); half of 
the female rats received capsules filled with cholesterol (OVX + SIF, OVX + IS), 
while the other half received a 1:1 mixture of cholesterol and 17β-estradiol 
(OVX + E2 + SIF, OVX + E2 + IS). The animals received synthetic interstitial 
fluid (SIF) (M + SIF, OVX + SIF, OVX + E2 + SIF) or inflammatory soup (IS) (M + 
IS, OVX + IS, OVX + E2 + IS) treatment on the dural surface through a cannula 
for three consecutive days each week (12 times in total). Behavior tests and 
immunostainings were performed. After IS application, a significant decrease was 
observed in the pain threshold in the M + IS (0.001 &lt; p &lt; 0.5), OVX + IS 
(0.01 &lt; p &lt; 0.05), and OVX + E2 + IS (0.001 &lt; p &lt; 0.05) groups 
compared to the control groups (M + SIF; OVX + SIF, OVX + E2 + SIF). The 
locomotor activity of the rats was lower in the IS treated groups (M + IS, 0.01 
&lt; p &lt; 0.05; OVX + IS, p &lt; 0.05; OVX + E2 + IS, 0.001 &lt; p &lt; 0.05), 
and these animals spent more time in the dark room (M + IS, p &lt; 0.05; OVX + 
IS, 0.01 &lt; p &lt; 0.05; OVX + E2 + IS, 0.001 &lt; p &lt; 0.01). We found a 
significant difference between M + IS and OVX + E2 + IS groups (p &lt; 0.05) in 
the behavior tests. Furthermore, IS increased the area covered by calcitonin 
gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactive (IR) fibers (M + IS, p &lt; 0.01; OVX 
+ IS, p &lt; 0.01; OVX + E2 + IS, p &lt; 0.001) and the number of neuronal 
nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) IR cells (M + IS, 0.001&lt; p &lt; 0.05; OVX + IS, 
0.01 &lt; p &lt; 0.05; OVX + E2 + IS, 0.001 &lt; p &lt; 0.05) in the caudal 
trigeminal nucleus (TNC). There was no difference between M + IS and OVX + IS 
groups; however, the area was covered by CGRP IR fibers (0.01 &lt; p &lt; 0.05) 
and the number of nNOS IR cells was significantly higher in the OVX + E2 + IS (p 
&lt; 0.05) group than the other two IS- (M + IS, OVX + IS) treated animals. 
Overall, repeated administration of IS triggers activation and sensitization 
processes and develops nociceptive behavior changes. CGRP and nNOS levels 
increased significantly in the TNC after IS treatments, and moreover, pain 
thresholds and locomotor activity decreased with the development of photophobia. 
In our model, stable high estradiol levels proved to be pronociceptive. Thus, 
repeated trigeminal activation causes marked behavioral changes, which is more 
prominent in rats treated with estradiol, also reflected by the expression of 
the sensitization markers of the trigeminal system."
2049,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex psychiatric disorder of multifactorial origin, 
in which both genetic and environmental factors have an impact on its onset, 
course, and outcome. Large variability in response and tolerability of 
medication among individuals makes it difficult to predict the efficacy of a 
chosen therapeutic method and create universal and precise guidelines for 
treatment. Pharmacogenetic research allows for the identification of genetic 
polymorphisms associated with response to a chosen antipsychotic, thus allowing 
for a more effective and personal approach to treatment. This review focuses on 
three frequently prescribed second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), 
risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole, and aims to analyze the current state 
and future perspectives in research dedicated to identifying genetic factors 
associated with antipsychotic response. Multiple alleles of genes involved in 
pharmacokinetics (particularly isoenzymes of cytochrome P450), as well as 
variants of genes involved in dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate 
neurotransmission, have already been identified as ones of significant impact on 
antipsychotic response. It must, however, be noted that although currently 
obtained results are promising, trials with bigger study groups and unified 
protocols are crucial for standardizing methods and determining objective 
antipsychotic response status."
2050,"BACKGROUND: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are approved for 
patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer harboring 
deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA1 and/or 2 mutations. Identifying 
patients with prostate cancer harboring these mutations may be challenging. 
Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) provides an avenue for an easier detection of 
these mutations. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the concordance of BRCA mutations 
in the tumor tissue and cfDNA in patients with metastatic prostate cancer in the 
real-world setting.
METHODS: Somatic genomic profiling results were obtained from a clinical cohort 
of patients at our institution who had at least two samples tested. One of the 
samples needed to be from either primary or metastatic tissue. Concordance was 
adjusted to not include mutation types that the cfDNA platforms were not 
designed to detect.
RESULTS: The presence or absence of mutations in the BRCA gene was assessed in a 
total of 589 samples, including 327 cfDNA samples, from 260 patients with 
metastatic prostate cancer. The median time between the first test and any 
subsequent test was 22.8 (0.0-232) months. BRCA mutation was present in the 
patient's original prostate tissue in 23 samples (3.9%) of patients. The 
adjusted concordance between prostate tumor tissue and cfDNA was 97.9% [95% CI, 
95.3-99.1%]. The adjusted concordance between metastatic samples and cfDNA was 
93.5% [95% CI, 86.4-97.3%]. Of the patients who had a BRCA mutation detected in 
their prostate tissue, there was a 70% probability of detecting a BRCA mutation 
in the patient's cfDNA as well. For patients who did not have a detectable BRCA 
mutation in their primary prostate tissue, the probability of detecting a 
subsequent one later in the disease course was less than 0.9%.
CONCLUSION: There is a high level of concordance between tissue and blood for 
BRCA mutations. Testing cfDNA can provide reliable information on BRCA 
mutational status and is a viable alternative to solid tissue sequencing when 
unavailable. The development of a new BRCA mutation later in the disease course 
is a rare event."
2051,"BACKGROUND: A critical unmet medical need in clinical management of colorectal 
cancer (CRC) pivots around lack of noninvasive and or minimally invasive 
techniques for early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of clinical outcomes. 
Because DNA methylation can capture the regulatory landscape of tumors and can 
be measured in body fluids, it provides unparalleled opportunities for the 
discovery of early diagnostic and prognostics markers predictive of clinical 
outcomes. Here we investigated use of DNA methylation for the discovery of 
potential clinically actionable diagnostic and prognostic markers for predicting 
survival in CRC.
METHODS: We analyzed DNA methylation patterns between tumor and control samples 
to discover signatures of CpG sites and genes associated with CRC and predictive 
of survival. We conducted functional analysis to identify molecular networks and 
signaling pathways driving clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We discovered a signature of aberrantly methylated genes associated 
with CRC and a signature of thirteen (13) CpG sites predictive of survival. We 
discovered molecular networks and signaling pathways enriched for CpG sites 
likely to drive clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The investigation revealed that CpG sites can predict survival in 
CRC and that DNA methylation can capture the regulatory state of tumors through 
aberrantly methylated molecular networks and signaling pathways."
2052,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterial pathogen of global concern and is 
responsible for 10-15% of nosocomial infections worldwide. This opportunistic 
bacterial pathogen is known to cause serious complications in immunocompromised 
patients and is notably the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients 
suffering from cystic fibrosis. Currently, the only line of defense against P. 
aeruginosa infections is antibiotic treatment. Due to the acquired and adaptive 
resistance mechanisms of this pathogen, the prevalence of multidrug resistant P. 
aeruginosa strains has increased, presenting a major problem in healthcare 
settings. To date, there are no approved licensed vaccines to protect against P. 
aeruginosa infections, prompting the urgent need alternative treatment options. 
An alternative to traditional vaccines is vectored immunoprophylaxis (VIP), 
which utilizes a safe and effective adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy 
vector to produce sustained levels of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
in vivo from a single intramuscular injection. In this review, we will provide 
an overview of P. aeruginosa biology and key mechanisms of pathogenesis, discuss 
current and emerging treatment strategies for P. aeruginosa infections and 
highlight AAV-VIP as a promising novel therapeutic platform."
2053,"Major progress has been made over the last decade in identifying novel genes 
involved in neurodevelopmental disorders, although the task of elucidating their 
corresponding molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms, which are an 
essential prerequisite for developing therapies, has fallen far behind. We 
selected 45 genes for intellectual disabilities to generate and characterize 
mouse models. Thirty-nine of them were based on the frequency of pathogenic 
variants in patients and literature reports, with several corresponding to de 
novo variants, and six other candidate genes. We used an extensive screen 
covering the development and adult stages, focusing specifically on behaviour 
and cognition to assess a wide range of functions and their pathologies, ranging 
from basic neurological reflexes to cognitive abilities. A heatmap of behaviour 
phenotypes was established, together with the results of selected mutants. 
Overall, three main classes of mutant lines were identified based on activity 
phenotypes, with which other motor or cognitive deficits were associated. These 
data showed the heterogeneity of phenotypes between mutation types, 
recapitulating several human features, and emphasizing the importance of such 
systematic approaches for both deciphering genetic etiological causes of ID and 
autism spectrum disorders, and for building appropriate therapeutic strategies."
2054,"BACKGROUND: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an enzyme responsible 
for producing an active form of folate. The MTHFR T677T genotype may have 
adverse health effects associated with weight gain and a reduction in folate 
availability.
AIM: In this study, we examined the influence of the MTHFR C677T variant on BMI 
and determined its role as a risk factor for obesity. We also assessed the 
relationships between the MTHFR C677T genotype and folate and vitamin B12 
concentrations in subjects before and after radical weight loss.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 1712 Caucasian adults of Polish 
nationality with a wide range of body mass indexes (BMIs). DNA was extracted 
from the blood, and the C677T variant was tested with RFLP-PCR and 
real-time-PCR.
RESULTS: There was no significant influence found for the MTHFR 677 TT genotype 
on BMI or the obesity risk in codominant, dominant or recessive inheritance 
models. Individuals with obesity and the TT genotype had significantly lower 
folate concentrations. After radical weight reduction, the impact of the risk 
genotype, as well as homeostasis between folate and vitamin B12 in TT 
homozygotes, seems to be attenuated.
CONCLUSION: Although the MTHFR 677TT genotype is not directly related to a 
higher BMI in Polish adults, it has a detrimental effect on folate 
concentrations in individuals with high BMI values."
2055,"We previously established mouse models of biliary tract cancer (BTC) based on 
the injection of cells with biliary epithelial stem cell properties derived from 
KRAS(G12V)-expressing organoids into syngeneic mice. The resulting mouse tumors 
appeared to recapitulate the pathological features of human BTC. Here we 
analyzed images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for both the mouse tumor 
tissue and human cholangiocarcinoma tissue by pixel-level clustering with 
machine learning. A pixel-clustering model that was established via training 
with mouse images revealed homologies of tissue structure between the mouse and 
human tumors, suggesting similarities in tumor characteristics independent of 
animal species. Analysis of the human cholangiocarcinoma tissue samples with the 
model also revealed that the entropy distribution of cancer regions was higher 
than that of noncancer regions, with the entropy of pixels thus allowing 
discrimination between these two types of regions. Histograms of entropy tended 
to be broader for noncancer regions of late-stage human cholangiocarcinoma. 
These analyses indicate that our mouse BTC models are appropriate for 
investigation of BTC carcinogenesis and may support the development of new 
therapeutic strategies. In addition, our pixel-level clustering model is highly 
versatile and may contribute to the development of a new BTC diagnostic tool."
2056,"Diabetes is known to delay wound healing, and this delay is attributed to 
prolonged inflammation. We found that microRNAs (miRNAs) might be involved in 
the dysfunction of diabetic-derived neutrophils, and dynamics of neutrophil and 
chronic inflammation might be initiated by miRNA-regulated genes. Moreover, 
studies of miRNA function in nephropathy have suggested that circular RNAs 
(circRNAs), which function as sponges of miRNA to regulate their expression, are 
potential biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for the diagnosis of diabetic 
nephropathy. Accordingly, to investigate the molecular mechanism of the 
regulation of inflammation in diabetic-derived neutrophils, we identified 
circRNAs in diabetic-derived neutrophils obtained from BKS.Cg-Dock7m +/+ 
Leprdb/J (Leprdb/db and Leprdb/+) mice using microarrays. Neutrophils from 
pooled bone marrow of three diabetic and three non-diabetic mice were isolated 
and total RNA was extracted. Microarray analysis was performed using the 
Arraystar Mouse Circular RNA Array. The results showed that three circRNAs were 
significantly increased and six circRNAs were significantly decreased in 
diabetic-derived neutrophils compared with non-diabetic-derived neutrophils. The 
expressions of some circRNAs in diabetic-derived neutrophils were more than 
double those in non-diabetic-derived neutrophils. The circRNAs contain binding 
sites of miRNAs, which were differentially expressed in diabetic-derived 
neutrophils. Our results suggest that circRNAs may be involved in the regulation 
of inflammation in diabetic-derived neutrophils."
2057,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central 
nervous system (CNS), which leads to disturbances in the conduction of nerve 
impulses, cognitive impairment, sensory and motor disturbances, as well as 
depressive symptoms. MS remains an incurable disease with a difficult diagnosis 
and unclear etiology. The aim of the analysis was to identify SNPs that may 
potentially be associated with an increased risk of developing MS. Blood samples 
were obtained from patients with MS (194 subjects) and age-matched healthy 
controls (188 subjects). The polymorphic variant frequencies of rs197412 T&gt;C 
in GEMIN3, rs7813 G&gt;A in GEMIN4, rs1106042 G&gt;A in HIWI, rs10719 A&gt;C in 
DROSHA, rs3742330 A&gt;G in DICER1, rs11077 T&gt;G in XPO5, rs14035 C&gt;T in 
RAN, rs636832 G&gt;A in AGO1 were determined in DNA using real-time PCR TaqMan® 
SNP Genotyping Assay. Our findings indicate that the GG AGO1 rs636832 and AA 
GEMIN4 rs7813 genotypes were associated with an increased risk of MS. Although 
our findings provide a clearer understanding of the pathogenesis of MS, further 
investigations are needed to better understand their potential for the 
evaluation of other miRNA processing genes believed to be associated with MS 
etiology."
2058,"The use of a new bioinformatics pipeline allowed the identification of 
deregulated transcription factors (TFs) coexpressed in lung cancer that could 
become biomarkers of tumor establishment and progression. A gene regulatory 
network (GRN) of lung cancer was created with the normalized gene expression 
levels of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the microarray dataset 
GSE19804. Moreover, coregulatory and transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) 
analyses were performed for the main regulators identified in the GRN analysis. 
The gene targets and binding motifs of all potentially implicated regulators 
were identified in the TRN and with multiple alignments of the TFs' target gene 
sequences. Six transcription factors (E2F3, FHL2, ETS1, KAT6B, TWIST1, and 
RUNX2) were identified in the GRN as essential regulators of gene expression in 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and related to the lung tumoral process. Our 
findings indicate that RUNX2 could be an important regulator of the lung cancer 
GRN through the formation of coregulatory complexes with other TFs related to 
the establishment and progression of lung cancer. Therefore, RUNX2 could become 
an essential biomarker for developing diagnostic tools and specific treatments 
against tumoral diseases in the lung after the experimental validation of its 
regulatory function."
2059,"A decrease in serotonergic transmission throughout the brain is among the 
earliest pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Serotonergic 
receptors are also affected in AD. Polymorphisms in genes of serotonin (5HT) 
receptors have been mostly associated with behavioral and psychological symptoms 
of dementia (BPSD). In this study, we examined if AD patients carrying different 
genotypes in 5HTR1B rs13212041, 5HTR2A rs6313 (T102C), 5HTR2C rs3813929 
(-759C/T), and 5HTR6 rs1805054 (C267T) polymorphisms have a higher risk of 
faster disease progression (assessed by neuropsychological testing), are more 
prone to develop AD-related pathology (reflected by levels of cerebrospinal 
fluid [CSF] AD biomarkers), or have an association with an apolipoprotein E 
(APOE) haplotype. This study included 115 patients with AD, 53 patients with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 2701 healthy controls. AD biomarkers were 
determined in the CSF of AD and MCI patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays (ELISA), while polymorphisms were determined using either TaqMan SNP 
Genotyping Assays or Illumina genotyping platforms. We detected a significant 
decrease in the CSF amyloid β1-42 (Aβ1-42) and an increase in p-tau181/Aβ1-42 
ratio in carriers of the T allele in the 5HTR2C rs3813929 (-759C/T) 
polymorphism. A significantly higher number of APOE ε4 allele carriers was 
observed among individuals carrying a TT genotype within the 5HTR2A T102C 
polymorphism, a C allele within the 5HTR1B rs13212041 polymorphism, and a T 
allele within the 5HTR6 rs1805054 (C267T) polymorphism. Additionally, 
individuals carrying the C allele within the 5HTR1B rs13212041 polymorphism were 
significantly more represented among AD patients and had poorer performances on 
the Rey-Osterrieth test. Carriers of the T allele within the 5HTR6 rs1805054 had 
poorer performances on the MMSE and ADAS-Cog. As all four analyzed polymorphisms 
of serotonin receptor genes showed an association with either genetic, CSF, or 
neuropsychological biomarkers of AD, they deserve further investigation as 
potential early genetic biomarkers of AD."
2060,"Humans and other organisms are continuously exposed to thousands of chemicals 
through the atmosphere, drinking water, food, or direct contact. A large 
proportion of such chemicals are present in very low concentrations and may have 
synergistic effects, even at their no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL). 
Complex mixtures of contaminants are very difficult to assess by traditional 
toxicological methods. There is increasing attention on how different pollutants 
induce adverse physiological functions in the human body through effects on the 
circadian rhythm. However, it is very difficult to screen for compounds with 
circadian-rhythm-disrupting effects from a large number of chemicals or their 
complex mixtures. We established a stable firefly luciferase reporter gene 
knock-in U2-OS cell line by CRISPR/Cas9 to screen circadian-rhythm-disrupting 
pollutants. The luciferase gene was inserted downstream of the core clock gene 
BMAL1 and controlled by an endogenous promoter. Compared to detection systems 
using exogenous promoters, these cells enable the detection of compounds that 
interfere with the circadian rhythm system mediated by BMAL1 gene expression. 
The U2-OS knock-in cells showed BMAL1 and luciferase activity had parallel 
changes when treated with BMAL1 inhibitor and activator. Furthermore, the 
luciferase reporter gene has high sensitivity and is faster and more 
cost-effective than classic toxicology methods. The knock-in cell line can be 
used for high-throughput and efficient screening of circadian-rhythm-disrupting 
chemicals such as drugs and pollutants."
2061,"The aggregation and interaction of metabolic risk factors leads to highly 
heterogeneous pathogeneses, manifestations, and outcomes, hindering risk 
stratification and targeted management. To deconstruct the heterogeneity, we 
used baseline data from phase II of the Fangshan Family-Based Ischemic Stroke 
Study (FISSIC), and a total of 4632 participants were included. A total of 732 
individuals who did not have any component of metabolic syndrome (MetS) were set 
as a reference group, while 3900 individuals with metabolic abnormalities were 
clustered into subtypes using multi-trait limited mixed regression (MFMR). Four 
metabolic subtypes were identified with the dominant characteristics of 
abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. Multivariate 
logistic regression showed that the hyperglycemia-dominant subtype had the 
highest coronary heart disease (CHD) risk (OR: 6.440, 95% CI: 3.177-13.977) and 
that the dyslipidemia-dominant subtype had the highest stroke risk (OR: 2.450, 
95% CI: 1.250-5.265). Exome-wide association studies (EWASs) identified eight 
SNPs related to the dyslipidemia-dominant subtype with genome-wide significance, 
which were located in the genes APOA5, BUD13, ZNF259, and WNT4. Functional 
analysis revealed an enrichment of top genes in metabolism-related biological 
pathways and expression in the heart, brain, arteries, and kidneys. Our findings 
provide directions for future attempts at risk stratification and evidence-based 
management in populations with metabolic abnormalities from a systematic 
perspective."
2062,"The estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) is physiologically essential for reproductive 
biology and is implicated in various diseases. However, despite more than 20 
years of intensive research on ERβ, there are still uncertainties about its 
distribution in tissues and cellular expression. Several studies show contrasts 
between mRNA and protein levels, and the use of knockout strategies revealed 
that many commercially available antibodies gave false-positive expression 
results. Recently, a specific monoclonal antibody against human ERβ (PPZ0506) 
showed cross-reactivity with rodents and was optimized for the detection of rat 
ERβ. Herein, we established an immunohistochemical detection protocol for ERβ 
protein in mouse tissue. Staining was optimized on murine ovaries, as granulosa 
cells are known to strongly express ERβ. The staining results were confirmed by 
western blot analysis and RT-PCR. To obtain accurate and reliable staining 
results, different staining conditions were tested in paraffin-embedded tissues. 
Different pitfalls were encountered in immunohistochemical detection. Strong 
heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) and appropriate antibody dilution were 
required to visualize specific nuclear expression of ERβ. Finally, the 
specificity of the antibody was confirmed by using ovaries from Esr2-depleted 
mice. However, in some animals, strong (non-specific) background staining 
appeared. These signals could not be significantly alleviated with commercially 
available additional blocking solutions and are most likely due to 
estrus-dependent expression of endogenous immunoglobulins. In summary, our study 
showed that the antibody PPZ0506, originally directed against human ERβ, is also 
suitable for reliable detection of murine ERβ. An established staining protocol 
mitigated ambiguities regarding the expression and distribution of ERβ in 
different tissues and will contribute to an improved understanding of its role 
and functions in murine tissues in the future."
2063,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies induce durable responses in 
approximately 15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who exhibit microsatellite 
instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR). However, more than 
80% of CRC patients do not respond to current immunotherapy. The main challenge 
with these patients is lack of MHC-I signaling to unmask their cancer cells so 
the immune cells can detect them. Here, we started by comparing IFNγ signature 
genes and MHC-I correlated gene lists to determine the potential candidates for 
MHC-I regulators. Then, the protein expression level of listed potential 
candidates in normal and cancer tissue was compared to select final candidates 
with enough disparity between the two types of tissues. ISG15 and DDX60 were 
further tested by wet-lab experiments. Overexpression of DDX60 upregulated the 
expression of MHC-I, while knockdown of DDX60 reduced the MHC-I expression in 
CRC cells. Moreover, DDX60 was downregulated in CRC tissues, and lower levels of 
DDX60 were associated with a poor prognosis. Our data showed that DDX60 could 
regulate MHC-I expression in CRC; thus, targeting DDX60 may improve the effects 
of immunotherapy in some patients."
2064,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by severe hypoxemia 
and high-permeability pulmonary edema. A hallmark of the disease is the presence 
of lung inflammation with features of diffuse alveolar damage. The molecular 
pathogenetic mechanisms of COVID-19-associated ARDS (CARDS), secondary to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, are still not fully understood. Here, we investigate the 
effects of a cytokine-enriched conditioned medium from Spike S1-activated 
macrophage on alveolar epithelial A549 cells in terms of cell proliferation, 
induction of autophagy, and expression of genes related to protein degradation. 
The protective effect of baricitinib, employed as an inhibitor of JAK-STAT, has 
been also tested. The results obtained indicate that A549 exhibits profound 
changes in cell morphology associated to a proliferative arrest in the G0/G1 
phase. Other alterations occur, such as a blockade of protein synthesis and the 
activation of autophagy, along with an increase of the intracellular amino acids 
content, which is likely ascribable to the activation of protein degradation. 
These changes correlate to the induction of IFN-regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) due 
to an increased secretion of IFN-γ in the conditioned medium from S1-activated 
macrophages. The addition of baricitinib prevents the observed effects. In 
conclusion, our findings suggest that the IFN-γ-IRF-1 signaling pathway may play 
a role in the alveolar epithelial damage observed in COVID-19-related ARDS."
2065,"The chromosomal region 17p13.3 contains extensive repetitive sequences and is a 
well-recognized region of genomic instability. The 17p13.3 microduplication 
syndrome has been associated with a clinical spectrum of moderately non-specific 
phenotypes, including global developmental delay/intellectual disability, 
behavioral disorders, autism spectrum disorder and variable dysmorphic features. 
Depending on the genes involved in the microduplication, it can be categorized 
in two subtypes with different phenotypes. Here, we report a case of a 
7-year-old boy with global developmental delay, speech impairment, hypotonia, 
behavioral conditions (ADHD and ODD), non-specific dysmorphic features and 
overgrowth. Genetic testing revealed a small 17p13.3 chromosomal duplication, 
which included the BHLHA9, CRK and YWHAE genes. Additionally, we observed that 
this was maternally inherited, and that the mother presented with a milder 
phenotype including mild learning disabilities, speech impairment and 
non-specific dysmorphic features, which did not significantly affect her. In 
conclusion, we present a clinical case of a 17p13.3 duplication that further 
delineates the clinical spectrum of this syndrome, including its 
intrafamilial/intergenerational variability."
2066,"Heart failure constitutes a clinical complex syndrome with different symptomatic 
characteristics depending on age, sex, race and ethnicity, among others, which 
has become a major public health issue with an increasing prevalence. One of the 
most interesting tools seeking to improve prevention, diagnosis, treatment and 
prognosis of this pathology has focused on finding new molecular biomarkers 
since heart failure relies on deficient cardiac homeostasis, which is regulated 
by a strict gene expression. Therefore, currently, analyses of non-coding RNA 
transcriptomics have been oriented towards human samples. The present review 
develops a comparative study emphasizing the relevance of microRNAs, long 
non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs as potential biomarkers in heart failure. 
Significantly, further studies in this field of research are fundamental to 
supporting their widespread clinical use. In this sense, the various 
methodologies used by the authors should be standardized, including larger 
cohorts, homogeneity of the samples and uniformity of the bioinformatic 
pipelines used to reach stratification and statistical significance of the 
results. These basic adjustments could provide promising steps to designing 
novel strategies for clinical management of patients with heart failure."
2067,"Hormonally upregulated neu-associated kinase (HUNK) is a serine/threonine (S/T) 
protein kinase related to the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase 
(AMPK) family of kinases. HUNK was originally discovered using a screen to 
identify kinases expressed in the mouse mammary gland. Therefore, the majority 
of studies to date have been carried out in models specific to this tissue, and 
the kinase was named to reflect its mammary gland-specific physiology and 
pathology. Prior studies show a clear pathogenic role for HUNK in breast cancer. 
HUNK is upregulated in response to oncogenic HER2/neu and Akt, and there is 
strong evidence that HUNK is critical for the survival of breast cancer cells. 
Further evidence shows that inhibiting HUNK using a variety of breast cancer 
models, including those that are resistant, inhibits tumorigenesis and 
metastasis. However, HUNK alterations are infrequent. Here, the incidence and 
consequence of HUNK alterations in breast cancer is reviewed using data mined 
from the online database cBioPortal and considered in relation to prior research 
studies."
2068,"A recent study has shown that DNA hypermethylation can promote ischemia 
reperfusion (I/R) injury by regulating the mitochondrial function. Diabetes 
mellitus (DM) is reported to induce DNA hypermethylation, but whether this prior 
DNA methylation in DM I/R heart inflicts a beneficial or detrimental effect is 
not known and is addressed in this study. DM was induced in 6-week-old male 
Wistar rats with streptozotocin (65 mg/kg b.wt). After 24 weeks on a normal 
diet, I/R was induced in rat heart using a Langendorff perfusion system and 
analyzed the myocardium for different parameters to measure hemodynamics, 
infarct size, DNA methylation and mitochondrial function. Diabetic heart 
exhibited DNA hypermethylation of 39% compared to the control, along with DNMT 
expression elevated by 41%. I/R induction in diabetic heart promoted further DNA 
hypermethylation (24%) with aggravated infarct size (21%) and reduced the 
cardiac rate pressure product (43%) from I/R heart. Importantly, diabetic I/R 
hearts also experienced a decline in the mitochondrial copy number (60%); 
downregulation in the expression of mitochondrial bioenergetics (ND1, ND2, ND3, 
ND4, ND5, ND6) and mitofusion (MFN1, MFN2) genes and the upregulation of 
mitophagy (PINK, PARKIN, OPTN) and mitofission (MFF, DNM1, FIS1) genes that 
reduce the dp/dt contribute to the contractile dysfunction in DM I/R hearts. 
Besides, a negative correlation was obtained between mitochondrial PGC1α, POLGA, 
TFAM genes and DNA hypermethylation in DM I/R hearts. Based on the above data, 
the elevated global DNA methylation level in diabetic I/R rat hearts 
deteriorated the mitochondrial function by downregulating the expression of 
POLGA, TFAM and PGC1α genes and negatively contributed to I/R-associated 
increased infarct size and altered hemodynamics."
2069,"CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7, which are located in a multigene locus (CYP3A), play 
crucial roles in drug metabolism. To understand the highly variable hepatic 
expression of CYP3As, regulatory network analyses have focused on transcription 
factors (TFs). Since long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) likely contribute to such 
networks, we assessed the regulatory effects of both TFs and lncRNAs on CYP3A 
expression in the human liver and small intestine, main organs of CYP3A 
expression. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of GTEx 
v8 RNA expression data and multiple stepwise regression analysis, we constructed 
TF-lncRNA-CYP3A co-expression networks. Multiple lncRNAs and TFs displayed 
robust associations with CYP3A expression that differed between liver and small 
intestines (LINC02499, HNF4A-AS1, AC027682.6, LOC102724153, and RP11-503C24.6), 
indicating that lncRNAs contribute to variance in CYP3A expression in both 
organs. Of these, HNF4A-AS1 had been experimentally demonstrated to affect CYP3A 
expression. Incorporating ncRNAs into CYP3A expression regulatory network 
revealed additional candidate TFs associated with CYP3A expression. These 
results serve as a guide for experimental studies on lncRNA-TF regulation of 
CYP3A expression in the liver and small intestines."
2070,"The monolayer of cells that line both the heart and the entire vasculature is 
the endothelial cell (EC). These cells respond to external and internal signals, 
producing a wide array of primary or secondary messengers involved in 
coagulation, vascular tone, inflammation, and cell-to-cell signaling. 
Endothelial cell activation is the process by which EC changes from a quiescent 
cell phenotype, which maintains cellular integrity, antithrombotic, and 
anti-inflammatory properties, to a phenotype that is prothrombotic, 
pro-inflammatory, and permeable, in addition to repair and leukocyte trafficking 
at the site of injury or infection. Pathological activation of EC leads to 
increased vascular permeability, thrombosis, and an uncontrolled inflammatory 
response that leads to endothelial dysfunction. This pathological activation can 
be observed during ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and sepsis. Shear stress 
(SS) and pulsatile shear stress (PSS) are produced by mechanical frictional 
forces of blood flow and contraction of the heart, respectively, and are 
well-known mechanical signals that affect EC function, morphology, and gene 
expression. PSS promotes EC homeostasis and cardiovascular health. The archetype 
of inducing PSS is exercise (i.e., jogging, which introduces pulsations to the 
body as a function of the foot striking the pavement), or mechanical devices 
which induce external pulsations to the body (Enhanced External Pulsation 
(EECP), Whole-body vibration (WBV), and Whole-body periodic acceleration (WBPA 
aka pGz)). The purpose of this narrative review is to focus on the 
aforementioned noninvasive methods to increase PSS, review how each of these 
modify specific diseases that have been shown to induce endothelial activation 
and microcirculatory dysfunction (Ischemia reperfusion injury-myocardial 
infarction and cardiac arrest and resuscitation), sepsis, and 
lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis syndrome (LPS)), and review current evidence 
and insight into how each may modify endothelial activation and how these may be 
beneficial in the acute and chronic setting of endothelial activation and 
microvascular dysfunction."
2071,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing epidemic and the most 
common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. It consists of a spectrum of 
liver disorders ranging from simple steatosis to NASH which predisposes patients 
to further fibrosis, cirrhosis and even hepatocarcinoma. Despite much research, 
an approved treatment is still lacking. Finding new therapeutic targets has 
therefore been a main priority. Known as a main regulator of the lipid 
metabolism and highly expressed in the liver, the nuclear receptor peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) has been identified as an attractive 
therapeutic target. Since its expression is silenced by DNA hypermethylation in 
NAFLD patients, many research strategies have aimed to restore the expression of 
PPARα and its target genes involved in lipid metabolism. Although previously 
tested PPARα agonists did not ameliorate the disease, current research has shown 
that PPARα also interacts and regulates epigenetic DNMT1, JMJD3, TET and SIRT1 
enzymes. Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting the 
orchestrating role of epigenetics in the development and progression of NAFLD. 
Therefore, current therapeutic strategies are shifting more towards epigenetic 
drugs. This review provides a concise overview of the epigenetic regulation of 
NAFLD with a focus on PPARα regulation and highlights recently identified 
epigenetic interaction partners of PPARα."
2072,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a group of heterogeneous progressive 
pulmonary disorders, characterised by tissue remodelling and/or fibrotic 
scarring of the lung parenchyma. ILD patients experience lung function decline 
with progressive symptoms, poor response to treatment, reduced quality of life 
and high mortality. ILD can be idiopathic or associated with systemic or 
connective tissue diseases (CTD) but idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the 
most common form. While IPF has a male predominance, women are affected more 
greatly by CTD and therefore associated ILDs. The mechanisms behind biological 
sex differences in these progressive lung diseases remain unclear. However, 
differences in environmental exposures, variable expression of X-chromosome 
related inflammatory genes and sex hormones play a role. Here, we will outline 
sex-related differences in the incidence, progression and mechanisms of action 
of these diseases and discuss existing and novel cellular and pre-clinical 
studies. Furthermore, we will highlight how sex-differences are not adequately 
considered in pre-clinical disease models, how gender bias exists in clinical 
diagnosis and how women are underrepresented in clinical trials. Future action 
on these observations will hopefully shed light on the role of biological sex in 
disease development, identify potential targets for intervention and increase 
female participant numbers in clinical trials."
2073,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T adoptive cell therapy is one of the most 
promising advanced therapies for the treatment of cancer, with unprecedented 
outcomes in haematological malignancies. However, it still lacks efficacy in 
solid tumours, possibly because engineered T cells become inactive within the 
immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME). In the TME, cells of the 
myeloid lineage (M) are among the immunosuppressive cell types with the highest 
tumour infiltration rate. These cells interact with other immune cells, 
mediating immunosuppression and promoting angiogenesis. Recently, the 
development of CAR-M cell therapies has been put forward as a new candidate 
immunotherapy with good efficacy potential. This alternative CAR strategy may 
increase the efficacy, survival, persistence, and safety of CAR treatments in 
solid tumours. This remains a critical frontier in cancer research and opens up 
a new possibility for next-generation personalised medicine to overcome TME 
resistance. However, the exact mechanisms of action of CAR-M and their effect on 
the TME remain poorly understood. Here, we summarise the basic, translational, 
and clinical results of CAR-innate immune cells and CAR-M cell immunotherapies, 
from their engineering and mechanistic studies to preclinical and clinical 
development."
2074,"The poultry industry in developing countries still faces a significant threat 
from fowl typhoid, a disease caused by Salmonella Gallinarum that has been well 
contained in more economically developed countries. In addition to the virulence 
exhibited by large virulence plasmid (85 kb), Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 
in S. Gallinarum plays a key role in mediating disease through its type III 
secretion systems (TTSS). The TTSS secrete effector protein across the 
Salmonella containing vacuoles and mediate the internalization of bacteria by 
modulating vesicular passage. In this study, candidate virulent ssaU gene (~1 
kb) encoding type III secretion system was successfully deleted from 
indigenously isolated S. Gallinarum genome through homology-directed repair 
using CRISPR/Cas9 and lambda recombination systems. CRISPR/Cas9-based genome 
editing of poultry-derived Salmonella Gallinarum has not been previously 
reported, which might be linked to a lack of efficiency in its genetic tools. 
This is the first study which demonstrates a complete CRISPR/Cas9-based gene 
deletion from this bacterial genome. More importantly, a poultry experimental 
model was employed to assess the virulence potential of this mutant strain 
(ΔssaU_SG18) which was unable to produce any mortality in the experimentally 
challenged birds as compared to the wild type strain. No effect on weight gain 
was observed whereas bacteria were unable to colonize the intestine and liver in 
our challenge model. This in vivo loss of virulence in mutant strain provides an 
excellent functionality of this system to be useful in live vaccine development 
against this resistant and patho genic bacteria."
2075,"Congenital solitary functioning kidney (CSFK) is a birth defect that occurs in 
1:1500 children and predisposes them to kidney injury. Its aetiology is likely 
multifactorial. In addition to known monogenic causes and environmental risk 
factors, common genetic variation may contribute to susceptibility to CSFK. We 
performed a genome-wide association study among 452 patients with CSFK and two 
control groups of 669 healthy children and 5363 unaffected adults. Variants in 
two loci reached the genome-wide significance threshold of 5 × 10-8, and 
variants in 30 loci reached the suggestive significance threshold of 1 × 10-5. 
Of these, an identified locus with lead single nucleotide variant (SNV) 
rs140804918 (odds ratio 3.1, p-value = 1.4 × 10-8) on chromosome 7 was most 
promising due to its close proximity to HGF, a gene known to be involved in 
kidney development. Based on their known molecular functions, both KCTD20 and 
STK38 could explain the suggestive significant association with lead SNV 
rs148413365 on chromosome 6. Our findings need replication in an independent 
cohort of CSFK patients before they can be established definitively. However, 
our analysis suggests that common variants play a role in CSFK aetiology. Future 
research could enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved."
2076,"Macrophages play a key role in the inflammatory phase of wound repair and 
foreign body reactions-two important processes in the Masquelet-induced membrane 
technique for extremity reconstruction. The macrophage response depends largely 
on the nature of the biomaterials implanted. However, little is known about the 
influence of the macrophage microenvironment on the osteogenic properties of the 
induced membrane or subsequent bone regeneration. We used metakaolin, an 
immunogenic material, as an alternative spacer to standard 
polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in a Masquelet model in rats. Four weeks after 
implantation, the PMMA- and metakaolin-induced membranes were harvested, and 
their osteogenic properties and macrophage microenvironments were investigated 
by histology, immunohistochemistry, mass spectroscopy and gene expression 
analysis. The metakaolin spacer induced membranes with higher levels of two 
potent pro-osteogenic factors, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and bone 
morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2). These alternative membranes thus had greater 
osteogenic activity, which was accompanied by a significant expansion of the 
total macrophage population, including both the M1-like and M2-like subtypes. 
Microcomputed tomographic analysis showed that metakaolin-induced membranes 
supported bone regeneration more effectively than PMMA-induced membranes through 
better callus properties (+58%), although this difference was not significant. 
This study provides the first evidence of the influence of the immune 
microenvironment on the osteogenic properties of the induced membranes."
2077,"The microbiome shapes the mature T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and thereby 
influences pathogen control. To investigate microbiome influences on T cells at 
an earlier, immature stage, we compared single-cell TCR transcript sequences 
between CD4+CD8+ (double-positive) thymocytes from gnotobiotic [E. coli 
mono-associated (Ec)] and germ-free (GF) mice. Identical TCRβ transcripts 
(termed repeat, REP) were more often shared between cells of individual Ec mice 
compared to GF mice (Fishers Exact test, p &lt; 0.0001). Among Ec REPs, a 
cluster of Vβ genes (Vβ12-1, 12-2, 13-1, and 13-2, termed 12-13) was well 
represented, whereas 12-13 sequences were not detected among GF REPs (Fishers 
Exact test, p = 0.046). Vα genes located in the distal region of the TCRα locus 
were more frequently expressed in Ec mice compared to GF mice, both among REPs 
and total sequences (Fishers Exact test, p = 0.009). Results illustrate how gut 
bacteria shape the TCR repertoire, not simply among mature T cells, but among 
immature CD4+CD8+ thymocytes."
2078,"BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most commonly 
detected neoplasms worldwide. Not all mechanisms associated with cell cycle 
disturbances are known in OSCC. Examples of genes involved in the control of the 
cell cycle are CDKN2A, MDM2, E2F2 and LTF. The aim of this study was to examine 
the possible association between CDKN2A, MDM2, E2F2 and LTF mRNA expression and 
influence on clinical variables.
METHODS: The study group consisted of 88 Polish patients. The gene expression 
levels were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR.
RESULTS: We found no statistically significant differences in the expression 
level of CDKN2A, MDM2, E2F2 and LTF genes in tumour samples compared to margin 
samples. No association was found between the gene expression levels and 
clinical parameters, except E2F2. The patients with G2 tumours had a 
significantly higher gene expression level of E2F2 than patients with low-grade 
G1 tumours.
CONCLUSIONS: We have not demonstrated that a change in expression profiles of 
genes has a significant impact on the pathogenesis of OSCC. It may also be 
useful to conduct further studies on the use of E2F2 expression profile changes 
as a factor to describe the invasiveness and dynamics of OSCC development."
2079,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles before and after 
pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in the cornu ammonis (CA) and 
dentated gyrus (DG) areas of the mouse hippocampus, and to predict the 
downstream proteins and related pathways based on bioinformatic analysis.
METHODS: An epileptic mouse model was established using a pilocarpine injection. 
Brain tissues from the CA and DG were collected separately for miRNA analysis. 
The miRNAs were extracted using a kit, and the expression profiles were 
generated using the SurePrint G3 Mouse miRNA microarray and validated. The 
intersecting genes of TargetScan and miRanda were selected to predict the target 
genes of each miRNA. For gene ontology (GO) studies, the 
parent-child-intersection (pci) method was used for enrichment analysis, and 
Benjamini-Hochberg was used for multiple test correction. The Kyoto Encyclopedia 
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was used to detect disease-related pathways among 
the large list of miRNA-targeted genes. All analyses mentioned above were 
performed at the time points of control, days 3, 14, and 60 post-SE.
RESULTS: Control versus days 3, 14, and 60 post-SE: in the CA area, a total of 
131 miRNAs were differentially expressed; 53, 49, and 26 miRNAs were upregulated 
and 54, 10, and 22 were downregulated, respectively. In the DG area, a total of 
171 miRNAs were differentially expressed; furthermore, 36, 32, and 28 miRNAs 
were upregulated and 78, 58, and 44 were downregulated, respectively. Of these, 
92 changed in both the CA and DG, 39 only in the CA, and 79 only in the DG area. 
The differentially expressed miRNAs target 11-1630 genes. Most of these proteins 
have multiple functions in epileptogenesis. There were 15 common pathways 
related to altered miRNAs: nine different pathways in the CA and seven in the DG 
area.
CONCLUSIONS: Stage- and subfield-associated hippocampal miRNA expression 
patterns are closely related to epileptogenesis, although the detailed 
mechanisms need to be explored in the future."
2080,"Comprehensive genomic profiling examinations (CGPs) have recently been 
developed, and a variety of tumor-agnostic mutations have been detected, leading 
to the development of new molecular-targetable therapies across solid tumors. In 
addition, the elucidation of hereditary tumors, such as breast and ovarian 
cancer, has pioneered a new age marked by the development of new treatments and 
lifetime management strategies required for patients with potential or presented 
hereditary cancers. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, few tumor-agnostic 
or hereditary mutations have been the focus of investigation, with associated 
molecular-targeted therapies remaining poorly developed. We focused on 
representative tumor-agnostic mutations such as the TP53, KIT, KRAS, BRCA1, ATM, 
JAK2, NTRK3, FGFR3 and EGFR genes, referring to a CGP study conducted in Japan, 
and we considered the possibility of developing molecular-targeted therapies for 
AML with tumor-agnostic mutations. We summarized the frequency, the prognosis, 
the structure and the function of these mutations as well as the current 
treatment strategies in solid tumors, revealed the genetical relationships 
between solid tumors and AML and developed tumor-agnostic molecular-targeted 
therapies and lifetime management strategies in AML."
2081,"At least 50% of factors predisposing to alcohol dependence (AD) are genetic and 
women affected with this disorder present with more psychiatric comorbidities, 
probably indicating different genetic factors involved. We aimed to run a 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) followed by a bioinformatic functional 
annotation of associated genomic regions in patients with AD and eight related 
clinical measures. A genome-wide significant association of rs220677 with AD 
(p-value = 1.33 × 10-8 calculated with the Yates-corrected χ2 test under the 
assumption of dominant inheritance) was discovered in female patients. 
Associations of AD and related clinical measures with seven other single 
nucleotide polymorphisms listed in previous GWASs of psychiatric and addiction 
traits were differently replicated in male and female patients. The 
bioinformatic analysis showed that regulatory elements in the eight associated 
linkage disequilibrium blocks define the expression of 80 protein-coding genes. 
Nearly 68% of these and of 120 previously published coding genes associated with 
alcohol phenotypes directly interact in a single network, where BDNF is the most 
significant hub gene. This study indicates that several genes behind the 
pathogenesis of AD are different in male and female patients, but implicated 
molecular mechanisms are functionally connected. The study also reveals a 
central role of BDNF in the pathogenesis of AD."
2082,"BACKGROUND: A 23-gene classifier has been developed based on gene expression 
profiles of Taiwanese luminal-like breast cancer. We aim to stratify risk of 
relapse and identify patients who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy based 
on genetic model among distinct clinical risk groups.
METHODS: There were 248 luminal (hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal 
growth factor receptor II-negative) breast cancer patients with 23-gene 
classifier results. Using the modified Adjuvant! Online definition, clinical 
high/low-risk groups were tabulated with the genetic model. The primary endpoint 
was a recurrence-free interval (RFI) at 5 years.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the high/low-risk groups 
defined by the 23-gene classifier for the 5-year prognosis of recurrence (16 
recurrences in high-risk and 3 recurrences in low-risk; log-rank test: p &lt; 
0.0001). Among the clinically high-risk group, the 5-year RFI of high risk 
defined by the 23-gene classifier was significantly higher than that of the 
low-risk group (15 recurrences in high-risk and 2 recurrences in low-risk; 
log-rank test: p &lt; 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This study showed that 23-gene classifier can be used to stratify 
clinically high-risk patients into distinct survival patterns based on genomic 
risks and displays the potentiality to guide adjuvant chemotherapy. The 23-gene 
classifier can provide a better estimation of breast cancer prognosis which can 
help physicians make a better treatment decision."
2083,"MiR-22 was first identified as a proto-oncogenic microRNA (miRNA) due to its 
ability to post-transcriptionally suppress the expression of the potent PTEN 
(Phosphatase And Tensin Homolog) tumor suppressor gene. miR-22 tumorigenic role 
in cancer was subsequently supported by its ability to positively trigger 
lipogenesis, anabolic metabolism, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
towards the metastatic spread. However, during the following years, the picture 
was complicated by the identification of targets that support a 
tumor-suppressive role in certain tissues or cell types. Indeed, many papers 
have been published where in vitro cellular assays and in vivo immunodeficient 
or immunosuppressed xenograft models are used. However, here we show that all 
the studies performed in vivo, in immunocompetent transgenic and knock-out 
animal models, unanimously support a proto-oncogenic role for miR-22. Since 
miR-22 is actively secreted from and readily exchanged between normal and 
tumoral cells, a functional immune dimension at play could well represent the 
divider that allows reconciling these contradictory findings. In addition to a 
critical review of this vast literature, here we provide further proof of the 
oncogenic role of miR-22 through the analysis of its genomic locus vis a vis the 
genetic landscape of human cancer."
2084,"INTRODUCTION: Factors other than PD-L1 (Programmed Death Ligand 1) are being 
sought as predictors for cancer immuno- or chemoimmunotherapy in ongoing studies 
and long-term observations. Despite high PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, some 
patients do not benefit from immunotherapy, while others, without the expression 
of this molecule, respond to immunotherapy. Attention has been paid to the 
composition of the gut microbiome as a potential predictive factor for 
immunotherapy effectiveness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study enrolled 47 Caucasian patients with stage IIIB 
or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). They were eligible for treatment with 
first- or second-line immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. We collected stool 
samples before the administration of immunotherapy. We performed next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) on DNA isolated from the stool sample and analyzed bacterial V3 
and V4 of the 16S rRNA gene.
RESULTS: We found that bacteria from the families Barnesiellaceae, 
Ruminococcaceae, Tannerellaceae, and Clostridiaceae could modulate immunotherapy 
effectiveness. A high abundance of Bacteroidaaceae, Barnesiellaceae, and 
Tannerellaceae could extend progression-free survival (PFS). Moreover, the risk 
of death was significantly higher in patients with a high content of 
Ruminococcaceae family (HR = 6.3, 95% CI: 2.6 to 15.3, p &lt; 0.0001) and in 
patients with a low abundance of Clostridia UCG-014 (HR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5 to 
9.8, p = 0.005) regardless of the immunotherapy line.
CONCLUSIONS: The Clostridia class in gut microbiota could affect the 
effectiveness of immunotherapy, as well as the length of survival of NSCLC 
patients who received this method of treatment."
2085,"Central nervous system (CNS) metastatic spread in neuroblastoma (NB) is rare and 
occurs more often at relapse/progression. We report on CNS involvement in high 
risk (HR) NB over 25 years. For this retrospective study, we reviewed the CNS 
imaging of all the patients treated at Bambino Gesù Children Hospital from 1 
July 1996 to 30 June 2022. A total of 128 patients with HR NB were diagnosed 
over 26 years. Out of 128 patients, CNS metastatic spread occurred in 6 
patients: 3 patients presented a metastatic spread at diagnosis, while in 3 
patients, CNS was involved at relapse. Overall, the rate of occurrence of CNS 
spread is 4.7% with the same distribution at diagnosis and at relapse, namely 
2.3%. Interestingly, CNS spread at diagnosis was observed only before 2012, 
whereas CNS was observed at relapse only after 2012, in the immunotherapy era. 
CNS metastases presented similar imaging features at diagnosis and at relapse, 
with a peculiar hemorrhagic aspect and mainly hemispheric localization in 
patients with bone skull involvement at the time of diagnosis. The outcome is 
dismal, and 3 out of 6 patients died for progressive disease."
2086,"In the United States, over 100,000 women are diagnosed with a gynecologic 
malignancy every year, with ovarian cancer being the most lethal. One of the 
hallmark characteristics of ovarian cancer is the development of resistance to 
chemotherapeutics. While the exact mechanisms of chemoresistance are poorly 
understood, it is known that changes at the cellular and molecular level make 
chemoresistance challenging to treat. Improved therapeutic options are needed to 
target these changes at the molecular level. Using a precision medicine 
approach, such as gene therapy, genes can be specifically exploited to 
resensitize tumors to therapeutics. This review highlights traditional and novel 
gene targets that can be used to develop new and improved targeted therapies, 
from drug efflux proteins to ovarian cancer stem cells. The review also 
addresses the clinical relevance and landscape of the discussed gene targets."
2087,"Accurate detection of HER2 expression through immunohistochemistry (IHC) is of 
great clinical significance in the treatment of breast cancer. However, manual 
interpretation of HER2 is challenging, due to the interobserver variability 
among pathologists. We sought to explore a deep learning method to predict HER2 
expression level and gene status based on a Whole Slide Image (WSI) of the HER2 
IHC section. When applied to 228 invasive breast carcinoma of no special type 
(IBC-NST) DAB-stained slides, our GrayMap+ convolutional neural network (CNN) 
model accurately classified HER2 IHC level with mean accuracy 0.952 ± 0.029 and 
predicted HER2 FISH status with mean accuracy 0.921 ± 0.029. Our result also 
demonstrated strong consistency in HER2 expression score between our system and 
experienced pathologists (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.903, 
Cohen's κ = 0.875). The discordant cases were found to be largely caused by high 
intra-tumor staining heterogeneity in the HER2 IHC group and low copy number in 
the HER2 FISH group."
2088,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) oncogenesis is mainly driven by VHL gene 
inactivation, leading to overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF). The use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) directed against VEGF and 
its receptor (VEGFR) revolutionised the management of metastatic renal cancer in 
the 2000s. The more recent development of next-generation TKIs such as 
cabozantinib or lenvatinib has made it possible to bypass some of the mechanisms 
of resistance to first-generation anti-VEGFR TKIs. During the decade 2010-2020, 
the development of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies revolutionised the 
management of many solid cancers, including RCC, in first- and subsequent-line 
settings. Dual ICB or ICB plus anti-VEGFR TKI combinations are now the standard 
of care for patients with advanced clear cell RCC. To optimise these combination 
therapies while preserving patient quality of life, escalation and de-escalation 
strategies are being evaluated in prospective randomised trials, based on 
patient selection according to their prognosis risk. Finally, new therapeutic 
approaches, such as targeting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and the development 
of innovative treatments using antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), CAR-T cells, or 
radiopharmaceuticals, are all potential candidates to improve further patient 
survival."
2089,"Mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1MUT) gene occur in various 
types of malignancies, including ~60% of chondrosarcomas, ~30% of intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinomas and &gt;80% of low-grade gliomas. IDH1MUT are causal in the 
development and progression of these types of cancer due to neomorphic 
production of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). Intracellular 
accumulation of D-2HG has been implicated in suppressing homologous 
recombination and renders IDH1MUT cancer cells sensitive to 
DNA-repair-inhibiting agents, such as poly-(adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose) 
polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Hyperthermia increases the efficacy of 
DNA-damaging therapies such as radiotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy, 
mainly by inhibition of DNA repair. In the current study, we investigated the 
additional effects of hyperthermia (42 °C for 1 h) in the treatment of IDH1MUT 
HCT116 colon cancer cells and hyperthermia1080 chondrosarcoma cancer cells in 
combination with radiation, cisplatin and/or a PARPi on clonogenic cell 
survival, cell cycle distribution and the induction and repair of DNA 
double-strand breaks. We found that hyperthermia in combination with radiation 
or cisplatin induces an increase in double-strand breaks and cell death, up to 
10-fold in IDH1MUT cancer cells compared to IDH1 wild-type cells. This 
vulnerability was abolished by the IDH1MUT inhibitor AGI-5198 and was further 
increased by the PARPi. In conclusion, our study shows that IDH1MUT cancer cells 
are sensitized to hyperthermia in combination with irradiation or cisplatin and 
a PARPi. Therefore, hyperthermia may be an efficacious sensitizer to cytotoxic 
therapies in tumors where the clinical application of hyperthermia is feasible, 
such as IDH1MUT chondrosarcoma of the extremities."
2090,"Meningiomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system. 
Based on the 2021 WHO classification, they are classified into three grades 
reflecting recurrence risk and aggressiveness. However, the WHO's 
histopathological criteria defining these grades are somewhat subjective. 
Together with reliable immunohistochemical proliferation indices, other 
molecular markers such as those studied with genome-wide epigenetics promise to 
revamp the current prognostic classification. In this study, 48 meningiomas of 
various grades were randomly included and explored for DNA methylation with the 
Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray over 850k CpG sites. We conducted 
differential and correlative analyses on grade and several proliferation indices 
and markers, such as mitotic index and Ki-67 or MCM6 immunohistochemistry. We 
also set up Cox proportional hazard models for extensive associations between 
CpG methylation and survival. We identified loci highly correlated with cell 
growth and a targeted methylation signature of regulatory regions persistently 
associated with proliferation, grade, and survival. Candidate genes under the 
control of these regions include SMC4, ESRRG, PAX6, DOK7, VAV2, OTX1, and 
PCDHA-PCDHB-PCDHG, i.e., the protocadherin gene clusters. This study highlights 
the crucial role played by epigenetic mechanisms in shaping dysregulated 
cellular proliferation and provides potential biomarkers bearing prognostic and 
therapeutic value for the clinical management of meningioma."
2091,"We investigate whether computed tomography (CT) derived radiomics may correlate 
with driver gene mutations in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC). In this retrospective study, 47 patients (mean age 64 ± 11 years; range: 
42-86 years) with PDAC, who were treated surgically and who underwent 
preoperative CT imaging at our institution were included in the study. Image 
segmentation and feature extraction was performed semi-automatically with a 
commonly used open-source software platform. Genomic data from whole genome 
sequencing (WGS) were collected from our institution's web-based resource. Two 
statistical models were then built, in order to evaluate the predictive ability 
of CT-derived radiomics feature for driver gene mutations in PDAC. 30/47 of all 
tumor samples harbored 2 or more gene mutations. Overall, 81% of tumor samples 
demonstrated mutations in KRAS, 68% of samples had alterations in TP53, 26% in 
SMAD4 and 19% in CDKN2A. Extended statistical analysis revealed acceptable 
predictive ability for KRAS and TP53 (Youden Index 0.56 and 0.67, respectively) 
and mild to acceptable predictive signal for SMAD4 and CDKN2A (Youden Index 0.5, 
respectively). Our study establishes acceptable correlation of radiomics 
features and driver gene mutations in PDAC, indicating an acceptable 
prognostication of genomic profiles using CT-derived radiomics. A larger and 
more homogenous cohort may further enhance the predictive ability."
2092,"Doublesex and Mab-3 related Transcription Factor 3 (DMRT3) is associated with 
the prognosis of some tumors. It is possible to explore the role of DMRT3 in the 
cancer process using bioinformatic approaches and experimental validation. We 
comprehensively explored the clinical and immunological characteristics of 
DMRT3. The DMRT3 expression is abnormal in human cancers and correlates with 
clinical staging. A high DMRT3 expression is significantly associated with poor 
overall survival (OS) in KIRC, KIRP, LUAD, and UCEC. Amplification was the 
greatest frequency of the DMRT3 alterations in pan-cancer. The OS was 
significantly lower in the DMRT3 altered group than in the DMRT3 unaltered group 
(P = 0.0276). The DMRT3 expression was significantly associated with MSI in 
three cancer types and TMB in six cancer types. The DMRT3 expression was 
significantly correlated with the level of the immune cell infiltration and the 
immune checkpoint genes. The DMRT3 was involved in some pathways in pan-cancer. 
DMRT3 may play a role in chemotherapy and may be associated with 
chemoresistance. A ceRNA network of KCNQ1OT1/miR-335-5p/DMRT3 was constructed in 
LUAD. DMRT3 was significantly upregulated in the LUAD cell lines. DMRT3 was 
aberrantly expressed in pan-cancer and may promote tumorigenesis and progression 
via different mechanisms. DMRT3 can be used as a therapeutic target to treat 
cancer in humans."
2093,"The Hippo pathway is an evolutionarily conserved modulator of developmental 
biology with a key role in tissue and organ size regulation under homeostatic 
conditions. Like other signaling pathways with a significant role in embryonic 
development, the deregulation of Hippo signaling contributes to oncogenesis. 
Central to the Hippo pathway is a conserved cascade of adaptor proteins and 
inhibitory kinases that converge and regulate the activity of the oncoproteins 
YAP and TAZ, the final transducers of the pathway. Elevated levels and aberrant 
activation of YAP and TAZ have been described in many cancers. Though most of 
the studies describe their pervasive activation in epithelial neoplasms, there 
is increasing evidence pointing out its relevance in mesenchymal malignancies as 
well. Interestingly, somatic or germline mutations in genes of the Hippo pathway 
are scarce compared to other signaling pathways that are frequently disrupted in 
cancer. However, in the case of sarcomas, several examples of genetic alteration 
of Hippo members, including gene fusions, have been described during the last 
few years. Here, we review the current knowledge of Hippo pathway implication in 
sarcoma, describing mechanistic hints recently reported in specific histological 
entities and how these alterations represent an opportunity for targeted therapy 
in this heterogeneous group of neoplasm."
2094,"In metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), the clinical response to immune 
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is limited in a subset of patients and the need 
exists to identify non-invasive, blood-based, predictive biomarkers for 
responses. We performed RNA sequencing using whole-blood samples prospectively 
collected from 49 patients with mRCC prior to the administration of ipilimumab 
(IPI) and/or nivolumab (NIVO) to determine whether gene expression profiles were 
associated with responses. An analysis from 33 mRCC patients with complete 
responses (n = 5), partial responses (n = 14), and progressive disease (n = 14) 
showed 460 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to immune responses 
between the responder and non-responder groups with significant differences. A 
set of 14 genes generated from the initial 460 DEGs accurately classified 
responders (sensitivity 94.7% and specificity 50.0%) while consensus clustering 
defined clusters with significantly differing response rates (92.3% and 35.0%). 
These clustering results were replicated in a cohort featuring 16 additional SD 
patients (49 total patients): response rates were 95.8% and 48.0%. Collectively, 
whole-blood gene expression profiles derived from mRCC patients treated with 
ICIs clearly differed by response and hierarchical clustering using immune 
response DEGs accurately classified responder patients. These results suggest 
that such screening may serve as a predictor for ICI responses in mRCC patients."
2095,"Melanoma is a severe skin cancer affecting thousands of people and a growing 
public health concern worldwide. The potential hallmarks of melanoma are genetic 
instability and mutation (GIAM), which are driving mechanisms for phenotypic 
variation and adaptation in melanoma. In metastatic melanoma, DNA 
repair-associated genes are frequently expressed at higher levels than in 
primary cancers, suggesting melanoma cells rely on genetic stability to spread 
distantly. The tumour microenvironment is affected by genomic instability and 
melanoma mutation (GIMM), which plays significant roles in developing GIMM and 
their contributions to the overall disease burden. The GIAM is the crucial 
vulnerability of cancer cells, determining their sensitivity to harmful 
treatments, including radiation and many chemotherapeutics. The high incidence 
of melanoma is typically associated with genetic modifications, and several 
clinical and genetic interventions have been critical in easing the burden."
2096,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone tumor in children and 
adolescents characterized by drug resistance and poor prognosis. As one of the 
key oncogenes, c-Met is recognized as a promising therapeutic target for OS. In 
this report, we show that c-Met inhibitor PF02341066 specifically killed OS 
cells with highly phosphorylated c-Met in vitro. However, the inhibitory effect 
of PF02341066 was abrogated in vivo due to interference from the vascular niche. 
OS cells adjacent to microvessels or forming vascular mimicry suppressed c-Met 
expression and phosphorylation. Moreover, VEGFR2 was activated in OS cells and 
associated with acquired drug resistance. Dual targeting of c-Met and VEGFR2 
could effectively shrink the tumor size in a xenograft model. c-Met-targeted 
therapy combined with VEGFR2 inhibition might be beneficial to achieve an ideal 
therapeutic effect in OS patients. Together, our results confirm the pivotal 
role of tumor heterogeneity and the microenvironment in drug response and reveal 
the molecular mechanism underlying acquired drug resistance to c-Met-targeted 
therapy."
2097,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Although 
not frequent, it has a relevant social impact because the peak incidence 
coincides with the age of professional maturity. A number of novel treatments 
have been proposed, yet clinical trials have been disappointing. Recently, a 
phase II clinical trial (REGOMA) demonstrated that the multikinase inhibitor 
regorafenib significantly increased the median overall survival (OS) of GBM 
patients when compared to lomustine-treated patients. On this basis, the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2020 Guidelines included 
regorafenib as a preferred regimen in relapsed GBM treatment. Despite the use in 
GBM patients' therapy, little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing 
regorafenib effectiveness on the GBM tumor. Here we report an in vitro 
characterization of GBM tumor cells' response to regorafenib, performed both on 
cell lines and on patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs). Overall, regorafenib 
significantly reduced cell growth of 2D tumor cell cultures and of 3D tumor 
spheroids. Strikingly, this effect was accompanied by transcriptional regulation 
of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes and by an increased ability 
of surviving tumor cells to invade the surrounding matrix. Taken together, our 
data suggest that regorafenib limits cell growth, however, it might induce an 
invasive phenotype."
2098,"The Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily and 
is an essential bile acid (BA) receptor that regulates the expression of genes 
involved in the metabolism of BAs. FXR protects the liver from BA overload, 
which is a major etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma. Herein, we investigated 
the changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in hepatocytes by 
performing RNA-seq in combination with the Assay for Transposase-Accessible 
Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) using a novel FXR knockout 
mouse model (Fxrex5Δ: Nr1h4ex5Δ/ex5Δ) generated through CRISPR/Cas9. Consistent 
with previous Fxr knockout models, we found that Fxrex5Δ mice develop late-onset 
HCC associated with increased serum and hepatic BAs. FXR deletion was associated 
with a dramatic loss of chromatin accessibility, primarily at 
promoter-associated transcription factor binding sites. Importantly, several 
genes involved in BA biosynthesis and circadian rhythm were downregulated 
following loss of FXR, also displayed reduced chromatin accessibility at their 
promoter regions. Altogether, these findings suggest that FXR helps to maintain 
a transcriptionally active state by regulating chromatin accessibility through 
its binding and recruitment of transcription factors and coactivators."
2099,"Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is highly prevalent within the U.S., with studies 
estimating that over 80% of individuals will contract the virus in their 
lifetime. HPV is considered a primary risk factor for the development and 
progression of oropharyngeal cancers. The impact of the HPV virus's E6 and E7 
oncoproteins on cellular signaling pathways and genomic integration has been 
extensively characterized. Indirect genomic effects; however, remain relatively 
unidentified. In this study, we analyzed 83 HPV+ Head and Neck Squamous Cell 
Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients of varying HPV types. Expression counts of the HPV E6 
and E7 oncogenes were estimated across samples and correlated with genomic 
mutational classes. High expression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins was associated 
with a greater number of total point mutations, especially on chromosomes 1, 11, 
and 17, which have been implicated in HPV-mediated cancers in previous studies. 
Samples with high E6 and E7 expression also exhibited more frequent 
non-clustered structural variation and a lack of clustered variation altogether. 
Copy number segments were present with fewer number of repeats in high E6 and E7 
expression samples, which is known to correlate with decreased expression of 
affected genes. E6 and E7 expression was associated with increased activity of 
several cellular pathways associated in oncogenesis and telomere maintenance. In 
comprehensively characterizing the effects of the HPV oncoproteins on the human 
genome, potential mechanisms of HNSCC pathogenesis may be further elucidated."
2100,"The loss-of-function variants are thought to be associated with inflammation in 
the stomach. We here aimed to evaluate the extent and role of methylation at the 
SSTR2 promoter in inflammation and gastric tumor formation. A whole-genome 
bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed that the SSTR2 promoter was significantly 
hypermethylated in gastric tumors, dysplasia, and intestinal metaplasia compared 
to non-tumor tissues from patients with gastric cancer. Using public data, we 
confirmed SSTR2 promoter methylation in primary gastric tumors and intestinal 
metaplasia, and even aged gastric mucosae infected with Helicobacter pylori, 
suggesting that aberrant methylation is initiated in normal gastric mucosa. The 
loss-of-function of SSTR2 in SNU638 cell-induced cell proliferation in vitro, 
while stable transfection of SSTR2 in AGS and MKN74 cells inhibited cell 
proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. As revealed by a 
comparison of target genes differentially expressed in these cells with hallmark 
molecular signatures, inflammation-related pathways were distinctly induced in 
SSTR2-KO SNU638 cell. By contrast, inflammation-related pathways were inhibited 
in AGS and MKN74 cells ectopically expressing SSTR2. Collectively, we propose 
that SSTR2 silencing upon promoter methylation is initiated in aged gastric 
mucosae infected with H. pylori and promotes the establishment of an 
inflammatory microenvironment via the intrinsic pathway. These findings provide 
novel insights into the initiation of gastric carcinogenesis."
2101,"In recent years, the third member of the HER family, kinase impaired HER3, has 
become a target of interest in cancer as there is accumulating evidence that 
HER3 plays a role in tumor growth and progression. This review focuses on HER3 
activation in bladder, breast, colorectal, and lung cancer disease progression. 
HER3 mutations occur at a rate up to ~10% of tumors dependent on the tumor type. 
With patient tumors routinely sequenced for gene alterations in recent years, we 
have focused on HER3 mutations in bladder, breast, colon, and lung cancers 
particularly in response to targeted therapies and the potential to become a 
resistance mechanism. There are currently several HER3 targeting drugs in the 
pipeline, possibly improving outcomes for cancer patients with tumors containing 
HER3 activation and/or alterations."
2102,"Two vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, FLT-1 and KDR, are 
expressed preferentially in proliferating endothelium. There is increasing 
evidence that recombinant, soluble VEGF receptor domains interfering with VEGF 
signaling may inhibit in vivo neoangiogenesis, tumor growth and metastatic 
spread. We hypothesized that a soluble form of FLT-1 receptor (sFLT-1) could 
inhibit the growth of pre-established tumors via an anti-angiogenic mechanism. A 
replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad) vector carrying the sflt-1 cDNA (Adsflt) 
was used to overexpress the sFLT-1 receptor in a breast cancer animal model. 
MCF-7 cells, which produce VEGF, were used to establish solid tumors in the 
mammary fat pads of female nude mice. After six weeks, tumors were injected 
either with Adsflt or a negative control virus (AdCMV.βgal). After six months, 
average tumor volume in the Adsflt-infected group (33 ± 22 mm3) decreased by 91% 
relative to that of the negative control group (388 ± 94 mm3; p &lt; 0.05). 
Moreover, 10 of 15 Adsflt-infected tumors exhibited complete regression. The 
vascular density of Adsflt-infected tumors was reduced by 50% relative to that 
of negative controls (p &lt; 0.05), which is consistent with sFLT-1-mediated 
tumor regression through an anti-angiogenic mechanism. Moreover, cell necrosis 
and fibrosis associated with long-term regression of Adsflt-infected tumors were 
preceded by apoptosis of tumor vascular endothelial cells. Mice treated with 
Adsflt intratumorally showed no delay in the healing of cutaneous wounds, 
providing preliminary evidence that Ad-mediated sFLT-1 overexpression may be an 
effective anti-angiogenic therapy for cancer without the risk of systemic 
anti-angiogenic effects."
2103,"Cancer research has benefited immensely from the use of animal models. Several 
genetic tools accessible in rodent models have provided valuable insight into 
cellular and molecular mechanisms linked to cancer development or metastasis and 
various lines are available. However, at the same time, it is important to 
accompany these findings with those from alternative or non-model animals to 
offer new perspectives into the understanding of tumor development, prevention, 
and treatment. In this review, we first discuss animals characterized by little 
or no tumor development. Cancer incidence in small animals, such as the naked 
mole rat, blind mole rat and bats have been reported as almost negligible and 
tumor development may be inhibited by increased defense and repair mechanisms, 
altered cell cycle signaling and reduced rates of cell migration to avoid tumor 
microenvironments. On the other end of the size spectrum, large animals such as 
elephants and whales also appear to have low overall cancer rates, possibly due 
to gene replicates that are involved in apoptosis and therefore can inhibit 
uncontrolled cell cycle progression. While it is important to determine the 
mechanisms that lead to cancer protection in these animals, we can also take 
advantage of other animals that are highly susceptible to cancer, especially 
those which develop tumors similar to humans, such as carnivores or poultry. The 
use of such animals does not require the transplantation of malignant cancer 
cells or use of oncogenic substances as they spontaneously develop tumors of 
similar presentation and pathophysiology to those found in humans. For example, 
some tumor suppressor genes are highly conserved between humans and domestic 
species, and various tumors develop in similar ways or because of a common 
environment. These animals are therefore of great interest for broadening 
perspectives and techniques and for gathering information on the tumor 
mechanisms of certain types of cancer. Here we present a detailed review of 
alternative and/or non-model vertebrates, that can be used at different levels 
of cancer research to open new perspectives and fields of action."
2104,"(1) Background: CD163, a specific macrophage receptor, affects the progression 
of malignant tumors. Unfortunately, the regulation and expression of CD163 are 
poorly understood. In this study, we determined the expressions of CD163 in TMA 
samples from CRC patients and combined them with patient data from several 
Swedish hospitals. (2) Methods: The expressions of CD163 in tissue samples from 
CRC patients were examined. After combining 472 CRC patients' gene expression 
and 438 CRC patients' clinical data with the TCGA database, 964 cases from the 
GEO database, and experimental expression data from 1247 Swedish CRC patients, 
we selected four genes (PCNA, LOX, BCL2, and CD163) and analyzed the 
tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) and CRC prognosis. (3) Results: Based on 
histopathological TMA analysis, CD163 was strongly expressed in the stroma of 
both normal and cancer tissues, and the expressions in normal and cancer cells 
varied from negative to strong. The results from public databases show decreased 
expression of CD163 in cancer tissue compared to normal mucosa (|log FC| &gt; 1 
and FDR &lt; 0.01), and it is a negative prognostic factor for CRC patients 
(p-value &lt; 0.05). Through tumor microenvironment (TME) analysis, we found a 
potential influence of CD163 on immune cell infiltration. Furthermore, the 
enrichment analysis indicated the possible interaction with other proteins and 
biological pathways. (4) Conclusions: CD163 is expressed differently in CRC 
tissue and is a negative prognostic factor. Its expression is associated with 
the TME and tumor purity of CRC. Considering all results, CD163 has the 
potential to be a predictive biomarker in the investigation of CRC."
2105,"Prostate cancer is very frequent and is, in many countries, the third-leading 
cause of cancer related death in men. While early diagnosis and treatment by 
surgical removal is often curative, metastasizing prostate cancer has a very bad 
prognosis. Based on the androgen-dependence of prostate epithelial cells, the 
standard treatment is blockade of the androgen receptor (AR). However, nearly 
all patients suffer from a tumor relapse as the metastasizing cells become 
AR-independent. In our study we show a counter-regulatory link between AR and 
NF-κB both in human cells and in mouse models of prostate cancer, implying that 
inhibition of AR signaling results in induction of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory 
pathways, which may even foster the survival of metastasizing cells. This could 
be shown by reporter gene assays, DNA-binding measurements, and 
immune-fluorescence microscopy, and furthermore by a whole set of computational 
methods using a variety of datasets. Interestingly, loss of PTEN, a frequent 
genetic alteration in prostate cancer, also causes an upregulation of NF-κB and 
inflammatory activity. Finally, we present a mathematical model of a dynamic 
network between AR, NF-κB/IκB, PI3K/PTEN, and the oncogene c-Myc, which 
indicates that AR blockade may upregulate c-Myc together with NF-κB, and that 
combined anti-AR/anti-NF-κB and anti-PI3K treatment might be beneficial."
2106,"Recurrent pathogenic variants have been detected in several breast and ovarian 
cancer (BC/OC) risk genes in the Finnish population. We conducted a gene-panel 
sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis to define a more comprehensive 
spectrum of pathogenic variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, BARD1, 
RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1, and FANCM genes in Finnish BC patients. The combined 
frequency of pathogenic variants in the BRCA1/2 genes was 1.8% in 1356 
unselected patients, whereas variants in the other genes were detected 
altogether in 8.3% of 1356 unselected patients and in 12.9% of 699 familial 
patients. CNVs were detected in 0.3% of both 1137 unselected and 612 familial 
patients. A few variants covered most of the pathogenic burden in the studied 
genes. Of the BRCA1/2 carriers, 70.8% had 1 of 10 recurrent variants. In the 
other genes combined, 92.1% of the carrier patients had at least 1 of 11 
recurrent variants. In particular, PALB2 c.1592delT and CHEK2 c.1100delC 
accounted for 88.9% and 82.9%, respectively, of the pathogenic variation in each 
gene. Our results highlight the importance of founder variants in the BC risk 
genes in the Finnish population and could be used in the designing of population 
screening for the risk variants."
2107,"Metastasis of high-grade ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) is orchestrated by soluble 
mediators of the tumor microenvironment. Here, we have used transcriptomic 
profiling to identify lipid-mediated signaling pathways encompassing 41 
ligand-synthesizing enzymes and 23 cognate receptors in tumor, immune and stroma 
cells from HGSC metastases and ascites. Due to its strong association with a 
poor clinical outcome, prostacyclin (PGI2) synthase (PTGIS) is of particular 
interest in this signaling network. PTGIS is highly expressed by 
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), concomitant with elevated PGI2 synthesis, 
whereas tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) exhibit the highest expression of its 
surface receptor (PTGIR). PTGIR activation by PGI2 agonists triggered cAMP 
accumulation and induced a mixed-polarization macrophage phenotype with altered 
inflammatory gene expression, including CXCL10 and IL12A repression, as well as 
reduced phagocytic capability. Co-culture experiments provided further evidence 
for the interaction of CAF with macrophages via PGI2, as the effect of PGI2 
agonists on phagocytosis was mitigated by cyclooxygenase inhibitors. 
Furthermore, conditioned medium from PGI2-agonist-treated TAM promoted tumor 
adhesion to mesothelial cells and migration in a PTGIR-dependent manner, and 
PTGIR activation induced the expression of metastasis-associated and 
pro-angiogenic genes. Taken together, our study identifies a PGI2/PTGIR-driven 
crosstalk between CAF, TAM and tumor cells, promoting immune suppression and a 
pro-metastatic environment."
2108,"The pivotal role of myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) in cancer has 
become increasingly apparent over the past few years. However, to fully 
understand how MDSCs can promote human tumor progression and to develop 
strategies to target this cell type, relevant models that closely resemble the 
clinical complexity of human tumors are needed. Here, we show that mouse MDSCs 
of both the monocytic (M-MDCS) and the granulocytic (PMN-MDSC) lineages are 
recruited to human breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors in mice. 
Transcriptomic analysis of FACS-sorted MDSC-subpopulations from the PDX tumors 
demonstrated the expression of several MDSC genes associated with both their 
mobilization and immunosuppressive function, including S100A8/9, Ptgs2, Stat3, 
and Cxcr2, confirming the functional identity of these cells. By combining FACS 
analysis, RNA sequencing, and immune florescence, we show that the extent and 
type of MDSC infiltration depend on PDX model intrinsic factors such as the 
expression of chemokines involved in mobilizing and recruiting tumor-promoting 
MDSCs. Interestingly, MDSCs have been shown to play a prominent role in breast 
cancer metastasis, and in this context, we demonstrate increased recruitment of 
MDSCs in spontaneous PDX lung metastases compared to the corresponding primary 
PDX tumors. We also demonstrate that T cell-induced inflammation enhances the 
recruitment of MDSC in experimental breast cancer metastases. In conclusion, 
breast cancer PDX models represent a versatile tool for studying molecular 
mechanisms that drive myeloid cell recruitment to primary and metastatic tumors 
and facilitate the development of innovative therapeutic strategies targeting 
these cells."
2109,"In January 2022, our institution launched a comprehensive cancer genome 
profiling program on 10 cancer types using a non-IVD solution named the TruSight 
Oncology 500 Assay provided by Illumina®. The assay analyzes both DNA and RNA, 
identifying Single-Nucleotide Variants (SNV)s and Insertion-Deletion (InDel) in 
523 genes, as well as known and unknown fusions and splicing variants in 55 
genes and Copy Number Alterations (CNVs), Mutational Tumor Burden (MTB) and 
Microsatellite Instability (MSI). According to the current European IVD 
Directive 98/79/EC, an internal validation was performed before running the 
test. A dedicated open-source bioinformatics pipeline was developed for data 
postprocessing, panel assessment and embedding in high-performance computing 
framework using the container technology to ensure scalability and 
reproducibility. Our protocols, applied to 71 DNA and 64 RNA samples, showed 
full agreement between the TruSight Oncology 500 assay and standard approaches, 
with only minor limitations, allowing to routinely perform our protocol in 
patient screening."
2110,"Immunotherapy is an ever-expanding field in lung cancer treatment research. Over 
the past two decades, there has been significant progress in identifying 
immunotherapy targets and creating specific therapeutic agents, leading to a 
major paradigm shift in lung cancer treatment. However, despite the great 
success achieved with programmed death protein 1/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) 
monoclonal antibodies and with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 plus anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte 
antigen 4 (CTLA-4), only a minority of lung cancer patients respond to 
treatment, and of these many subsequently experience disease progression. In 
addition, immune-related adverse events sometimes can be life-threatening, 
especially when anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 are used in combination. All of this 
prompted researchers to identify novel immune checkpoints targets to overcome 
these limitations. Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), T cell immunoglobulin 
(Ig) and Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-Based Inhibitory Motif (ITIM) domain (TIGIT), T 
cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3) are promising 
molecules now under investigation. This review aims to outline the current role 
of immunotherapy in lung cancer and to examine efficacy and future applications 
of the new immune regulating molecules."
2111,"There are a number of genetic syndromes associated with both high cancer risk 
and clinical radiosensitivity. However, the link between these two notions 
remains unknown. Particularly, some cancer syndromes are caused by mutations in 
genes involved in DNA damage signaling and repair. How are the DNA sequence 
errors propagated and amplified to cause cell transformation? Conversely, some 
cancer syndromes are caused by mutations in genes involved in cell cycle 
checkpoint control. How is misrepaired DNA damage produced? Lastly, certain 
genes, considered as tumor suppressors, are not involved in DNA damage signaling 
and repair or in cell cycle checkpoint control. The mechanistic model based on 
radiation-induced nucleoshuttling of the ATM kinase (RIANS), a major actor of 
the response to ionizing radiation, may help in providing a unified explanation 
of the link between cancer proneness and radiosensitivity. In the frame of this 
model, a given protein may ensure its own specific function but may also play 
additional biological role(s) as an ATM phosphorylation substrate in cytoplasm. 
It appears that the mutated proteins that cause the major cancer and 
radiosensitivity syndromes are all ATM phosphorylation substrates, and they 
generally localize in the cytoplasm when mutated. The relevance of the RIANS 
model is discussed by considering different categories of the cancer syndromes."
2112,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), representing 15-20% of all lung cancers, is an 
aggressive malignancy with a distinct natural history, poor prognosis, and 
limited treatment options. We have previously identified Schwann cells (SCs), 
the main glial cells of the peripheral nervous system, in tumor tissues and 
demonstrated that they may support tumor spreading and metastasis formation in 
the in vitro and in vivo models. However, the role of SCs in the progression of 
SCLC has not been investigated. To clarify this issue, the cell proliferation 
assay, the annexin V apoptosis assay, and the transwell migration and invasion 
assay were conducted to elucidate the roles in SCLC of tumor-associated SCs 
(TA-SCs) in the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of SCLC cells 
in vitro, compared to control group. In addition, the animal models to assess SC 
action's effects on SCLC in vivo were also developed. The result confirmed that 
TA-SCs have a well-established and significant role in facilitating SCLC cell 
cancer migration and invasion of SCLC in vitro, and we also observed that SC 
promotes tumor growth of SCLC in vivo and that TA-SCs exhibited an advantage and 
show a repair-like phenotype, which allowed defining them as tumor-associated 
repair SCs (TAR-SCs). Potential molecular mechanisms of pro-tumorigenic activity 
of TAR-SCs were investigated by the screening of differentially expressed genes 
and constructing networks of messenger-, micro-, and long- non-coding RNA 
(mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA) using DMS114 cells, a human SCLC, stimulated with media from 
DMS114-activated SCs, non-stimulated SCs, and appropriate controls. This study 
improves our understanding of how SCs, especially tumor-activated SCs, may 
promote SCLC progression. Our results highlight a new functional phenotype of 
SCs in cancer and bring new insights into the characterization of the nervous 
system-tumor crosstalk."
2113,"The in-frame internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 
(FLT3) gene is an important negative prognostic marker in acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML). FLT3-ITD monitoring is essential for patients at relapse or those 
receiving FLT3-targeted therapies. Fragment analysis (FA) is commonly used to 
detect and quantify FLT3-ITDs; however, detecting low-burden FLT3-ITDs after a 
treatment is challenging. We, therefore, developed a customized, next-generation 
sequencing (NGS)-based FLT3-ITD assay that includes a new ITD-tracing algorithm, 
""SEED"", optimized for measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring. NGS-SEED 
showed an enhanced sensitivity (0.001%) and has a superior performance over 
conventional fragment analysis. We further investigated the prognostic impact of 
MRD analyzed by NGS-SEED in AML patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Our assay showed that the MRD assessed before 
and after HSCT were significantly associated with a risk of relapse and a poor 
overall survival, respectively, in a time-dependent analysis. Thus, this report 
highlighted the prognostic value of serial MRD monitoring using a sensitive 
method in a clinical setting of AML patients with FLT3-ITD."
2114,"Hereditary gastric cancers (HGCs) are supposed to be rare and difficult to 
identify. Nonetheless, many cases of young patients with gastric cancer (GC) 
fulfill the clinical criteria for considering this diagnosis but do not present 
the defined pathogenic mutations necessary to meet a formal diagnosis of HGC. 
Moreover, GC in young people is a challenging medical situation due to the usual 
aggressiveness of such cases and the potential risk for their relatives when 
related to a germline variant. Aiming to identify additional germline 
alterations that might contribute to the early onset of GC, a complete exome 
sequence of blood samples from 95 GC patients under 50 and 94 blood samples from 
non-cancer patients was performed and compared in this study. The number of 
identified germline mutations in GC patients was found to be much higher than 
that from individuals without a cancer diagnosis. Specifically, the number of 
high functional impact mutations, including those affecting genes involved in 
medical diseases, cancer hallmark genes, and DNA replication and repair 
processes, was much higher, strengthening the hypothesis of the potential causal 
role of such mutations in hereditary cancers. Conversely, classically related 
HGC mutations were not found and the number of mutations in genes in the CDH1 
pathway was not found to be relevant among the young GC patients, reinforcing 
the hypothesis that existing alternative germline contributions favor the early 
onset of GC. The LILRB1 gene variants, absent in the world's cancer datasets but 
present in high frequencies among the studied GC patients, may represent 
essential cancer variants specific to the Amerindian ancestry's contributions. 
Identifying non-reported GC variants, potentially originating from under-studied 
populations, may pave the way for additional discoveries and translations to 
clinical interventions for GC management. The newly proposed approaches may 
reduce the discrepancy between clinically suspected and molecularly proven 
hereditary GC and shed light on similar inconsistencies among other cancer 
types. Additionally, the results of this study may support the development of 
new blood tests for evaluating cancer risk that can be used in clinical 
practice, helping physicians make decisions about strategies for surveillance 
and risk-reduction interventions."
2115,"TP53 tumor suppressor gene is a commonly mutated gene in cancer. p53 mediated 
senescence is critical in preventing oncogenesis in normal cells. Since p53 is a 
transcription factor, mutations in its DNA binding domain result in the 
functional loss of p53-mediated cellular pathways. Similarly, nuclear factor 
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is another transcription factor that 
maintains cellular homeostasis by regulating redox and detoxification 
mechanisms. In glioblastoma (GBM), Nrf2-mediated antioxidant activity is 
upregulated while p53-mediated senescence is lost, both rendering GBM cells 
resistant to treatment. To address this, we identified novel Nrf2 inhibitors 
from bioactive compounds using a molecular imaging biosensor-based screening 
approach. We further evaluated the identified compounds for their in vitro and 
in vivo chemotherapy enhancement capabilities in GBM cells carrying different 
p53 mutations. We thus identified an Nrf2 inhibitor that is effective in GBM 
cells carrying the p53 (R175H) mutation, a frequent clinically observed hotspot 
structural mutation responsible for chemotherapeutic resistance in GBM. 
Combining this drug with low-dose chemotherapies can potentially reduce their 
toxicity and increase their efficacy by transiently suppressing Nrf2-mediated 
detoxification function in GBM cells carrying this important p53 missense 
mutation."
2116,"The interaction of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) with their receptor 
(RAGE) elicits oxidative stress and inflammation, which is involved in the 
development of breast cancer. However, large-scale population-based evidence 
exploring genetically modified circulating levels of AGEs-RAGE axis with risk 
and mortality of breast cancer is scarce. We recruited 1051 pairs of age-matched 
breast cancers and controls and measured plasma AGEs and sRAGE concentrations by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Multivariate logistic regression and 
Cox proportional hazard model were used to calculate the effects of plasma 
levels and genetic variants of the AGEs-RAGE axis and their combined effects on 
breast cancer risk and prognosis, respectively. Furthermore, linear regression 
was performed to assess the modifications in plasma AGEs/sRAGE levels by genetic 
predisposition. Higher levels of AGEs and AGEs/sRAGE-ratio were associated with 
an increased risk of breast cancer, but sRAGE levels were negatively associated 
with breast cancer risk, especially in women &lt;60 years. We also observed a 
positive association between AGEs and the bad prognosis of breast cancer. 
Although we did not observe a significant contribution of genetic variants to 
breast cancer risk, rs2070600 and rs1800624 in the AGER gene were 
dose-dependently correlated with sRAGE levels. Further, compared to the 
haplotype CT at the lowest quartile of AGEs, haplotypes TT and TA were 
prominently associated with breast cancer risk in the highest quartile of AGEs. 
This study depicted a significant association between circulating levels of 
AGEs-RAGE axis and breast cancer risk and mortality and revealed the potential 
of plasma AGEs, especially coupled with AGER polymorphism as biomarkers of 
breast cancer."
2117,"Ectopic lymphoid structures termed tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) have an 
immunomodulatory function and positively affect prognosis in certain cancers. 
However, their clinical relevance and prognostic utility in perihilar 
cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA) are unknown. Therefore, determining the involvement 
and prognostic utility of TLSs in pCCA is the aim of this study. Ninety-three 
patients with surgically resected pCCA were included retrospectively. 
Hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining identified and classified 
the TLSs, and multiplex immunofluorescence determined the TLS composition in the 
pCCA sample. The correlations between clinical features and TLSs were analyzed 
using either Fisher's exact test or the Chi-squared test. Recurrence-free 
survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) correlations with TLSs were analyzed 
using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. We identified TLSs in 86% of 
patients with pCCA, including lymphoid aggregates (6.45%), primary (13.98%) and 
secondary follicles (65.59%). Patients with intra-tumoral secondary 
follicle-like TLSs (S-TLSs) had better OS (p = 0.003) and RFS (p = 0.0313). The 
multivariate analysis identified the presence of S-TLSs as a good independent 
prognostic indicator for OS but not for RFS. Interestingly, the presence of 
S-TLS only indicated better 5-year OS in 54 patients without lymph node 
metastasis (LNM-, p = 0.0232) but not in the 39 patients with lymph node 
metastasis (LNM+, p = 0.1244). Intra-tumoral S-TLSs predicted longer OS in 
patients with surgically resected pCCA, suggesting intra-tumoral S-TLSs' 
contribution to effective antitumor immunity and that S-TLSs hold promise for 
diagnostic and therapeutic development in pCCA."
2118,"The development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) are known to be 
affected by the interplay between tumor and immune cells. However, the impact of 
CRC cells on the systemic immunity has yet to be elucidated. We aimed to 
comprehensively evaluate the circulating immune subsets and transcriptional 
profiles of CRC patients. In contrast to healthy controls (HCs), CRC patients 
had a lower percentage of B and T lymphocytes, T helper (Th) cells, 
non-classical monocytes, dendritic cells, and a higher proportion of 
polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells, as well as a reduced 
expression of CD69 on NK cells. Therefore, CRC patients exhibit a more evident 
systemic immune suppression than HCs. A diagnostic model integrating seven 
immune subsets was constructed to distinguish CRC patients from HCs with an AUC 
of 1.000. Moreover, NR3C2, CAMK4, and TRAT1 were identified as candidate genes 
regulating the number of Th cells in CRC patients. The altered composition of 
circulating immune cells in CRC could complement the regional immune status of 
the tumor microenvironment and contribute to the discovery of immune-related 
biomarkers for the diagnosis of CRC."
2119,"SRY-box transcription factor 11 (SOX11), as a member of the SOX family, is a 
transcription factor involved in the regulation of specific biological processes 
and has recently been found to be a prognostic marker for certain cancers. 
However, the roles of SOX11 in cancer remain controversial. Our study aimed to 
explore the various aspects of SOX11 in pan-cancer. The expression of SOX11 was 
investigated by the Genotype Tissue-Expression (GTEX) dataset and the Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The protein level of SOX11 in tumor tissues and 
tumor-adjacent tissues was verified by human pan-cancer tissue microarray. 
Additionally, we used TCGA pan-cancer data to analyze the correlations among 
SOX11 expression and survival outcomes, clinical features, stemness, 
microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutation burden (TMB), mismatch repair 
(MMR) related genes and the tumor immune microenvironment. Furthermore, the 
cBioPortal database was applied to investigate the gene alterations of SOX11. 
The main biological processes of SOX11 in cancers were analyzed by Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). As a result, aberrant expression of SOX11 has been 
implicated in 27 kinds of cancer types. Aberrant SOX11 expression was closely 
associated with survival outcomes, stage, tumor recurrence, MSI, TMB and 
MMR-related genes. In addition, the most frequent alteration of the SOX11 genome 
was mutation. Our study also showed the correlations of SOX11 with the level of 
immune infiltration in various cancers. In summary, our findings underline the 
multifaceted role and prognostic value of SOX11 in pan-cancer."
2120,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may drive the escape of 
ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors from ALK-tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We investigated whether first-generation ALK-TKI 
therapy-induced EMT promotes cross-resistance to new-generation ALK-TKIs and 
whether this could be circumvented by the flavonolignan silibinin, an EMT 
inhibitor. ALK-rearranged NSCLC cells acquiring a bona fide EMT phenotype upon 
chronic exposure to the first-generation ALK-TKI crizotinib exhibited increased 
resistance to second-generation brigatinib and were fully refractory to 
third-generation lorlatinib. Such cross-resistance to new-generation ALK-TKIs, 
which was partially recapitulated upon chronic TGFβ stimulation, was less 
pronounced in ALK-rearranged NSCLC cells solely acquiring a partial/hybrid E/M 
transition state. Silibinin overcame EMT-induced resistance to brigatinib and 
lorlatinib and restored their efficacy involving the transforming growth 
factor-beta (TGFβ)/SMAD signaling pathway. Silibinin deactivated TGFβ-regulated 
SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and suppressed the transcriptional activation of genes 
under the control of SMAD binding elements. Computational modeling studies and 
kinase binding assays predicted a targeted inhibitory binding of silibinin to 
the ATP-binding pocket of TGFβ type-1 receptor 1 (TGFBR1) and TGFBR2 but solely 
at the two-digit micromolar range. A secretome profiling confirmed the ability 
of silibinin to normalize the augmented release of TGFβ into the extracellular 
fluid of ALK-TKIs-resistant NSCLC cells and reduce constitutive and inducible 
SMAD2/3 phosphorylation occurring in the presence of ALK-TKIs. In summary, the 
ab initio plasticity along the EMT spectrum may explain the propensity of 
ALK-rearranged NSCLC cells to acquire resistance to new-generation ALK-TKIs, a 
phenomenon that could be abrogated by the silibinin-driven attenuation of the 
TGFβ/SMAD signaling axis in mesenchymal ALK-rearranged NSCLC cells."
2121,"Objectives: Smoking is the commonest cause of oral cavity squamous cell 
carcinoma (OC-SCC), but the etiology of OC-SCC in nonsmokers is unknown. Our 
primary goal was to use metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) to define the 
taxonomic composition and functional potential of oral metagenome in nonsmokers 
with OC-SCC. Methods: We conducted a case-control study with 42 OC-SCC case and 
45 control nonsmokers. MSS was performed on DNA extracted from mouthwash 
samples. Taxonomic analysis and pathway analysis were done using MetaPhlAn2 and 
HUMAnN2, respectively. Statistical difference was determined using the 
Mann-Whitney test controlling false discovery rate. Results: There was no 
significant difference in age, sex, race, or alcohol consumption between OC-SCC 
and control patients. There was a significant difference in beta diversity 
between OC-SCC and controls. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes and 
Synergistetes were overly represented in OC-SCC while Actinobacteria and 
Firmicutes were overly represented in controls. At the genus level, 
Fusobacterium was overly represented in OC-SCC compared with controls, while 
Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Cryptobacterium, and Selenomonas 
were overly represented in controls. Bacterial pathway analysis identified 
overrepresentation in OC-SCC of pathways related to metabolism of flavin, 
biotin, thiamin, heme, sugars, fatty acids, peptidoglycans, and tRNA and 
overrepresentation of nucleotides and essential amino acids in controls. 
Conclusions: The oral microbiome in nonsmoker patients with OC-SCC is 
significantly different from that of nonsmoker control patients in taxonomic 
compositions and functional potentials. Our study's MSS findings matched with 
previous 16S-based methods in taxonomic differentiation but varied greatly in 
functional differentiation of microbiomes in OC-SCC and controls."
2122,"The risk of malignancy (ROM) of EIF1AX-mutated thyroid nodules has been 
theorized to be contingent on the position of the mutation within the gene and 
the presence of co-existing mutations. However, due to EIF1AX's low mutation 
frequency, sample sizes currently reported in the literature are too diminutive 
to appraise the clinical utility of molecular diagnostic testing. The objective 
of this study was to elucidate prognostic indicators of EIF1AX-mutated thyroid 
tumors and cancer aggressiveness by examining a large cohort of cytologically 
indeterminate thyroid nodules (CITNs) that underwent molecular testing and 
subsequent surgical resection. This is a multicenter study involving 764 
subtotal and total thyroidectomy patients that underwent preoperative molecular 
testing at two quaternary care hospitals. A five-year retrospective review was 
performed on the 42 charts of patients that opted for surgery following a 
positive EIF1AX mutation on ThyroseqV3 results from January 2018 to May 2022. 
Patient demographics, cytopathology results, molecular testing results, and 
postoperative histopathology were reviewed. Of the 42 surgically resected 
nodules that harbored an EIF1AX mutation, 16 (38.1%) were benign, six (14.3%) 
were non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasms with papillary-like nuclear 
features (NIFTPs) or well-differentiated thyroid neoplasms of uncertain 
malignant potential (WDT-UMPs), and 20 (47.6%) were malignant. An isolated 
EIF1AX mutation conferred a ROM of 47.6%, whereas the ROM for nodules with at 
least one additional molecular alteration was 72.7%. The ROM increased to 100% 
for nodules with at least one additional molecular alteration and the 
A113_splice site mutation. Six malignant nodules were aggressive, with five 
having variegated components of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC). 
EIF1AX-mutated thyroid nodules are more susceptible to malignancy in the 
presence of the A113_splice site mutation and when co-mutated with RAS and/or 
TP53. This deleterious amalgam is associated with aggressive disease and renders 
these nodules PDTC. A preoperative molecular test finding of an EIF1AX mutation 
can be a useful tool for thyroid specialists to optimize clinical management."

2124,"Despite improvements in preventative strategies, such as regular screenings with 
Pap tests and human papillomavirus (HPV) tests as well as HPV vaccinations, 
effective treatment for advanced cervical cancer remains poor. Deregulation of 
STAT3 is an oncogenic factor that promotes tumorigenesis and 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in various cancers. Oncostatin M 
(OSM), a pleiotropic cytokine, induces STAT3 activation, exacerbating cervical 
cancer. However, the mechanism by which the OSM-STAT3 axis epigenetically 
regulates tumor-progression-related genes in cervical cancer is not well 
understood. Here, we show that OSM-mediated STAT3 activation promotes 
pro-tumorigenic gene expression programs, with chromatin remodeling in cervical 
cancer. Reanalysis of scRNA-seq data performed in cervical cancer uncovered an 
interaction between the oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) on tumor cells and OSM 
induced by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Our gene expression profiling 
(bulk RNA-seq) shows that OSM-induced genes were involved in hypoxia, wound 
healing, and angiogenesis, which were significantly inhibited by SD-36, a 
STAT3-selective degrader. Additionally, ATAC-seq experiments revealed that STAT3 
binding motifs were preferentially enriched in open chromatin regions of the 
OSM-STAT3-regulated genes. Among the 50 candidate genes that were regulated 
epigenetically through the OSM-STAT3 axis, we found that the expression levels 
of NDRG1, HK2, PLOD2, and NPC1 were significantly correlated with those of OSMR 
and STAT3 in three independent cervical cancer cohorts. Also, higher expression 
levels of these genes are significantly associated with poor prognosis in 
cervical cancer patients. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the 
OSM-STAT3 signaling pathway regulates crucial transcriptomic programs through 
epigenetic changes and that selective inhibition of STAT3 may be a novel 
therapeutic strategy for patients with advanced cervical cancer."
2125,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused by platinum drugs are dangerous lesions 
that kill cancer cells in chemotherapy. Repair of DSB by homologous 
recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is frequently associated 
with platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. While the role of the HR pathway and 
HR-targeting strategy in platinum resistance is well studied, dissecting and 
targeting NHEJ machinery to overcome platinum resistance in ovarian cancer 
remain largely unexplored. Here, through an NHEJ pathway-focused gene RNAi 
screen, we found that the knockdown of XRCC4 significantly sensitized cisplatin 
treatment in the platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Moreover, 
upregulation of XRCC4 is observed in a panel of platinum-resistant cell lines 
relative to the parental cell lines, as well as in ovarian cancer patients with 
poor progression-free survival. Mechanistically, the increased sensitivity to 
cisplatin upon XRCC4 knockdown was caused by accumulated DNA damage. In 
cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer, the JNK-cJUN complex, activated by 
cisplatin, translocated into the nucleus and promoted the transcription of XRCC4 
to confer cisplatin resistance. Knockdown of XRCC4 or treatment of the JNK 
inhibitor led to the attenuation of cisplatin-resistant tumor growth in the 
xenograft mouse models. These data suggest targeting XRCC4 is a potential 
strategy for ovarian cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer."
2126,"Many patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are still dying from this 
disease. In the past, the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) has been 
investigated for AML and found to be partially effective; however, the presence 
of O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT; a DNA repair enzyme) in tumor 
cells confers profound treatment resistance against TMZ. We are developing a 
novel anticancer compound, called NEO212, where TMZ was covalently conjugated to 
perillyl alcohol (a naturally occurring monoterpene). NEO212 has revealed robust 
therapeutic activity in a variety of preclinical cancer models, including AML. 
In the current study, we investigated its impact on a panel of human AML cell 
lines and found that it exerted cytotoxic potency even against MGMT-positive 
cells that were highly resistant to TMZ. Furthermore, NEO212 strongly stimulated 
the expression of a large number of macrophage-associated marker genes, 
including CD11b/ITGAM. This latter effect could not be mimicked when cells were 
treated with TMZ or an equimolar mix of individual agents, TMZ plus perillyl 
alcohol. The superior cytotoxic impact of NEO212 appeared to involve 
down-regulation of MGMT protein levels. In a mouse model implanted with 
TMZ-resistant, MGMT-positive AML cells, two 5-day cycles of 25 mg/kg NEO212 
achieved an apparent cure, as mice survived &gt;300 days without any signs of 
disease. In parallel toxicity studies with rats, a 5-day cycle of 200 mg/kg 
NEO212 was well tolerated by these animals, whereas animals that were given 200 
mg/kg TMZ all died due to severe leukopenia. Together, our results show that 
NEO212 exerts pleiotropic effects on AML cells that include differentiation, 
proliferation arrest, and eventual cell death. In vivo, NEO212 was well 
tolerated even at dosages that far exceed the therapeutic need, indicating a 
large therapeutic window. These results present NEO212 as an agent that should 
be considered for development as a therapeutic agent for AML."
2127,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatoblastoma (HBL), a deadly malignancy in children, is 
the most common type of pediatric liver cancer. We recently demonstrated that 
β-catenin, phosphorylated at S675 (ph-S675-β-catenin), causes pathological 
alterations in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC), by activating 
oncogenes and fibrotic genes via human genomic regions, known as 
cancer-enhancing genomic regions or aggressive liver cancer domains 
(CEGRs/ALCDs). The aim of this study was to determine the role of the 
ph-S675-β-catenin-TCF4-CEGRs/ALCDs pathway in HBL.
METHODS: The ph-S675-β-catenin-TCF4-CEGRs/ALCDs pathway was examined in a large 
cohort of HBL specimens, in HBL cell lines HepG2 and Huh6, and in 
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs).
RESULTS: β-catenin is phosphorylated at S675 in a large portion of tested HBL 
patients. In these patients, ph-S675-β-catenin forms complexes with TCF4 and 
opens CEGRs/ALCDs-dependent oncogenes for transcription, leading to a massive 
overexpression of the oncogenes. The inhibition of the 
β-catenin-TCF4-CEGRs/ALCDs axis inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells and 
tumor growth in HBL cell lines and HBL-PDXs. The ph-S675-β-catenin is abundant 
in mitotic cells. We found that markers of HBL Glypican 3 (GPC3) and Alpha 
Fetoprotein (AFP) are increased in HBL patients by β-catenin-TCF4-p300 
complexes.
CONCLUSIONS: The phosphorylation-mediated activation of the 
β-catenin-TCF4-p300-CEGRs/ALCDs pathway increases oncogene expression in 
patients with aggressive liver cancer and promotes the development of 
hepatoblastoma."
2128,"BACKGROUND: Abnormal N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification caused by m6A 
regulators is a common characteristic in various tumors. However, little is 
known about the role of m6A regulator AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) in triple-negative 
breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, we analyzed the influence of ALKBH5 on the 
stemness of TNBC and the molecular mechanism using bioinformatics analysis and 
in vivo animal experiments.
METHODS: RNA expression data and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data 
were downloaded from the TCGA and GEO databases. Following intersection 
analysis, key genes involved in the TNBC cell stemness were determined, which 
was followed by functional enrichment analysis, PPI and survival analysis. 
Exosomes were extracted from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC-Exos) 
where ALKBH5 inhibition assay was conducted to verify their function in the 
biological characteristics of TNBC cells.
RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed 45 key genes of ALKBH5 regulating TNBC 
cell stemness. In addition, UBE2C was predicted as a key downstream gene and p53 
was predicted as a downstream signaling of ALKBH5. In vivo data confirmed that 
ALKBH5 upregulated UBE2C expression by regulating the m6A modification of UBE2C 
and reduced p53 expression, thus promoting the stemness, growth and metastasis 
of TNBC cells. BMSC-Exos suppressed the tumor stemness, growth and metastasis of 
TNBC cells and ALKBH5 shRNA-loaded BMSC-Exos showed a more significant 
suppressive role.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings indicated that ALKBH5 shRNA-loaded 
BMSC-Exos reduced TNBC cell stemness, growth and metastasis and define a 
promising strategy to treat TNBC."
2129,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a key transcription factor that regulates 
the transcription of many genes that are responsible for the adaptation and 
survival of tumor cells in hypoxic environments. Over the past few decades, 
tremendous efforts have been made to comprehensively understand the role of 
HIF-1 in tumor progression. Based on the pivotal roles of HIF-1 in tumor 
biology, many HIF-1 inhibitors interrupting expression, stabilization, DNA 
binding properties, or transcriptional activity have been identified as 
potential therapeutic agents for various cancers, yet none of these inhibitors 
have yet been successfully translated into clinically available cancer 
treatments. In this review, we briefly introduce the regulation of the HIF-1 
pathway and summarize its roles in tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and 
metastasis. In addition, we explore the implications of HIF-1 in the development 
of drug resistance and cancer-related pain: the most commonly encountered 
obstacles during conventional anticancer therapies. Finally, the current status 
of HIF-1 inhibitors in clinical trials and their perspectives are highlighted, 
along with their modes of action. This review provides new insights into novel 
anticancer drug development targeting HIF-1. HIF-1 inhibitors may be promising 
combinational therapeutic interventions to improve the efficacy of current 
cancer treatments and reduce drug resistance and cancer-related pain."
2130,"Neuroblastoma (NBL) and medulloblastoma (MB) are aggressive pediatric cancers 
which can benefit from therapies targeting gangliosides. Therefore, we compared 
the ganglioside profile of 9 MB and 14 NBL samples by thin layer chromatography 
and mass spectrometry. NBL had the highest expression of GD2 (median 0.54 nmol 
GD2/mg protein), and also expressed complex gangliosides. GD2-low samples 
expressed GD1a and were more differentiated. MB mainly expressed GD2 (median 
0.032 nmol GD2/mg protein) or GM3. Four sonic hedgehog-activated (SHH) as well 
as one group 4 and one group 3 MBs were GD2-positive. Two group 3 MB samples 
were GD2-negative but GM3-positive. N-glycolyl neuraminic acid-containing GM3 
was neither detected in NBL nor MB by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, a 
GD2-phenotype predicting two-gene signature (ST8SIA1 and B4GALNT1) was applied 
to RNA-Seq datasets, including 86 MBs and validated by qRT-PCR. The signature 
values were decreased in group 3 and wingless-activated (WNT) compared to SHH 
and group 4 MBs. These results suggest that while NBL is GD2-positive, only some 
MB patients can benefit from a GD2-directed therapy. The expression of genes 
involved in the ganglioside synthesis may allow the identification of 
GD2-positive MBs. Finally, the ganglioside profile may reflect the 
differentiation status in NBL and could help to define MB subtypes."
2131,"The oncogenic transcription factor ZNF217 orchestrates several molecular 
signaling networks to reprogram integrated circuits governing hallmark 
capabilities within cancer cells. High levels of ZNF217 expression provide 
advantages to a specific subset of cancer cells to reprogram tumor progression, 
drug resistance and cancer cell plasticity. ZNF217 expression level, thus, 
provides a powerful biomarker of poor prognosis and a predictive biomarker for 
anticancer therapies. Cancer epigenetic mechanisms are well known to support the 
acquisition of hallmark characteristics during oncogenesis. However, the complex 
interactions between ZNF217 and epigenetic processes have been poorly 
appreciated. Deregulated DNA methylation status at ZNF217 locus or an intricate 
cross-talk between ZNF217 and noncoding RNA networks could explain aberrant 
ZNF217 expression levels in a cancer cell context. On the other hand, the ZNF217 
protein controls gene expression signatures and molecular signaling for tumor 
progression by tuning DNA methylation status at key promoters by interfering 
with noncoding RNAs or by refining the epitranscriptome. Altogether, this review 
focuses on the recent advances in the understanding of ZNF217 collaboration with 
epigenetics processes to orchestrate oncogenesis. We also discuss the exciting 
burgeoning translational medicine and candidate therapeutic strategies emerging 
from those recent findings connecting ZNF217 to epigenetic deregulation in 
cancer."
2132,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators in various biological 
processes involved in the hallmarks of cancer. Maternally expressed gene 3 
(MEG3) is lncRNA that regulates target genes through transcription, translation, 
post-translational modification, and epigenetic regulation. MEG3 has been known 
as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation could be found in various cancers. 
Furthermore, clinical studies revealed that impaired MEG3 expression is 
associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance. MEG3 exerts its tumor 
suppressive effect by suppressing various cancer hallmarks and preventing cells 
from acquiring cancer-specific characteristics; as it could suppress tumor cells 
proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis; it also could promote 
tumor cell death and regulate tumor cell metabolic reprogramming. Hence, MEG3 is 
a potential prognostic marker, and overexpressing MEG3 might become a potential 
antitumor therapeutic strategy. Herein, we summarize recent knowledge regarding 
the role of MEG3 in regulating tumor hallmarks as well as the underlying 
molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, we also discuss the clinical importance of 
MEG3, as well as their potential in tumor prognosis and antitumor therapeutic 
strategies."
2133,"SETD7 is a lysine N-methyltransferase that targets many proteins important in 
breast cancer (BC). However, its role and clinical significance remain unclear. 
Here, we used online tools and multiple public datasets to explore the 
predictive potential of SETD7 expression (high or low quartile) considering BC 
subtype, grade, stage, and therapy. We also investigated overrepresented 
biological processes associated with its expression using TCGA-BRCA data. SETD7 
expression was highest in the Her2 (ERBB2)-enriched molecular subtype and lowest 
in the basal-like subtype. For the basal-like subtype specifically, higher SETD7 
was consistently correlated with worse recurrence-free survival (p &lt; 0.009). 
High SETD7-expressing tumours further exhibited a higher rate of ERBB2 mutation 
(20% vs. 5%) along with a poorer response to anti-Her2 therapy. Overall, high 
SETD7-expressing tumours showed higher stromal and lower immune scores. This was 
specifically related to higher counts of cancer-associated fibroblasts and 
endothelial cells, but lower B and T cell signatures, especially in the luminal 
A subtype. Genes significantly associated with SETD7 expression were accordingly 
overrepresented in immune response processes, with distinct subtype 
characteristics. We conclude that the prognostic value of SETD7 depends on the 
BC subtype and that SETD7 may be further explored as a potential 
treatment-predictive marker for immune checkpoint inhibitors."
2134,"Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the world and seriously affects 
the quality of life of patients. The diagnostic techniques for tumors mainly 
include tumor biomarker detection, instrumental examination, and tissue biopsy. 
In recent years, liquid technology represented by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) 
has gradually replaced traditional technology with its advantages of being 
non-invasive and accurate, its high specificity, and its high sensitivity. ctDNA 
may carry throughout the circulatory system through tumor cell necrosis, 
apoptosis, circulating exosome secretion, etc., carrying the characteristic 
changes in tumors, such as mutation, methylation, microsatellite instability, 
gene rearrangement, etc. In this paper, ctDNA mutation and methylation, as the 
objects to describe the preparation process before ctDNA analysis, and the 
detection methods of two gene-level changes, including a series of enrichment 
detection techniques derived from PCR, sequencing-based detection techniques, 
and comprehensive detection techniques, are combined with new materials. In 
addition, the role of ctDNA in various stages of cancer development is 
summarized, such as early screening, diagnosis, molecular typing, prognosis 
prediction, recurrence monitoring, and drug guidance. In summary, ctDNA is an 
ideal biomarker involved in the whole process of tumor development."
2135,"ESCC is a highly malignant tumor, and its morbidity and mortality in China 
account for more than 50% of the world's total rates. As effective treatments 
are lacking, the 5-year survival rate of patients does not exceed 30%. 
CAR-T-cell-based immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most promising cancer 
treatments; however, there are relatively fewer reports regarding its 
application for ESCC. In this study, we conducted large-sample whole-genome 
sequencing (WGS) and RNA-seq analysis of patients with ESCC from China to 
examine the feasibility of EGFR-targeting CAR-T cells in the treatment of ESCC. 
We found much higher levels of EGFR gene amplification and overexpression in 
tumors than in the normal tissues, indicating that EGFR could be a promising 
target of CAR-T-cell-based immunotherapy in ESCC. Therefore, we tested 
EGFR-targeting CAR-T cells for lytic activity against ESCC cells as a model to 
establish cellular immunotherapy for ESCC. Five types of CAR-T cells targeting 
EGFR were constructed, two of which, CAR1-T and CAR2-T, showed a strong 
cytotoxicity against ESCC in in vitro and in vivo experiments. The results of 
this study suggest that CAR1-T and CAR2-T have the potential to be used for 
anti-ESCC immunotherapy in clinics."
2136,"PatAB is an ABC bacterial transporter that facilitates the export of antibiotics 
and dyes. The overexpression of patAB genes conferring efflux-mediated 
fluoroquinolone resistance has been observed in several laboratory strains and 
clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Using transformation and 
whole-genome sequencing, we characterized the fluoroquinolone-resistance 
mechanism of one S. pneumoniae clinical isolate without mutations in the DNA 
topoisomerase genes. We identified the PatAB fluoroquinolone efflux-pump as the 
mechanism conferring a low-level resistance to ciprofloxacin (8 µg/mL) and 
levofloxacin (4 µg/mL). Genetic transformation experiments with different 
amplimers revealed that the entire patA plus the 5'-terminus of patB are 
required for levofloxacin-efflux. By contrast, only the upstream region of the 
patAB operon, plus the region coding the N-terminus of PatA containing the G39D, 
T43A, V48A and D100N amino acid changes, are sufficient to confer a 
ciprofloxacin-efflux phenotype, thus suggesting differences between 
fluoroquinolones in their binding and/or translocation pathways. In addition, we 
identified a novel single mutation responsible for the constitutive and 
ciprofloxacin-inducible upregulation of patAB. This mutation is predicted to 
destabilize the putative rho-independent transcriptional terminator located 
upstream of patA, increasing transcription of downstream genes. This is the 
first report demonstrating the role of the PatAB transporter in 
levofloxacin-efflux in a pneumoccocal clinical isolate."
2137,"This study aimed to characterize a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain (KP411) 
recovered from the stool samples of poultry (Gallus gallus) in the Brazilian 
Amazon Region. The whole-genome sequencing of KP411 revealed the presence of an 
important arsenal of antimicrobial resistance genes to β-lactams (blaCTX-M-14, 
blaTEM-1B, blaKPC-2, blaSVH-11), aminoglycosides [aph(3″)- Ib, aph(6)-Id, 
aph(3')-Ia], sulfonamides (sul1, sul2), quinolones (oqxAB), fosfomycin (fosAKP), 
and macrolides [mph(A)]. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that the KP411 
strain belongs to the ST258 clonal lineage, which is one of the main epidemic 
clones responsible for the dissemination of KPC-2 worldwide. Our data suggest 
that food-producing animals may act as reservoirs of multidrug-resistant K. 
pneumoniae belonging to the ST258 clone, and, consequently, contribute to their 
dissemination to humans and the environment."
2138,"Antibiotic usage and yogurt consumption are the major interventions for gut 
microbiota, yet their shared characteristics and disparities in healthy human 
gut microbiome remain unclear. This study aimed to decipher the composition 
changes among healthy humans, comparing antibiotic usage and yogurt consumption. 
The relative bacterial abundances of 1113 fecal samples were collected from an 
ongoing, population-based longitudinal cohort study in China that covered 
lifestyle, diet, disease status and physical measurements, and biological 
indicators of participants were obtained by the sequencing of 16S rRNA. The 
samples were divided into three groups, which were antibiotic users (122), 
yogurt consumers (497) and controls (494), where data visualization, alpha 
diversity, beta diversity and LEfSe analysis were conducted. At the family 
level, the relative abundances of Streptococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and 
Enterococcaceae families in antibiotic users increased almost 50%, 70% and 200%, 
respectively, while yogurt consumption also increased relative abundances of 
Streptococcaceae and Enterococcaceae, but not Enterobacteriaceae. Alpha 
diversity analyses suggested that the microbiome of the antibiotic usage and 
yogurt consumption groups exhibited an alpha diversity lower than that of the 
control. LEfSe analysis showed that, at the family level, the number of 
biomarkers in the yogurt consumption and antibiotic usage group were 
respectively 5 and 7, lower than that of the control (13). This study 
demonstrated the importance in considering the potential assistance of yogurt 
consumption on ARG gene transfer from commensal bacteria to pathogens in the 
human gut, which may pose a risk for human health. Antibiotic usage and yogurt 
consumption share more identical changes on healthy human gut flora than 
disparities. Therefore, in order to understand the potential risks of antibiotic 
usage and yogurt consumption on antibiotic resistance transmission in human gut 
microbiota, further research needs to be undertaken."
2139,"Escherichia coli infections (including APEC) in broiler chickens are not only a 
health and economic problem of the flock, but also a significant health threat 
to poultry meat consumers. The prophylactic and therapeutic effects of the 
phytobiotic composition on E. coli in broiler chickens were previously 
described. However, most of the data were related to the reference strains (for 
both in vitro and in vivo models). Based on the previous studies in human and 
animals, E. coli strains seem to be multidrug resistance. This, in turn, makes 
it necessary to develop effective alternative methods of treating this type of 
infection already at the stage of poultry production. In the present study, the 
antibacterial activity against various strains of E. coli (including APEC) was 
assessed for two innovative phytobiotics mixtures: H1, containing thymol, 
menthol, linalool, trans-anethole, methyl salicylate, 1,8-cineol, and p-cymene; 
H2, in addition to compounds from H1, containing terpinen-4-ol and γ-terpinene. 
The unique mixtures of phytobiotics used in the experiment were effective 
against various strains of E. coli, also against APEC, isolated from broiler 
chickens from traditional industrial breeding, as well as against those showing 
colistin resistance. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for these 
unique mixtures were: For H1 1:512 for APEC and non-APEC E. coli strains 
isolated from day old chicks (DOCs), 1:512 for non-APEC, and 1:1024 for non-APEC 
isolated from broilers sample. For mixture H2, MIC for APEC from both type of 
samples (DOCs and broilers) was 1:1024 and for non-APEC (DOCs and broilers) was 
1:512. The results suggest that phytobiotic compositions used in this study can 
be successfully used as a natural alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of 
E. coli infections in broiler chickens. The promising results may be a crucial 
point for further analyses in broiler flocks exposed to E. coli infections and 
where it is necessary to reduce the level of antibiotics or completely eliminate 
them, thus reducing the risk of foodborne infections."
2140,"Klebsiella pneumoniae has been among the main pathogens contributing to the 
burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the last decade, and K. pneumoniae 
AMR strains predominantly cluster in the ST258 clonal complex. However, ST307 is 
emerging as an important high-risk clone. In Central America, there have been 
few studies on the molecular epidemiology of the K. pneumoniae strains involved 
in infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an epidemiological study in three reference 
hospitals in the central region of Panama, using isolates of K. pneumoniae 
involved in infections, and identifying their AMR profile, associated clinical 
risk factors, and molecular typing using a multilocus sequence typing (ST) 
scheme.
RESULTS: Six STs were detected: 307 (55%), 152, 18, 29, 405, and 207. CTX-M-15- 
and TEM-type beta-lactamases were identified in 100% of ESBL-producing strains; 
substitutions in gyrA Ser83Ile and parC Ser80Ile were identified in all ST307s; 
and in ST152 gyrA Ser83Phe, Asp87Ala, and parC Ser80Ile, the qnrB gene was 
detected in all strains resistant to ciprofloxacin.
CONCLUSIONS: We present the first report on ST307 in three reference hospitals 
in the central region of Panama, which is a high-risk emerging clone and 
represents a public health alert for potential difficulties in managing K. 
pneumoniae infections in Panama, and which may extend to other Central American 
countries."
2141,"Antimicrobial resistance is a global threat that is spreading more and more in 
both human and animal niches. This study investigates the antimicrobial 
resistance and virulence threats of Escherichia coli isolates recovered from 
intestinal and fecal samples of 100 chickens, 60 turkeys, and 30 sparrows. 
Extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli isolates were recovered 
in 12 of the animals tested, selecting one isolate per positive animal: sparrow 
(eight isolates, 26.7%), turkey (three isolates, 5%), and chicken (one isolate, 
1%). The E. coli isolates were ascribed to B1 and D phylogenetic groups. The 
blaCTX-M-14 gene was detected in all ESBL-producing E. coli isolates from 
sparrow. The blaCTX-M-15 (two isolates) and blaCTX-M-14 genes (one isolate) were 
detected in the isolates of turkey, and the blaCTX-M-1 gene in one isolate from 
broiler. Three lineages were revealed among the tested isolates (ST/phylogenetic 
group/type of ESBL/origin): ST117/D/CTX-M-1/broiler, ST4492 
(CC405)/D/CTX-M-15/turkey, and ST602/B1/CTX-M-14/sparrow. All isolates were 
negative for stx1, sxt2, and eae virulence genes. Our findings provide evidence 
that the sparrow could be a vector in the dissemination of ESBL-producing E. 
coli isolates to other environments. This study also reports, to our knowledge, 
the first detection of blaCTX-M-14 from sparrow at a global level and in turkey 
in Algeria."
2142,"Resistance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus&amp;nbsp;aureus (MRSA) from 
food and livestock to last resort antibiotics such as linezolid is highly 
concerning, since treatment options for infections in humans might be 
diminished. Known mechanisms of linezolid resistance include point mutations in 
the 23S rRNA gene and in the ribosomal proteins L3, L4 and L22 as well as an 
acquisition of the cfr, optrA or poxtA gene. The objective of our study was to 
characterize antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants and phylogenetic 
relationships among linezolid-resistant (LR-) MRSA from food and livestock. In 
total, from more than 4000 incoming isolates in the years 2012 to 2021, only two 
strains from 2015 originating from pig samples exhibited linezolid resistance in 
the antimicrobial susceptibility testing with MICs of ≥8 mg/L. These LR-MRSA 
were characterized in detail by whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic 
analyses using cgMLST. The LR-MRSA strains showed resistances to ten and eight 
different antibiotics, respectively. Both strains harbored plasmid-coded cfr 
genes mediating the linezolid resistance. The cfr genes showed identical 
sequences in both strains. In addition to the cfr gene, genes for phenicol and 
clindamycin resistance were detected on the respective plasmids, opening the 
possibility for a co-selection. The LR-MRSA differed distantly in the 
phylogenetic analyses and also to other MRSA from pig samples in the year 2015. 
In conclusion, the occurrence of LR-MRSA in food and livestock seems to be very 
rare in Germany. However, carriage of plasmids with linezolid resistance 
determinants could lead to further linezolid-resistant strains by horizontal 
gene transfer."
2143,"Antibiotic-resistant strains are a global health-threatening problem. 
Drug-resistant microbes have compromised the control of infectious diseases. 
Therefore, the search for a novel class of antibiotic drugs is necessary. 
Streptomycetes have been described as the richest source of bioactive compounds, 
including antibiotics. This study was aimed to characterize the antibacterial 
compounds of Streptomyces sp. PJ85 isolated from dry dipterocarp forest soil in 
Northeast Thailand. The 16S rRNA gene sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed 
that PJ85 possessed a high similarity to Streptomyces actinomycinicus RCU-197T 
of 98.90%. The PJ85 strain was shown to produce antibacterial compounds that 
were active against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The active compounds of PJ85 were extracted and 
purified using silica gel column chromatography. Two active antibacterial 
compounds, compound 1 and compound PJ85_F39, were purified and characterized 
with spectroscopy, including liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS). Compound 1 was identified as actinomycin D, and compound PJ85_F39 was 
identified as dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA). To the best of our knowledge, this 
is the first report of the purification and characterization of the 
antibacterial compounds of S. actinomycinicus."

This is stored at 5 °C with antibiotic supplementation to avoid bacteriospermia. 
There are many negative consequences on sperm quality and functionality as a 
result of bacterial contamination, as well as on the health of the sow. 
Nowadays, various techniques are being developed to reduce the indiscriminate 
use of antibiotics and thus avoid the generation of antibiotic resistance genes. 
This review aims to inform about the bacterial contamination consequences of 
storing liquid semen from boar and to provide an update on current methods and 
alternatives to antibiotic use in cold storage."
2145,"In recent decades, the appearance of a group of strains resistant to most 
β-lactam antibiotics, called extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), has greatly 
impacted the public health sector. The present work aimed to identify the 
prevalence of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli strains in retail meat from 
northeast Tamaulipas. A total of 228 meat samples were obtained from 76 
different stores. A prevalence of E. coli ESBL of 6.5% (15/228) was detected. 
All (15/15) of the ESBL strains were multiresistant. Altogether, 40% (6/15) of 
the strains showed the presence of class 1 integrons. The isolates identified 
with blaCTX-M (20%) also showed co-resistance with the tet (A and B), str (A and 
B), and sul (2 and 3) genes. A total of 20% of the strains belonged to the B2 
and D phylogroups, which are considered pathogenic groups. None of the 
ESBL-positive strains contained any of the virulence gene factors tested. The 
presence of ESBL-producing E. coli strains in meat indicates a potential risk to 
the consumer. Although most of these strains were classified as commensals, they 
were found to serve as reservoirs of multiresistance to antimicrobials and, 
therefore, are potential routes of dispersion of this resistance to other 
bacteria."
2146,"The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) has been 
increasing since the year 2000 and is considered a serious public health threat 
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Limited studies 
have genotyped Carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli using whole genome 
sequencing to characterize the most common lineages and resistance and virulence 
genes. The aim of this study was to characterize sequence data from 
carbapenem-resistant E. coli isolates (n = 82) collected longitudinally by the 
Alameda County Public Health Laboratory (ACPHL) between 2017 and 2019. E. coli 
genomes were screened for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and extraintestinal 
pathogenic E. coli virulence factor genes (VFGs). The carbapenem-resistant E. 
coli lineages were diverse, with 24 distinct sequence types (STs) represented, 
including clinically important STs: ST131, ST69, ST95, and ST73. All Ambler 
classes of Carbapenemases were present, with NDM-5 being most the frequently 
detected. Nearly all isolates (90%) contained genes encoding resistance to 
third-generation cephalosporins; blaCTX-M genes were most common. The number of 
virulence genes present within pandemic STs was significantly higher than the 
number in non-pandemic lineages (p = 0.035). Virulence genes fimA (92%), trat 
(71%), kpsM (54%), and iutA (46%) were the most prevalent within the isolates. 
Considering the public health risk associated with CRE, these data enhance our 
understanding of the diversity of clinically important E. coli that are 
circulating in Alameda County, California."
2147,"Bacterial drug resistance to antibiotics is growing globally at unprecedented 
levels, and strategies to overcome treatment deficiencies are continuously 
developing. In our approach, we utilized metal nanoparticles, silver 
nanoparticles (AgNPs), known for their wide spread and significant 
anti-bacterial actions, and the high-dose regimen of lincosamide antibiotic, 
lincomycin, to demonstrate the efficacy of the combined delivery concept in 
combating the bacterial resistance. The anti-bacterial actions of the AgNPs and 
the lincomycin as single entities and as part of the combined mixture of the 
AgNPs-lincomycin showed improved anti-bacterial biological activity in the 
Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis microorganisms in comparison to the AgNPs 
and lincomycin alone. The comparison of the anti-biofilm formation tendency, 
minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) suggested additive effects of the AgNPs and lincomycin combination 
co-delivery. The AgNPs' MIC at 100 μg/mL and MBC at 100 μg/mL for both Bacillus 
cereus and Proteus mirabilis, respectively, together with the AgNPs-lincomycin 
mixture MIC at 100 + 12.5 μg/mL for Bacillus cereus and 50 + 12.5 μg/mL for 
Proteus mirabilis, confirmed the efficacy of the mixture. The growth curve test 
showed that the AgNPs required 90 min to kill both bacterial isolates. The 
freshly prepared and well-characterized AgNPs, important for the antioxidant 
activity levels of the AgNPs material, showed radical scavenging potential that 
increased with the increasing concentrations. The DPPH's best activity 
concentration, 100 μg/mL, which is also the best concentration exhibiting the 
highest anti-bacterial zone inhibition, was chosen for evaluating the combined 
effects of the antibiotic, lincomycin, and the AgNPs. Plausible genotoxic 
effects and the roles of AgNPs were observed through decreased Bla gene 
expressions in the Bacillus cereus and BlaCTX-M-15 gene expressions in the 
Proteus mirabilis."
2148,"Cinnamaldehyde (CNA), the main component of cinnamon essential oil, is one of 
the most active plant compounds against nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa. Exposure of wild-type strain PA14 (MIC 700 µg/mL) for 5 to 10 days 
to fixed (900 µg/mL) or increasing (from 900 to 1400 µg/mL) concentrations of 
this natural antibacterial resulted in emergence of resistant mutants CNA-A1 to 
A3, and CNA-B1 to B7, respectively. Genome sequencing experiments showed that 
each of CNA-A1 to A3 mutants differed from PA14 by one SNP, and a slight 
increase in CNA resistance level (from 700 to 900 µg/mL). By comparison, mutants 
B1 to B7 were more resistant (up to 1100 µg/mL); each of them harbored multiple 
SNPs (from 24 to 39) likely as a consequence of alteration of DNA mismatch 
repair gene mutS. Of the ten mutants selected, eight contained mutations in gene 
nalC, which indirectly downregulates expression of the operon that codes for 
multidrug efflux system MexAB-OprM, and showed increased resistance (up to 
16-fold versus PA14) to antibiotic molecules exported by the pump, including 
ß-lactams and fluoroquinolones. Of the six mutants with the highest CNA 
resistance, five were no longer motile because of alteration of genes flgJ, fliE 
and/or pilJ genes. Altogether, our data show that P. aeruginosa is able to adapt 
to strong electrophilic molecules such as CNA by upregulating its intrinsic 
efflux pump MexAB-OprM, and through less well-characterized pleiotropic changes. 
Whether multidrug-resistant mutants can emerge in patients using cinnamon 
essential oil as self-medication needs to be assessed further."
2149,"Pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli threaten public health due to their 
virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. Additionally, the virulence of this 
bacterium varies by region depending on environmental conditions, agricultural 
practices, and the use of antibiotics and disinfectants. However, there is 
limited research on the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant E. coli in 
agriculture. Therefore, this research aimed to determine the antibiotic 
resistance of E. coli isolated from the Honeydew melon production system in 
Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. Thirty-two E. coli strains were isolated from 445 
samples obtained from irrigation water, harvested melons, the hands of packaging 
workers, boxes, and discarded melons. The resistance profile of the E. coli 
strains was carried out to 12 antibiotics used in antimicrobial therapeutics 
against this bacterium; a high level of resistance to ertapenem (100%) was 
detected, followed by meropenem (97%), and ampicillin (94%); 47% of the strains 
were classified as multidrug-resistant. It was possible to identify the 
prevalence of the extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBLs) gene blaTEM (15.6%), as 
well as the non-ESBL genes qepA (3.1%) and aac(6')lb-cr (3.1%). The E. coli 
strains isolated from irrigation water were significantly associated with 
resistance to aztreonam, cefuroxime, amikacin, and 
sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Irrigation water, packing workers' hands, and 
discarded melons showed a higher prevalence of antibiotic-resistant, ESBL, and 
non-ESBL genes of E. coli strains in a farm and packing facility of Honeydew 
melon in Hermosillo, Sonora."
2150,"With the development of sequencing technology and further scientific research, 
an increasing number of biosynthetic gene clusters associated with secondary 
Streptomyces metabolites have been identified and characterized. The encoded 
genes of a family of regulators designated as PAS-LuxR are gradually being 
discovered in some biosynthetic gene clusters of polyene macrolide, 
aminoglycoside, and amino acid analogues. PAS-LuxR family regulators affect 
secondary Streptomyces metabolites by interacting with other family regulators 
to regulate the transcription of the target genes in the gene cluster. This 
paper provides a review of the structure, function, regulatory mechanism, and 
application of these regulators to provide more information on the regulation of 
secondary metabolite biosynthesis in Streptomyces, and promote the application 
of PAS-LuxR family regulators in industrial breeding and other directions."
